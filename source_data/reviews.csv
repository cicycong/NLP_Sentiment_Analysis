Playa Cabana	4	2020-02-26	"I was tasked with finding a spot for a group dinner of eight and landed on Playa Cabana. It was pretty easy to make a reservation via their email system and our table was ready upon arrival. I don't know why I was expecting more of a kitschy Mexican restaurant, but that's not what we got. Instead, it was very intimate and cozy and the service was stellar... We had a great night!

To start, we opted for some guac which was tasty and had a nice little kick to it. To eat, I split the elotes a la parrilla and an order of tacos al pastor with my husband. The soft tacos come in an order of three but you can add on a fourth, so we did that to share evenly. It was the perfect amount of food for us, especially since the tortilla chips kept flowing! The pork in the tacos was seasoned very well. I'm used to the meat being cubed rather than in strips, so this was different but still tasty. They really packed in the filling, so I left super full. 

To sip, we shared pitches of mojitos which were nice and strong... The drink menu was quite lengthy and again, perfect for our group of revelers. 

Mexican in Canada seemed like a risky choice, but this was an ideal meal for us! Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for tacos OR a nice group dinner joint."
Playa Cabana	3	2019-08-04	"Went here with my friends and family. I liked the spice side fillings and their lobster tacos was good I heard. I had the veggie enchiladas and was alright. Even the veggie tostadas was good. However, I feel the food was expensive for the food quality.
We got the 
Nachos  - small but good
Guacamole and chips - good needed some spice 
Chicken wings - so so 
Veggie enchiladas - was so so 
Veggie burrito - good 
Veggie tostados - good
Shrimp enchiladas - was so so 
Lobster tacos - very good 
Fish tacos - very good 
Pork tacos - was so so"
Playa Cabana	3	2019-08-24	"Surprisingly good Flautas! They came as 3 rolls made of a crunchy tortilla containing lots of shredded juicy beef (although I thought it tasted more like pork haha). It all sat in a pool of thick savoury sauce that wasn't overly salty. I also tried their White Wine Sangria, $60 for a pitcher was OK for this citrusy drink with a decent amount of alcohol! 

TIP: if you're celebrating a birthday, let the staff know and they'll surprise the bday person with a hat, song & free slice of a DELICIOUS dulce Leche soaked cake !

Otherwise, the indoor seating space is really tight and the service was subpar."
Playa Cabana	4	2019-06-06	"As a Mexican I always crave authentic Mexican food in Toronto but have difficulties finding it. Playa Cabana is very good and does a an amazing job at keeping things as authentic as possible.

Today at lunch I had the chips and salsa which were yummy. The Playa Burrito with Pork Carnitas was also very good. The green salsa was a bit citrusy but overall very good. I would order it again.

This is definitely a place to come back for some great Mexican food. Staff were also friendly and fast."
Playa Cabana	5	2020-05-25	Best tacos I've ever had. Both locations are great and offer a great selection of Mexican fare.
Playa Cabana	4	2019-08-31	"Food was exceptional and service was pretty fast. It's in a weird location tho only visited because it was about 10 minute walk from the ROM.
Only issues was the seating area was a bit small inside so you feel squished. But they have some more spots outside for when it's a nice day. I recommend to anyone who wants to try real authentic Mexican food. Everything tastes fresh and makes you want to order more."
Playa Cabana	4	2019-04-07	"Their space is a bit cramped, but Playa Cabana makes it work.

I'm a big fan of Mexican and am of the opinion that Toronto is starving of good Mexican food. Playa Cabana, thankfully, does it well.

I had one of their cocktails and found it decent. Food-wise, I had the carnitas burrito, which was also decent.

Next time, I'll take advantage of the all you can eat chips + guac suggestion that others have made!"
Playa Cabana	4	2019-01-16	"Okay, so I found my new favourite Latin spot. I was frequenting the other Playa Cabana on Dundas W - however they changed their menu and all went to hell in my opinion. I recently dined at Playa Cabana and was wow'd. This place really needs 5 stars because the food was AMAZING, but it gets 4 stars because the service was pretty bad. 

It wasn't busy at all when I walked in, maybe 2 tables were full. I kinda already knew what I wanted (who else checks the menu before hand) lol. 

Ordered the short rib tacos because holy hell it sounded amazing, short rib enchiladas (yes, I love short rib) grilled Mexican corn, the tres leche cake & Churros. Relax, relax, I wasn't alone. The tacos were delicious, please please don't change the menu! I have to say the Enchiladas were my favourite. The beans had so much flavour, the sauces were perfect & the combination of all the flavours with the extra sauces on the table made my life complete! The grilled corn was okay, but nothing special. 

Moving on to the highlight - Dessert! Wow! The Churros were actually fucking amazing. So crunchy, so much sugar. The cake was nothing like I've tasted, so moist and light. I could have eaten 3 slices! 

PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THE MENU! I will be back! 

Keep Eating, 
Angela"
Playa Cabana	4	2019-12-12	Went last week. Food is very good! Churros were amazing  and drinks are made with fair amount of alcohol compared to other places. Friendly staff! Would recommended! Make sure to make reservations as it is a very very cozy place. Unless you don't mind sitting at the bar, as I did.
Playa Cabana	4	2019-01-12	"Yes all day er'rday to their chips -- they make a fresh batch each day! No pic of that here since we ate them so fast along with the fresh red salsa.

The Baja fried fish tacos were delicious... I don't even really like fish (unless we're talking about specific sushi rolls) but I gobbled these tacos up. 

I'm looking forward to trying the other locations as I think the menus differ slightly. Nice place!"
Playa Cabana	4	2018-05-13	"I was skeptical of this place at first as it look like I'm walking into a duplex, but man was I wrong. I should know that hole in the walls are the best kind. The service probably could have been better which is why the 4 and not the 5. 

The chips are amazing, freshly made, hot and the perfect amount of salt. The salsa you could tell was just made and that it all came straight from the garden. 

My favorite was the short rib taqueria. The short ribs alone I could have eaten bowls of it, full of flavor and so tender. 

The carnitas tacos were also tender but my favorite was the crispy skin, so crunchy and probably oh so bad for me.

The fish tacos were really good too, nice and flaky."
Playa Cabana	4	2018-04-21	"Playa Cabana is a pretty small restaurant, so I made a reservation for 2 for 7pm on a Wednesday night - we were seated immediately, and there were still a few other tables free around us. The place started to get quite busy at around 8, so it's definitely worth making a reservation especially if you're going with as a party larger than 2.

Even though it can feel a bit cramped, the service and food were good. I got the baja fish tacos (comes in a set of 3) - the fish was really good, but I feel like it could have used a bit more guac/sauce around the sides, as it sometimes tasted a bit bland. I wasn't full after the 3 tacos, but generally have a pretty big appetite! 

Overall, I still enjoyed my time, but am not sure if I would return at this price point."
Playa Cabana	3	2018-09-07	"My friend and I decided on Mexican food for dinner and this popped up as nearby where we were at the time, Yorkville/Annex area. As we walked in, immediately we're greeted and seated in a tight space for 2. The menu was explained to us and water was given, then we were left for a few minutes to decide. 

We decided on salsa fresca & chips, chicken enchiladas suizas and short rib emmoladas along with a bottle each of corona and negra cervezas.

Salsa fresca and chips arrived first, the tomato salsa was delicious, the morita chile seemed to have been grilled before it was mashed together with tomatoes and red onions and went well with the crispy chips. (If you come for anything at all, this would be it and definitely skip the guac as it didn't seem appetizing.)

My friend and I shared the chicken enchiladas suizas and short rib emmoladas, while tasty, I could've gotten it somewhere else for cheaper. 

Because of how tight the space is, I was able to look around at what the other dinners ordered and the the tacos seemed to be more popular, so will have to come back and try those.

We also ordered alfajores, which at $8 for 2 was just meh."
Playa Cabana	5	2018-10-04	I'm a long-term fan of Playa Cabana restaurants, and this one is my favourite. The restaurant is quite small, so it's best to make reservation ahead of time. Everything from their ceviche, guacamole, poblano-corn crab cakes, and avocado & black beans salad, to tacos and burritos are some of the best I've tried in the GTA. My go-to dishes are the lobster tacos and side avocado & black beans salad. The lobster tacos come in crunchy hard shells filled with large, tender pieces of lobster meat, and queso cheese.
Playa Cabana	4	2018-01-25	"Playa Cabana is about a 15 minute walk from my office and I hadn't planned on going there but the person I had an appointment with nearby wasn't available so I decided to have lunch first.

Walking in, it's a very narrow, small space, almost claustraphobic. The dim lighting didn't help but it set an intimate mood for the place. This looks like a nice neighbourhood watering hole and the immediate neighbourhood is mostly residential.

I ordered the Tostadas with beef and it was served on a crispy tortilla, topped with lettuce, guacamole, black beans, and a few other ingredients.

The presentation was nice and the taste was even nicer! With layers of ingredients, every bite revealed a different flavour and texture and they all worked well together. Delicious!

There were four different sauces on the table, with varying degrees of heat. I tried them all and they were all good.

I may just have to make this walk more often."
Playa Cabana	5	2019-04-03	Best salsa ever! Honestly everything was really good and so was the service and the atmosphere. We had guacamole, salsa, octopus, short rib (my favorite) and Baha fish tacos and Curro Putin. The only thing that was not great was the espresso I had at the end, but really who cares? This place deserves all the great reviews it has.
Playa Cabana	3	2018-08-13	"I've been duped by yelp reviews!! We were given recommendations for this place as a great lunch spot which was super cute inside and patio area was so inviting. The stars were for the decor and the one dish! 

Food we ordered:
Chile Rellenos- with rice and black beans- this was the star dish for sure, two large chille rellenos and delicious rice. Sauce was tasty as well. 

Guacamole- prepared guacamole probably mixed with fresh avocado, you can just tell it's from a bag because it's watery instead of creamy. Not special at all

Grilled fish tacos- this is so upsetting, they said it was bass, well it's not. If it was it's the mushiest bass I've ever eaten. Three little tacos that that hid the tiny piece of fish for $19 bucks! Sad don't get this

So disappointed"
Playa Cabana	5	2019-04-05	"My bf and I decided to come to this Mexican restaurant to celebrate his birthday after reading such good reviews about the tacos - and we can now confirm they taste just as good as they look! 

We started with the chips and guacamole (which was more than plentiful for 2 people and was super fresh!) and Dave's Margaritas to wash it all down. For tacos, they come in a set of 3, and we opted for the Short Rib Brisket Crispy Tacos, Baja Style Fish Tacos, and the Al Pastor Tacos. The Short Rib and Baja Fish Tacos were by far our favourites of the 3. The Short Rib was tender, juicy, flavourful and served with guac, pico de gallo and cotija cheese on a crispy corn tortilla that had a layer of melted cheese at the base. YUM! The Baja Fish tacos (served with fresh lime and cabbage slaw) were also equally delicious and we fell in love with the batter. If you love a good fish taco, these are the ones to get!

Since we both love pineapple we knew we had to get the Al Pastor tacos, however, we were disappointed when our tacos did not arrive with the roasted pineapple as listed on the menu (but instead a slice of mandarin?). While the pork was flavourful, it was our least favourite of the three... and we were really looking forward to the pineapple!

For dessert, we got the Churro Poutine, which for $10 was a bit pricey for 3 small churros. Served in a cup with caramel sauce and marshmellow curds (we opted out of the marshmellow), they were perfectly fried and warm with a soft center and crisp cinnamon-sugar outside. Definitely satisfied our sweet tooth!

It's a small restaurant so plan ahead and make a reservation! Our server was super friendly and service was quick. Plus, the tacos were seriously some of our favourites we've had - you can't go wrong."
Playa Cabana	5	2019-02-01	"Let me just say right off the bat: THEY HAVE ALL YOU CAN EAT CHIPS AND GUACAMOLE!!!!!!!!!
You can literally buy a large chips and guacamole for 6 dollars and just keep eating until your full. For seven people!!!!!! I would know I've done it!
It's literally heaven! 
There other food is amazing as well but c'mon!
After the eight refills of my large platter of chips and quacamole I was in no position to complain"
Playa Cabana	5	2017-09-18	"Love this place! I had a mad craving for tacos one day, so I took a detour on my way home from work and stopped in for some Mexican fare. 

Obviously, I'm not Mexican and I have actually never even been to Mexico, so I'm definitely not qualified to speak about the authenticity of the food here, but I most certainly can comment on the flavours and presentation of the food. My opinion is WOW... just Wow. Seriously delicious food. I had the octopus tacos, guacamole with chips and finished off with crab cakes. I also had a beer, but in hindsight I should've had a margarita instead. They looked delicious! 

I tried a few different hot sauces, and boy, were they good! A couple were a bit too hot for me, but I enjoyed trying them. I put a couple of drops of each one onto the guacamole as I devoured it, so I could see which one I liked best. 

The octopus tacos were perfection. I should've ordered double and skipped the crab cakes, as they were not as enjoyable for me. The guacamole was fantastic and I loved the house made chips. 

Service was exceptional. I sat at the bar on my own and everyone was extremely friendly and I felt very welcome. Oftentimes, when dining solo, I feel a bit out of place or ignored. Not the case here. It seemed that the staff really went out of their way to make me feel at ease and ensure that I had a good experience. What a difference this makes in a dining experience. 

Can't wait to go back for more tacos!!"
Wilbur Mexicana	5	2020-03-31	"Wilbur is a great place for fast casual mexican food if you are spending some time downtown. They are in the heart of the King Street West Entertainment District so getting there is easy if you are using public transportation. 

I love their taco selection. I generally get the fish and beef options anywhere I go but I really love the mushroom taco at Wilburs. The best part of going to the restaurant itself is their selection of delicious hot sauces and salsa options! 

I like that they are a hybrid self serve restaurant. You order at the bar and they bring the food to you but you have to get up and help yourself to the (unlimited) water from the cooler and also the sauces. 

I can't wait for the warm weather to go sit on the patio at Wilburs and watch the crowds walk by on King West."
Wilbur Mexicana	4	2020-03-30	"This busy place has some damn tasty tacos. While I normally really chase the 'authenticity' dragon when it comes to tacos, I do really enjoy this place as well.

Pros: 
1. The menu is simple and straightforward. You can get tacos and bowls, the choices are pretty clear. 
2. The fillings/meats are all pretty good. I really enjoy the Al pastor and the Korean taco. The flavours are beautiful for those.
3. An insane choice of many kinds of salsa, and you can choose and take as much as you want - pretty amazing.

Cons:
1. The trendy place is always busy and loud. Not great if you want to talk to someone while grabbing a bite. Despite the busy-ness, however, orders are done pretty quickly, usually (that's a pro ).
2. The guac portions are tiny, but that's most places these days."
Wilbur Mexicana	4	2020-03-27	"WHAT TO TRY?!

The Mexican corn!! I love their corn with that wonderful seasoning! The quesadillas are are also delicious too especially when it comes piping hot and the tortilla is lightly pan fried. The sauce is a great mix which makes it more flavourful. 

I liked the baja fried fish tacos the most out of all the tacos because it had the right combination of garnishes and the tortilla is corn over flour. The bulgogi taco was a bit too sweet for my liking tho. It is flavorful and full of sauce but the marinade they used for that taco may be too much. 

I also tried the avocado taco. It's a grilled quarter piece of avocado in the tortilla. I would have liked it if it wasn't that big of a chunk tho because although outside is grilled, inside is just plain old avocado. Having sliced a bit more thinner would have been nicer. 

The mushroom taco is a good vegetarian alternative for tacos and comes with great flavour. Lots of mushrooms but it's not some fancy mushrooms. Just regular mushrooms though. 

The asada, pork and chicken tacos are always a good staple to have for tacos. They are cooked with a lot of flavours which are great!

LAST TIP?!

They have water for free so if you are fine with water as a refreshment, then don't have to worry about ordering any other drinks. Quesadillas come with guacamole and chips on the side so no need to order more guacamole and chips as a snack! However tacos only come with chips, no complimentary guacamole - just something to keep in mind!"
Wilbur Mexicana	4	2020-03-07	"I visited this place on a weekday evening. They don't have any table reservations and it's the first come basis. You place your order on the counter and then go and find yourself a table. The food is delivered at the table. There is a common area where water & cutlery is available for self service.

The place stands out from the other Mexican places because of their Salsa counter. They have 7 different kinds of Salsas which are free with your meal. Try some of the spicy salsas at your own risk. Their Ghost Salsa is extremely spicy. Now, let's talk about food. I tried their Veggie Burrito, Mushroom Tacos & Grilled Avocado Taco. The portion sizes were good and value for money. They serve complimentary tortilla chips with every entree. Burritos had a quinoa filling but you can upgrade to rice for 1 dollar. Tacos were really good with a nice blend of sauces. For my taste buds, burrito felt a little dry though. Overall, a nice place to try some Mexican options."
Wilbur Mexicana	5	2020-02-03	"I would give this resto ten stars if I could. 

The food is to die for. 

You walk in and they have the menu up on the wall but they also have more detailed menus you can  hold and chose from. 

They have wine and margaritas on draft. The Pinot Grigio is wonderful. 

The Mexican street corn is the best dish I've had to eat in a long time. 

The fish taco is hands down the best taco I've ever had. 

They have over 40 different styles of hot sauce, and then they have 8 different sauces you can scoop and bring with you. The pineapple mango and the habanero ones are really  tasty. 

Very cute decor.
The bathrooms are unisex and very clean. 
The staff is high energy and good vibes."
Wilbur Mexicana	4	2020-01-11	"The menu is simple and the atmosphere has good vibes. Casual but hip decor. And gender neutral bathrooms. Street style tacos, cafeteria style dining, and self service sauce bar.

You order and pay at the front, take your table flag, and they bring the food to you.

We tried the Mexican corn and 3 of their tacos. The Mexican corn had a nice amount of seasoning and a very good presence of lime. Tart and flavourful, with a slight kick. 

The carne asada was my favourite. It has a good flavour and in my opinion embodies the essence of what the standard beef taco should taste like. 

The al pastor had meat which was very juicy, and the pineapple provides a good bit of sweet and tang to help cut through the tortilla. Although the meat was juicy, the taco itself was very dry in the mouth. But a little extra lime, and it was a more enjoyable experience.

The unoriginal had a nice flavour, but it wasn't memorable enough for me to note anything other than ""its chicken, and it tastes pretty good""

Overall a good place for a quick bite or a meetup with a few drinks. If you go, make sure to stock up on extra lime."
Wilbur Mexicana	5	2020-03-12	"This place is always packed, and tonight I found out why.

Wilbur is casual; you order your tacos, burritos, or quesadillas at the counter and you find whatever seating you can (you'll most likely have to share a table with strangers). 

However, this is not a Chipotle:

- The prices are definitely higher...
- .... But the quality of food is immeasurably better (we're talking buttery, flaky, crispy fish tacos and a burrito bowl expertly mixed with guac, carne asada and queso fundido all grooving together)
- They have margaritas on tap - and they're actually AWESOME

Don't worry about the line, it moves fast. Just go!"
Wilbur Mexicana	5	2020-03-10	Simple, fast, delicious. This place is super popular and has lines that extend out the door (for good reason!) but it moves fast and is worth the short wait. Free salsa and hot sauce bar are an awesome addition.
Wilbur Mexicana	5	2020-03-16	"Really good tacos.
Must try bulgogi beef tat I, if you can handle a little bit spicy.
Pork taco is also very good.
Maybe want to try fish ones too.
All tacos come with a few chips. But there have many different salsa you can try.

Overall the flavour is strong and tasty.
A little bit pricy, I saw somewhere the menu showed 3.5 each, but is at least 4.5 each.

A little bit long waiting time, and you need to find your own seats. But it's good environment and really food, definitely worth waiting."
Wilbur Mexicana	5	2019-11-12	"Came here early for dinner on a weekend so there weren't too many people. But when we started to leave there was a line to order and not enough seats.

You order in front, get seated and they will bring you your order. The service was quick and friendly. 

We ordered the elotes and every taco on the menu. 
Favourites:
- elotes - creamy, sweet and savoury but kind of pricey for one corn 
- the unoriginal 
- carne asade
- baja fish 
- All the meats have great flavour, and not dry. Fish was nicely fried to a light crunch.

I love the salsa bar! So many options! I especially love the pineapple salsa, gave a nice sweet punch to some tacos. 

The seating area is not that large but it is fast-paced whereas people leave after they finish. 

Tacos are ok size, probably would have to order 3 to be full. I would say the price is not as bad as other places. I'd love to come back and try their other items!"
Wilbur Mexicana	3	2019-12-14	"Great spot if you wanna get some quick tacos or burritos.

There was a huge variety of options to order and al for a fair price however there was a huge lack of flavour in anything you ate until you added sauces from their sauce bar(which was great). I felt like I was getting grilled vegetables flavoured with salt and wrapped in a tortilla. 

My stars are really going towards the tomatillo sauce which really saved the day."
Wilbur Mexicana	5	2020-03-02	"Wilbur Mexicana is a vibrant taqueria located on King West, great for grabbing a quick bite before going out nearby in the area. There's always a line but it's always worth it. You can either grab your tacos for takeout or eat-in where staff bring your food over to you after paying up front. Tacos here are very reasonably priced, ranging from $3.95-4.95. 

I got The Unoriginal, a chicken taco, and a Carne Asada (Steak). Both were amazing but the clear standout was the Carne Asada. It was packed with flavour; the meat was smokey and savoury but also very tender and soft. It was nicely complimented with some pico de gallo, queso fundido and crispy onions. 

What makes Wilbur Mexicana unique in terms of taco joints is their wide array of sauces they have to offer. They have, i think, 6 or 7, homemade sauces ranging from pico de gallo to ghost pepper available for you to grab as much of. They also have a whole shelf of bottled sauces, at least 20-30+ unique ones if I had to guess. So if you like your tacos packed with heat, Wilbur is definitely a place to try!"
Wilbur Mexicana	5	2019-10-10	"One of our favourite taco spots in the city. Just go there for true hot sauce bar. Truly fantastic.
Their tacos are so delicious. I think we have tried all the different kinds and each one is so good! My absolute favourite is the fish though. The chicken comes in a close second. Burritos are also super delicious. With a great variety of toppings and just perfectly rolled, truly very satisfying.
Service is super fast and nice. The vibe is so nice, casual yet fancy.  Drinks on tap, beer and wine available. Highly recommend for great tacos!"
Wilbur Mexicana	5	2020-01-09	"My favourite Mexican fast food restaurant! By fast food, I mean you order and pay upfront (with no tip necessary) and they will bring the food when ready.

Seating is limited so sharing the table with others is needed. However given it is fast food restaurant, a lot of people choose to grab and go instead. The deco is very friendly and has the casual Mexican vibe. 

Last time I was here I ordered the $4.5 classic taco. It came with chips that you can dip in a varieties of free salsa (some spicy, some refreshing and none to complain about) and hot sauce. I think it is good value and quite tasty. However the lady who we shared the table with ordered the Fajita, a ""sizzling"" skillet that is worth being jealous over. 

So when we went there tonight, I did not hesitate to order the chicken Fajita and wow it did not disappoint. The skillet was sizzling hot when presented. You can hear the sizzling sound and smelled amazing. The chicken is flavourful with some peppers and onion. The chicken by itself could have been too oily or too salty but the skillet came with taco bread, guacamole (amazingly fresh and probably made in store) and fresh lettuce. I was really impressed by this dish and definitely became one of my favourite.

I think this place could be busy sometime and the wait time would be long. But with food this good (and free salsa), I think it is worth the wait. I will definitely will go back :)"
Wilbur Mexicana	5	2019-09-03	"Since my first Wilbur visit I have ventured back my times and each better then the last!

The Fajitas in general are outstanding and at 18$ they make for good value too considering you can share easily

Ohhh and chips with Guac are a must!

........me encanta."
Wilbur Mexicana	3	2019-07-23	"For what this spot is, it's fine. It's a King Street taco spot serving the King West crowd. Meaning, it's a bit overpriced (my dining companion asked me ""Are you SURE you only want 3 tacos...?"" while I was ordering) and a bit gimmicky for my liking. To be fair, I was coming off of having some fabulous tacos a couple of days ago at a little neighbourhood takeout where they mostly serve Latinx locals, AND I'm generally not a fan of anything fusion.

You grab a table and then line up to order and pay cafeteria-style. Then you go to the salsa bar for a very good variety of salsas and pico de gallo. Servers bring the food when it's ready. 

The food itself was fine, though don't order the grilled avocado if you don't eat dairy. It's literally just a grilled avocado. Even a healthy amount of pico de gallo and salsa couldn't save it. I found the tortillas really dry.

Atmosphere is cool and the people watching is pretty great. It was very busy with the after-work crowd. I don't think I'd return if I was craving tacos, but I would definitely hang out on their expanded sidewalk patio for a drink and some chips and guacamole."
Wilbur Mexicana	4	2020-04-27	Nice little spot for a casual lunch with friends! Lots of different options for tacos, and the ones I tried were delicious!
Wilbur Mexicana	5	2019-08-03	"I found this place after simply yelping tacos in the area. Wilbur had amazing reviews so we decided to walk to this place from the CN Tower. When we got there the line was out the door and around the corner so we knew it was a popping place. 

The highlight of this restaurant is the salsa bar. There was over 8 sauces ranging from mild to spicy. 

Elote 5/5
I LOVE elote! This dish came with two corn on the cobs that were generously smothered in cheese, sauce and greatness. 

Fish taco 5/5 
It was lightly battered with slaw on top and my boyfriend added the verde salsa on top. 

California burrito with steak 5/5
The portion was huge. It had great flavors and we added the haberno salsa on top. 

Grilled avocado taco 5/5
I love avocados so this taco was perfect. I added the ghost salsa on top and it was amazing. 

Each dish comes with a side of chips. Pricing is reasonable and there is plenty of choices on the menu."
Wilbur Mexicana	5	2019-12-06	"Absolutely the most delicious and fresh Mexican food that is affordable and in a sit down place with great service. I could go on and on and on about how much I love Wilbur. This place ticks all the boxes for me. It's a lowkey place with great food but not too lowkey so you don't have to hold your food in your hand while eating on the sidewalk because they only have room for 2 inside. 

You order at the front and take a table number and they bring your food to you. I've tried their veggie burrito, veggie tacos, chips and salsa and chips and queso. I honestly think you can't go wrong here, everything I've had has been delicious. I would highly recommend their hot sauce bar, you have access to a large variety of hot sauces, and they're even ordered by level of spiciness. What I like to do is a pseudo hot ones challenge with the different hot sauces and tortilla chips. I'd also highly recommend exploring the salsa bar, the ghost pepper salsa is delicious!

The overall vibes of Wilbur makes it a cool place to hang out and its clear a lot of people feel this way because there's normally a line out the door to get in. I'll definitely be revisiting, this is one of my favourite spots in city."
Wilbur Mexicana	3	2019-12-08	"Gringo af. Lunch and dinner lines go out the door. Don't come here for your undersalted chips and measly-portioned guac. The meat was kind of too salty and even having three tacos made me want a fourth. I guess it's FINE that there's fish tacos but it's kind of overrated. Where is the cilantro?!?! 

I have had better. It's got an Assembly Chef's Hall vibe. It's loud, jammed full of working professionals. Only come here if everything else is closed."
Como En Casa	5	2020-05-18	I have been going to Como En Casa for at least a few years now. I mostly get take out but have also dined in as well. The food is always authentic and fresh. The prices are fair for the generous servings. My go to selection is the pork burrito and I have never been disappointed. The staff are friendly and welcoming.
Como En Casa	5	2020-05-25	"Great tasting, authentic Mexican food! I ordered the 12"" burrito with pork that was tender beyond belief. 
The rice and beans were on point as well! 


The staff were also very friendly and I look forward to supporting this local business again :)"
Como En Casa	4	2019-08-29	"Important !!!! The menu on Yelp is NOT up to date. The prices have changed significantly (I've attached the latest menu). 

Was a tad bit slow to get started (host was talking to a couple eating, when we went to go get a menu ourselves the host told us to wait and he would bring us a menu, but then proceeded to talk to continue talking to the couple for a little bit). Asides from this, service was very good and the host was very generous.

I proceeded to purchase the chicken mole which was very good. The sauce was definitely the best part, it wasn't necessarily sweet or salty, it was just good. This was accompanied by some dark meat chicken which was very tender as well - not so much seasoned but the sauce was enough. The rice and beans were solid as well. Would definitely come here again next time I'm in Toronto"
Como En Casa	3	2019-07-07	"Rating: 3/5

Summary: 
We believe this restaurant is worth a visit if in the area. We have frequented this place multiple times and there is a reason we keep coming back. The service is extremely friendly and the atmosphere, though tight, is rather warm and welcoming. However, one must be careful when picking their dish because while some taste wonderfully flavorful, others are somewhat disappointing.

The dishes we tried: 
- burrito w/ verde sauce
- fish tacos
- chicken enchiladas
- chicken mole
- guac/salsa w/ chips
- mains circa $12-15
- appetizers circa $6-8

Food:
One of our favorite dishes is the Burrito with Verde Sauce. It's a big hot burrito packed with many flavors. What makes it special, however, is the verde sauce that complements the burrito very well. The verde sauce is a tangy and spicy sauce that consists of tomatillos, jalapenos, and lime. You probably won't get burritos smothered with a delicious sauce at other places where you'd think of getting a burrito (Chipotle, etc.). We'd also point out that the Guacamole tastes extremely fresh with a great rich and creamy feel. The chunky and spicy salsa is also great. The two dipping sauces pair well with the tortilla chips and is worth considering if looking for an appetizer.

However, we were disappointed with some of the dishes we ordered. For example, the enchiladas and chicken mole did not satisfy at all. As for the enchiladas, the ones we had were filled with extremely dry chicken and the wrap itself was also unappetizing.

On a positive note, the service is remarkable. The owner once even gave us a free refill for our horchata (a most delightful sweet drink consisting of rice, vanilla, and cinnamon). The servers are very kind and patient, thus contributing to a better dining experience.

Conclusion: 
Google reviews rates this as a 4.5/5. We give it a 3/5. It's worth a visit if in the area, but there are only certain dishes worth eating. We recommend the chicken or burrito with verde sauce and the horchata.

Como En Casa	5	2019-03-26	"I walked by this tiny whole in the wall for about a year before finally checking it out and i'm definitely glad i did! There seemed to be a lot of regulars, lots of people grabbing take out and got packed pretty quick. 

 I got the hybrid burrito which came with two kinds of salsas, and got it with half steak and half pulled pork,  which i'd highly recommend. the portions were huge and surprisingly affordable. Be careful with the special house salsa that is on all the tables, it's amazing but definitely adds a kick!!"
Como En Casa	5	2019-07-22	"Came here with my Spanish class of 7 after our last class. All 7 out of 7 of us polished our plates until it was shiny clean.

I ordered the tamales with mole chicken, with rice and beans. It came with a side of salsa, which I had refilled. BEST RICE AND BEANS I'VE EVER HAD!!! Want to cry just thinking about it. It was a revelation. And the tamales were very aromatic. The salsa was just the perfect kick to tie it all together.

Basically the best Mexican food I've ever had in Toronto."
Como En Casa	5	2019-03-04	"We were around the area and we were craving authentic Mexican food and boy we were glad we found this place! The portion is generous and the food is very affordable! I love how the burrito is on a plate sauced all over the burrito. The burrito was very flavourful and it wasn't dry at all! 

Definitely will go back here again."
Como En Casa	4	2019-04-25	Como En Casa is a cheap and cheerful place to get a spicy lunch or supper fix. Recently, I enjoyed a three taco meal with beans and rice. It was filling, tasty and hit the spot. Nothing mind blowing here, but it's delicious no frills Mexican. Bonus points for being on Uber Eats.
Como En Casa	4	2018-07-10	"This is one of my favourite little spots to hit up in core downtown Toronto when I'm just looking for something quick to eat. 

The restaurant is small, crowded in feel, so get close to you next table neighbour. The cashier and perhaps owner or family member of the owner, like to point out the picture version of the menu to the right of the door as you enter. Portions sizes are large enough to give you your fill for lunch. 

I got the fish tacos. Well fried with a well seasons fish, which is sweet and moist. There is like a coleslaw that tops it along with pickled onion slices. All of this along with hot sauces creates this lovely mix of salty, umami, sweet, sour, and spicy. What a delight. This is all held together by two 6"" corn tortilla, which in my opinion is a little small for the size of the fish. 

The Jamaica is made from hibiscus and is sweet, earthy, and tart and is a lovely refreshing beverage for nice summer day. 

The one critique is the price but I mean prices are just generally higher everywhere no a days. But the price combined with the small space that forces intimacy between strangers keep this space from being a full 5 stars. The food and the service make this place a 4.5 star location for me."
Como En Casa	5	2018-09-21	"Came here for a quick dinner after work with my girlfriend and we were pleasantly surprised with the food!

You order your food at the counter and they bring the food to your table. 

We got a quesadilla and a taco dinner plate. The price for the amount of food you get was great, especially in downtown! 

The workers were very friendly and happy to answer any questions we had about the menu. Our food was better than what expected and met our Mexican food cravings! Definitely will come again!"
Como En Casa	4	2019-11-30	Found this place by chance...and really glad I did. I can't say that I'm an expert on Mexican food, but I know good quality food when I eat it...and this was really good. I've had Mexican food a number of times, and would say this was best by far. Very small, and certainly not high end interior, but cozy.  Great place for a quick, well priced and delicious bite. I'll be back.
Como En Casa	5	2018-08-16	"TLDR: Fantastic staff and service, good homey atmosphere and some of the best Mexican I've had in Toronto.

I came here after work one day for dinner. Upon walking in the menu is on a giant poster to your right and it lists out a couple options (no more than 20) and you order and pay at the counter before getting served. As soon as I walked in one of the staff immediately greeted me and welcomed me to the restaurant. I don't usually comment on service, but the service I revived from multiple staff at Como En Casa was absolutely amazing and therefore noteworthy.

I got the enchiladas ($13), which came with rice and beans as well. The chicken enchiladas came in threes with the mole sauce surrounding it, a white sauce drizzled on top of it and some lettuce and a type of cheese stacked on top if it as well. The chicken inside was very soft and overall the enchiladas were delicious. The mole added a nice kick to it as well. The rice was well-seasoned and very tasty and I could've easily downed a couple more servings of it. I'm not usually a bean guy, but the beans were prepared very well here as well. They were mashed to a thick-ish consistency and the taste of the beans was not overwhelming, which I usually find at other restaurants. The meal also came with a homemade mild-hot sauce which was also very good. I think my only complaint is that the portions could've been a bit larger (at least for the rice and beans, which are pretty cheap). However, the meal was good enough to make it worth the price anyways. 

I'll definitely be back to try the rest of the menu."
Como En Casa	5	2020-02-21	Super friendly staff, if i could give it ten stars I would. Amazing food great atmosphere. There isn't a bad thing I could say about this place one of my favourite restaurants!
Como En Casa	1	2019-02-08	$16 dollars for the worst burrito bowl/platter ever, are you friggin kidding me. Maybe because it was take out but that's hardly an excuse. The portion size is just pathetic, and the chicken was pretty dry even though it was fairly flavorful. It's not value for the money at all, highly disappointing. Go look at the photo and tell me if that's worth it. At least try a little.
Como En Casa	5	2019-03-26	"When the urge for Mexican strikes there is not much in this world that can keep me from finding some.

We ended up giving this place a shot mainly due to proximity to where we were and I must say, we are so lucky to live in a city with so many options like this.

Though I wouldn't have called my mean authentic it definitely tasted great! 

The food was more american-mexican style, portions were generous and the ambiance was mexi-fun with random southern trinkets strewn about the place in a dimly -but not too dimly- lit location.

It has the usual items you would expect to find in this kind of restaurant with their own twists, flavors and sauces that I myself think we're too notch.

Though the place was a little small (it's Toronto, what can you do) it never felt cramped and we had more than enough space to eat and chill.

Once we left I felt stuffed which is #1 most important for me and even then we were already planning our next trip here.

If you are in the mood for mexi-american fare, look no further and give this joint a try the next time that Mexican urge comes-a-knockin"
Como En Casa	4	2019-01-27	"Very friendly staff, authentic food, but I ordered the wrong thing. Asked the server his favourite meal and he told me the enchiladas. I love Mexican food but enchiladas have never been my favourite - but I took him up on it anyways. The chicken enchiladas were good but not amazing - I should have stuck with my go-tos of fish tacos or a burrito (both looked great). 

Good portions. My gf asked for a rum and coke but the only hard liquor they have is tequila which is understandable but also inconvenient. Also the chair was not very comfortable. All that being said, I will definitely be going back!"
Como En Casa	5	2019-01-26	"This is probably the most legit Mexican restaurant in all of Toronto. Arguably the best burritos. Outstanding chicken mole. Great pozzole. Nice, kind hosts. Often, you will be served by the owners. 

Yeah, I go there a lot..."
Como En Casa	2	2019-08-27	"I took the advice of one of the reviewers on Yelp & I got the hybrid burrito.  Boy was I disappointed.  I thought the flavours were sooo bland & the burrito itself was rice heavy & lacked sufficient amount of meat. Seriously I didn't even want to finish it.

Also it seemed like (from the pics on here) that this was a take out place, but it's not.  It's all table service.  

I just think this restaurant did not hold a candle to restaurants in the same price range.  In other words, it was ridiculously over-priced for what you get.  The burrito alone was around $15."
Como En Casa	2	2018-03-27	"Two words can summarize my thoughts on the food here: overpriced and bland. I was super stoked to try Como En Casa because (1) I LOVE Mexican food and (2) fellow Yelpers have given this place such glowing reviews. We placed a takeout order on a Friday night. I ordered a small chicken burrito and my husband ordered a large verde burrito with beef. When I called and placed the order on the phone, the person asked me ""if guacamole was okay"". I said yes. To my chagrin, the guacamole was an extra charge, and we ended up paying nearly $30 for two burritos. I recognize that it's partly my fault for not checking if guacamole was extra, but I thought the way that I was asked suggested it was included, and they were asking if I wanted it on my burrito. Just seemed kind of slimy, if you ask me. 

All of this (including the high-ish price tag) would have been fine if I enjoyed my burrito. Negative. The meat was incredibly dry and bland. I barely had any chicken in my burrito, and if I did manage to snag some meat, it tasted like chewy old chicken. The burrito was mostly rice with, like, one piece of lettuce. I barely tasted a tomato or anything to break up the rice. I didn't notice any beans or sour cream. Honestly, this was a terrible burrito. I think I'm pretty easy to impress with Mexican food, but this was just horrible. My husband didn't like his either. I won't be wasting my precious Friday-night cheat meal on this place."
Como En Casa	2	2019-07-05	"Based on the ratings and reviews I was very excited to check this place out. I ordered a ""large chicken burrito"" which cost 14$. I got a really authentic vibe when I walked in. However, the burrito was one of the cheapest ones I've ever eaten. I asked for guacamole.... no guacamole. It was majority lettuce, rice, and bread from the overlapped wrap. Had to search just to find any chicken, very minimal. It was very dry, barely any sauce. Cheese was not good quality. All flavours were very bland. Extremely disappointing, for $14 I expect at minimum good size/quantity but didn't even get that."
Mexico Lindo	5	2020-05-13	"support local businesses, practice physical distancing, and wash your hands!!

OVERALL: 5/5
SERVICE: 5/5
FOOD: 5/5

this was incredible!!  my first time having mexican food not from a franchise. the portions were huuuge lol, i could probably order one meal for two people. & it tastes wonderful. i was worried everything would be too salty, but it wasn't! yay!

at this time (covid-19), they are offering takeout or delivery. i placed my order through ubereats.

CHIMICHANGA: this was my favourite thing i ordered from them. fried to perfection. i ordered it vegetarian, and it had corn, peppers, zucchini, i don't remember the rest lol. but wow! & it comes with three sauces, i loved it paired with sour cream

QUESADILLA: a bit on the salty side, but that is as expected with the cheese haha. again, ordered it as a veggie, i think same toppings as the chimichanga

SIDES (BEANS, SALAD, RICE): each order came with a all three sides! my favourite side was definitely the salad. it was soooo good haha

CHURROS: oh these were fried to perfection, coated evenly, and the sauces were great!! great sweet to finish off the meal"
Mexico Lindo	5	2020-02-23	"Ordered for the first time but I've heard so many great things about this place...
WOW
The portions are huge! Very hearty and fresh.
Everything stayed perfectly hot and ready.

The chicken was so tender and flavourful. 

I'll definitely have to get other things from the menu!"
Mexico Lindo	4	2019-12-09	"Close to home and family run mexican restaurant that's serving the classics, empanadas, taquitos, chinichangas and more.
The place isn't fancy but the food is definitely pure comfort. 
Prices are reasonable and the service is friendly 
I've had their chalice of Horchata a refreshing almond based cinnamon, nutmeg drink that's my go to. For food I've shared their Cancun soup along with their chorizo and pork chimichangas which you can't say no to"
Mexico Lindo	4	2020-06-03	This is one family owned restaurant I love to go. Food are very good. Place is tiny but always have a seat!
Mexico Lindo	4	2020-01-11	Passing by this plaza so many times and finally decided to dropped by. I heard about this authentic Mexican food from my friends. Oh yes! The food is amazing, the serving is huge that u can't finish the combo chicken Ensenada and beef chimichanga with rice, beans and salad. I loved the homemade drinks. The guacamole is for life. Lots of parking. Friendly staff.
Mexico Lindo	4	2019-04-15	"I have driven by this plaza several times, yet I never noticed this small Mexican restaurant until a friend suggested it.

There are only a handful of tables and I noticed they do a lot of take-out orders.  The menus are on chalkboards so it is very easy to read.  We ordered at the cash register, and then found a seat.  We were given complimentary tortilla chips and homemade salsa, which was a nice start.  We ordered two of the Mexican Combos, which consists of one beef chimichanga, one chicken enchilada, rice, salad and beans.  The food was very authentic and fresh.  I thought the beef would have been chunks rather than ground beef though.  My bad for not asking.  

The real star of the meal for me was the horchata.  I have not had once since our vacation in Mexico.  The drink was refreshing, delicious, and very creamy, with the right balance of rice, almonds, various milks and cinnamon.  It is very filling though!  I would definitely order it again.  

I was beyond full, but being a dessert lover, I had to try the caramel flan.  I should have taken it to go, but it looked so delicious.  Mexico Lindo's version is quite different.  The flan is very firm, not jiggly wiggly, and big on flavor!  My husband had only one bite, which is just as well.  I managed to finish it all by myself.

The owner came over and chatted with us, and it is nice to see a family put so much passion into what they do.  

Mexican Combo - $11.95
Horachata - $3.50
Caramel Flan - $6.00"
Mexico Lindo	5	2019-04-18	"An unassuming little spot in a strip mall known for some great food, and this Mexician restaurant is right at home with its neighbors. 

We had the chorizo burrito, pulled pork chimichanga, and a horacha to wash it all down. The burrito came wrapped simply but was toasted to perfection and carried the perfect balance of meat, rice, beans and veggies. It was absolutely delicious and we wolfed it down even before the second dish showed up. I bit into the pulled pork chimichanga and wondered what was so impossibly creamy..... and I turned out to be the melt in the mouth pulled pork. So delicious.

Excellent service and friendly staff. They found it amusing that I was so happy to get my goblet of horchata and promptly got us everything we needed to enjoy our meal. A lovely neighbourhood gem."
Mexico Lindo	5	2019-01-29	"The initial plan was to go to a nearby restaurant but got the ""we nuh have dat"". 

That said I am shocked that I have not been to Mexico Lindo before, my new benchmark for Mexican food in Scarborough. 

Clean environment, adequate space for dining in. None of the over the top decor stuff, the menu was straight forward. 

Tried their combo with Chicken chimichanga & enchiladas. Refried beans, rice, salad, and sauce !! Overall the food was flavorful, to make it simple. Portion size was good, in the addition the complimentary nachos was nice. 

Make it straight forward would recommend and would go again. Beats getting a naked burrito elsewhere, plus there is a variety of options to choose from.  

5/5"
Mexico Lindo	5	2020-03-15	I heard about this place and have been putting off trying it. Then I watched Ugly Delicious S1 S2 and HAD to have tacos! Dropped in and ordered 5 al pastor tacos to go and boy, I was not disappointed! Reminded me of being back in Mexico eating street tacos! So delicious! Highly recommended! Couldn't stop eating long enough to take pics lol! I'll be back!
Mexico Lindo	4	2019-03-12	Been meaning to try this place. Finally did. Next door to a childhood favourite of mine (Hunter's; greek food). Welcome addition to the plaza. Good bang for your buck and one of the better Mexican spots in Scarborough. I do think their spicy salsa could do with a bit more spice / kick though.
Mexico Lindo	2	2018-06-06	"This place has been bookmarked for awhile and I finally had the chance to try out this local restaurant located in Scarborough. This is a takeout and dine in restaurant - very casual.

After ordering at the counter, they offer complimentary chips and salsa. The salsa was so thin and watered down - no flavour whatsoever. I would have rather opted to not have it at all. 

I ordered the Chorizo Quesadilla which comes with beans, rice and salad. There are two sauces on dish but both were bland and lacking any taste. My sister ordered the Chicken Burrito which comes with the same sides, again it was bland and quite disappointing. I'm flabbergasted as to how this place has 4/5 stars when there are other places that taste so much better. Maybe it was an off day but this is not my first time having Mexican food. 

Sure the price is on point and portion is decent but quality and taste needs improvement. 

I'm sorry but I will not be returning."
Mexico Lindo	5	2018-10-03	"Love the authentic Mexican food here!  Had tried all their dishes, I keep coming back.  My favourite on the menu are the cactus which is hard to find anywhere else in Toronto (it might be a bit spicy for some, they don't have non-spicy option when I asked).

Note the limited seating area which is close to the door.  For this reason I usually only come here when the weather is good (not too hot and not too cold).  Can also do take out but it's best to eat in while it's still fresh."
Mexico Lindo	5	2019-06-05	Amazing chicken enchilada ! The food was extremely filling and couldn't finish my plate so I had to take it home! Very good Mexican food ! Would recommend !
Mexico Lindo	5	2019-11-09	First time trying authentic Mexican food. Place is located in a small rundown plaza at Birchmount & Huntingwood. Staff is friendly and good service! I ordered Mexican Chicken & Beef Enchiladas with rice/salad. I forgot to take picture . Love the food ! Will definitely go back to try other dishes.
Mexico Lindo	4	2017-03-26	"Growing up my view of Mexican food was limited by Taco Bell's interpretation of Mexican food...Hard and soft tacos, bean burritos and anything else off the value menu.  Yes, I admit it I had a very deprived childhood!

Mexico Lindo is located in a great foodie plaza at Birchmount and Hungtingwood.  To clarify there's a bunch of other places called Mexico Lindo throughout the GTA but I'm not sure if they are all related in anyway as the set ups all look different.  Its a bit of a dive but let's admit it, some of the best food are not found in super expensive places but the most ghetto dives around.  

Serving authentic and delicious fare from burritos, enchiladas, tacos, etc.. its a great gem of Mexican food in the part of the city where good Latin food is really hard to find.  Portions are large and prices are reasonable with prices from $10-$15 per entree and burritos around $8.

The place is more of a take out place but there are a few tables for a sit down meal.

No need to ""run for the border"" to get a good Mexican meal especially if Trump gets his way building that darn wall:).  A solid 4/5 from me!"
Mexico Lindo	4	2017-03-15	"Mexico Lindo is run by a family that is actually from Mexico: son takes the orders (he's a little slow), sweet daughter is at the register and mama runs the kitchen. Everything is cooked up fresh so there's a bit of a wait; the regulars know this so they call in their orders ahead of time. 

Wouldn't recommend eating in when it's cold because the dining room is drafty, best to stand next to their rotating heater (see pic) while you wait for your take out order.

Tried one each of all the tacos with everything on it. There was ground beef, chicken, chorizo, shrimp, fish and steak (they charge extra for the last three); my favorites were definitely the shrimp and the fish. Orders come with complimentary tortilla chips made fresh in house delish! If you are lucky enough to come on a day they make their caramel flan, grab it!!! The flan is dense, rich and utterly sinful. 

Definitely coming back to try their mole sauce, guacamole, calamari, nopales (cactus), pozole sizzling fajitas, deep fried ice cream and sopapillas.

Still on the hunt though for some authentic carne asada, carnitas, lengua (tongue), cabeza (head) and some home made tamales. If you know of any places hit me up!

Hasta la vista baby, I'll be back!"
Mexico Lindo	4	2019-02-04	I always wanted to go here coz it's near Chris' jerk. Hole in the wall about 14 seats and family owned. Have to order at the cashier then take your seat. There was about 10 customers including me and my wife. But there was a lot of pick up and skip the dishes coming thru. We ordered Chorinachos and sizzling fajitas. Once we got the Chorinachos we decided to take the fajitas home. It was a good amount of nachos and meat and it was delicious. We had the fajitas for dinner and it was amazing for take out. The take out container is so nice not ur average container everything separated. The service was very friendly and didn't wait too long. Can't wait to go back and try different dishes, pretty much wanna eat all what's in the menu. I can't emphasize enough how friendly the service was.
Mexico Lindo	4	2018-06-08	"I've had Mexico Lindo bookmarked for quite some time now, and I have to say that I'm really satisfied with my first visit at this family run business.

To put it simply, if you're looking for fresh and authentic Mexican food in Scarborough, than I would highly suggest trying this place out.

I ordered the Mexican Combo which kinda gives you a sample of things like chicken enchilada, beef chimichanga, rice and beans.  You also get complementary nachos and salsa which was a nice touch before the main food.

Afterwards, I ordered their churros which was really good! You only get 3 of them with caramel, chocolate and a raspberry sauce on the side. 

It is a very small place so i wouldn't recommend coming in a big group. It's probably best for take out or for 2/3 people. I'll definitely be coming back again in the near future to try some of their other food out!"
Mexico Lindo	5	2019-03-09	Amazing!! Family run, authentic, delicious food, competitive pricing and great portions! Love that they offer courtesy chips and homemade salsa! They earned our business and we will definitely be returning. Mexitaco has lost our business. Overpriced and portions are a rip off. This is way better! You won't regret it!
Mexico Lindo	4	2018-05-05	"If your looking for good authentic Mexican food and your in Scarborough you gotta to to Mexico lindo. It's my go to place for Mexican I can finally say I found a legit place in my area to get Mexican food. I have been here many times and not one bad experience at all. 

If you want to try a little bit of everything I recommend the Mexican combo it comes with chimichanga, enchiladas. I usually get the tacos each order comes with three and we can choose between beef, chicken, chorizo, vegetable and pull pork, you can mix and match. You can also choose hard or soft taco with corn or flour tacos. Everything comes with rice, beans and salad. Very good value.

There not much tables so you might need to take out. Very friendly family owned restaurant. You should give it a try!"
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos	5	2020-04-22	"I never fully understood the taco genre but my life changed when I had the Baja fish taco. Best taco I've ever had in my life. I think of it often. 

I also had the Pulpo a la Mexicana (octopus), which was also good but I definitely don't love eating octopus in a taco. Biting into a taco with crispy fish is just more satisfying than something chewy, y'know?

A warning to those who are visiting for the first time, there is almost no sitting room in this place so be prepared to bring your tacos elsewhere to eat.

Love this place."
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos	1	2020-05-24	"Ok, so I know this place is all the rage. 

I ordered the grilled beef for corona takeaway and I was disgusted. There was more fat, cartilage and inedible pieces than beef. Chew chew CRUNCH - spit. Over and over. My friend called me two hours later after ordering the same thing - she ended up giving her order to the homeless after the first bite. 

This means that they either don't clean (cut the meat) properly, or using cheaper pieces to save a buck. 

The grilled chicken was dry too. Honestly though, the shrimp was good. Stick to pulled beef and chicken for authenticity and - TEXTURE. C'mon seven lives!

Very disappointed."
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos	3	2020-04-20	"This place is a small hole in the wall and worth visiting if you crave some good old fashioned tacos rather than the commercial stuff.. portion sizes were good however the flavours were slightly missing for me.. 

I would visit them again if I was in the area, but not necessarily my go to place. Please don't let my review deter you from trying their tacos though, they are still pretty good. 

Flavours can be very subjective and this place is definitely worth a try.. but if you know and love tacos and taco culture as much as me, then you would also know that everyone has their own go to spot.. 

This place has great service, friendly staff and a small seating area if you just want to eat quickly or grab'n'go."
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos	4	2020-02-16	"CASH ONLY!!! & the location is kind of odd and the place is super tiny! But through it all the tacos are delicious....

All tacos are 6 bucks each. 

I ordered 2 tacos and was super full! I got the smoked marlin taco and the camarones a la diabla.

The camarones a la diabla was so fire!!! All the flavors were perfect. The marlin taco was not bad but a little on the drier side. Def would recommend the camarones a la diabla!

I tried the HOT salsa - and I like spicy but this was reallllly spicy! Good flavor tho but just an FYI for those daring souls.

I did not like that they didn't have small cups for salsa and you had to put your salsa straight on your taco. It's some what unsanitary from my perspective."
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos	4	2020-01-21	"Came here before during my visit in Toronto and really enjoyed this place. There isn't much room to sit or eat, but they give you sauces and likes for your tacos. 
Food -
Cabeza : very tender meat and lots of sauce. Would definitely get it again.
The fish taco I had here was very good as well. 
The prices here are a little much but the quality of the food makes up for it. Definitely worth coming for a bite."
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos	4	2020-01-30	"Knowing where to get the best tacos in town is serious business. As it stands, the best tacos that I have ever eaten have been at Tacofino in Tofino and Tres Carnales Taquería in Edmonton. After reading that Seven Lives was voted #1 Best Taco 2018 by NOW Toronto, named in National Geographic magazine's Places of a Lifetime article, and called #1 Best Fish Taco and #1 Best Tacos by blogTO... They seemed like a sure bet.

You'll find Seven Lives located in Kensington Market, one of the most eclectic corners of the city which suits them well. I visited the tiny shop on a Friday evening, prior to their early closing time of 7pm. They're definitely more of a lunch or early dinner type of place. It should also be noted that they accept cash only, so come prepared!

The tiny shop is bustling and exciting, buzzing with taco energy. The bright walls and giant sign that reads ""TACOS"" sets the vibe perfectly. I also appreciate their logo of a cat with a fish in its mouth - and the insinuation that this cat is down to seven lives, having already lost two. There is one table that can seat about four people and then there's a little bit of standing-room-only counter space. This makes things a little bit awkward if you plan to eat-in, as I did. The table wasn't available and so I stood at the counter in front of the window to eat instead. Which was fine. But certainly not ideal.

The menu is fairly straight forward, including nine types of tacos, some sides, and some beverages. Your order is placed at the counter with a friendly staff member and they call out your name once the food is ready.

Starting with something to drink, I was happy to see Agua de Jamaica on the menu. I always prefer an agua fresca when visiting a Mexican establishment, although I was also happy to see that Jarritos Mexican sodas are also on offer. (Their cola is my personal favourite of all of the colas.) Agua de Jamaica, otherwise known as ""hibiscus water"" is a beverage that exists in several cultures. In Southeast Asia it is known as Rosella tea and it's basically the same thing. Tart and sweet, this refreshing drink was a perfect accompaniment to the food.

We decided to get a Side as a bit of an appetizer. Tortilla Chips (Made fresh! - $3.00) and Guacamole ($3.00 for small) seemed like the way to go. I was a bit surprised that the guacamole didn't just come with tortilla chips and that both items had to be purchased separately. However, I did enjoy the homemade nature of the chips and that a heaping amount of them are tossed into a brown paper bag and given to you. I'll take a bag of chips any day. Golden and ultra crispy, these tortilla chips are exactly what I wanted them to be. They were seasoned really nicely as well. The guacamole was fresh and bright, with a great acidic kick to it. Obviously chips and guac are a match made in heaven.

Next it was time for the big show: the TACOS. Of the nine tacos available, two of them (the Adobada and the Carnitas) were already sold out. On the plus side, I probably wouldn't have ordered either of these anyway. Although, I must say that this did not leave much for meat options. There were four fish/seafood tacos, one beef and one chicken option, and a vegetarian. Nothing for pork at all. But again, I did not mind at all because I was going full ocean food - it's what they specialize in, after all.

Baja Fish ($6.00) and Gobernador ($6.00) were the ones for me. I loved the little condiments bar to the left of the counter that featured three different salsas (hot habanero, medium tomatillo, mild guajillo) as well as chili oil with sesame, and a bowl of sliced limes. This makes it very easy to customize your tacos to your preferred specifications and to control the amount of heat that you desire.

The tacos did not take very long and before I knew it, a green plastic basket was placed in my hands. The tacos were certainly vibrant and demanding to be eaten.

I began with the Gobernador (smoked marlin, shrimp & cheese). If Seven Lives has a signature taco, this is the one. Their front window even says ""home of the Gobernador"" right on it. I definitely loved the smokiness from the marlin the most, while the shrimp filled out the taco and added more texture. Everything had been grilled up deliciously. The pickled onion brought a great hit of balancing flavour and I liked the fresh tortillas a lot.

Next I had the Baja Fish (fried haddock). The first thing that I noticed is how generous the portion of fish is! The haddock was big, juicy and fried to perfection. The rest of the taco was kept very fresh with cabbage and fresh homemade salsa on top.

Both tacos were packed full and were pretty messy to eat, but in the best possible way. I liked both tacos but found them to be missing something that I can't quite put my finger on. I guess that I was hoping for something even bigger and more unexpected in terms of flavour. They were good... Just not the best that I've ever had.

I was also very impressed to see a C"
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos	4	2019-12-08	"We were extremely excited to try this taco spot during our stay in Toronto. Unfortunately, everything was sold out when we arrived the first day. Lucky for us, we were there for the first ""Pedestrian Sunday"" of the year. The street is closed off and many restaurants bring their business on the streets with stands. 

The tacos were a lot bigger than I imagined! They're a little on the pricier side but so worth it. They also have four sauces on the side with different spice levels - mild, medium, hot and Mexican hot. 

Cash only spot, please come prepared!"
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos	5	2019-11-25	"Wow, the most intense tacos I've ever had! Don't go expecting to have a sit down meal and please do yourself a favour and don't go on a date here because you will get messy. I promise you it's all worth it.

Wait in line and order at the cash, wait for your tacos and hope there's a seat. We were there at 3pm on a Saturday and we managed to squeeze in at the bar table. You can always take out but I think dining there is also part of the experience. 

The tacos are massive! I thought 2 wouldn't be enough but it was more than enough. They also have many different hot sauces you can add. Never have I eaten tacos with a fork but trust me, these are very big and I had to eat half the inside before I was able to somewhat grab them.

I believe they're opening a larger location across the street, I think it's much needed to keep up with the demand!"
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos	5	2019-10-24	"My cousin loves this taco place and highly recommended us to come here for our 2nd food adventure. We ordered the octopus taco and the grilled swordfish taco. Each taco was able $6ish, which is really pricey for a taco. I am used to getting tacos for $3-4ish in San Francisco, so these $6ish tacos better be delicious.

Octopus taco (5/5) - For any octopus lovers here, I highly recommend this taco. I've never had octopus tacos before and this was super delicious. You know that the octopus is fresh when you see an employee pulling the octopus with a large strainer out of a bucket. 

Grilled swordfish taco (5/5) - I don't eat swordfish often, but when I took a bite of this taco, I thought the fish tasted like meat. This was pretty good too.

This shop is really small. They provide different levels of hot sauce on the counter, along with some wet wipes. This place is CASH ONLY, so make sure to bring enough cash. The tacos are on the pricier end, but definitely worth it!"
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos	4	2019-12-07	"I always had this place tucked away in my Yelp bookmarks but never made it until now. I dropped by with a friend for a snack after Christmas Market and it definitely lived up to it's wonderful reviews!

The restaurant is in the heart of Kensington Market and is pretty small. Only one table that fits about 6 and a bar area where you could stand. I got Gobernador and it was SO GOOD. I feel like this was also enhanced by the fact that we were starving since we are directionally challenged and spent about 15 minutes getting lost before finding the place ...

They were very generous with the toppings, lots of cheese, shrimp, and marlin. Everything was enveloped by two taco shells the outer one was crispier and the inner was soft providing a nice contrast."
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos	5	2019-11-24	"When I tell you I have truly nothing bad to say about this place I truly mean it . This place is one of my favorite tacos and yes it's all the way in Canada !! These tacos taste so authentic, fresh and are made to order. We also got chips and salsa which was were tasty as well ! 
I tried the shrimp, carnitas and carne asada !! Believe it or not my favorite was the shrimp !! The sauce was incredible! Definitely a little messy but honestly just grab some chips and pick up what was left behind.
Loved this place !!"
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos	5	2019-11-23	"Special tacos are $6, which is more expensive than I am used to spending on tacos but you are also paying for unique, higher quality tacos. We had the Baja Fish and Carnitas tacos and they were delicious. Definitely a must-try place in Toronto.

Like many places in Kensington, the place is quite small and there aren't many seats. Be prepared to either stand at their standing tables or stand outside and eat. We stood at one of the standing tables which was fine because it doesn't take long to consume their delicious tacos."
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos	4	2019-09-21	"Visit: Saturday inthe 5 o'clock hour 

Atmosphere: small shop,minimal seating only one uneven bench and only uneven table lol busy but organized line moves at a decent pace 

Food: I got 2 tacos $6 each, all tacos are the same price. I got the fried haddock and the beef... the beef was so tender and literally melted in my mouth the sauce that they but on it paired well with it. The haddock wow what a large portion the fillet was bigger than my tortilla that never happens the tartar sauce was yummy and went great with the diced tomatoes. Both tacos were hot temperature wise and served fresh

I would recommend and I will go back next time I'm in the area to try the other combinations"
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos	4	2019-09-22	"Pros:
1. The shrimp & cheese taco (only 1 taco...) is delicious.
2. The taco finishes with a layer of cheese and pickled onion, quite guilty :) 
3. And a layer of meat at the bottom!

Cons:
1.long lineup 
2. $2 higher than other places in Kensington Market."
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos	5	2019-09-15	"All you want in a tacos street style stop! 

Small place, too crowded, mexican deco a bit modernized, not much place to eat....


But but but.  The best tacos i had in my life! 

Try the cabeza really amazing and a bit spicy
the carnita more classic but really good
And the pulpo a la mexicans was also amazing. 

A must stop in visiting Toronto"
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos	4	2019-09-25	"4 stars for taste
2 stars for price 
Which really should be a 3, but the meat is just so delicious. Coming from LA, I just don't think I can justify 6 CAD for ONE taco and one alone!! If you expect to be full, get ready to spend 20 CAD per person (and really that's like 3 tacos plus tax). 

With price aside, the taste is absolutely delicious. I tried the Pollo Asado and Carnitas- the chicken taco was so tender and the dressing was creamy, dressed with carrots. The carnitas was more no frills - meat with a salsa. 

There's a salsa bar on the side and limited seating, one bench table and the rest is counter space along the window."
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos	5	2019-09-01	"They have never let me down. Their tacos has consistently been the best I've had in Toronto. Always fresh, always delicious. I always bring visitors to this joint because it's such a good reflection of the food, culture, environment of Toronto. 

Tried their beef cheeks for the first time and my goodness, I don't know why it took me so long! It was absolutely heavenly. Definitely recommend!"
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos	5	2019-08-18	"I expected to experience a lot of exceptional food while in Toronto for a few days, but being from Southern California I most certainly did not expect to have one of the best contemporary tacos of my life. That's exactly what happened, and everything I thought I knew about Seafood tacos has been shaken. 

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?

Seven Lives is a somewhat cramped little shop that's cash only and is prone to both overheating and overcrowding in the Summer. Typically, that's a recipe for disaster as far as service and atmosphere are concerned, but the chaos builds on the hype a bit to be honest and it's all good in my mind given Seven Lives actually delivers on their widespread and now long-standing hype. Hunker down, have your cash ready, and you can expect your tacos in between ten and fifteen minutes after ordering. Until then just sit back and watch them work their magic. Star. 

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

$6.00 per taco is expensive, plain and simple even with a generous rate of exchange to the USD these days. Even so, the tacos at Seven Lives are at least two to even three times larger than your standard street taco and are jam packed with all sorts of different fillings, which makes the price point worth it. Star. 

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

For the purposes of emphasis, I'm going to set aside what was an exceptional Spicy Chicken taco in its own right just to focus in on the real prize here, which is and was the Gobernador taco. 

Smoked Marlin, Shrimp, Cheese, spices, house made fiery habanero sauce. This was so unexpected, so exceptional, so life-changing that I didn't even know what to do with myself. This was, I think it's fair to say, the very best seafood taco I've ever had in my entire life, and that's after having visited at least fifty or so seafood taco spots across the United States. Amazing. Two Stars. 

Star 5: Would you be excited to go back?

High Praise for Seven Lives. I read in an interview that at one point the chef had deliberated between opening a shop in Toronto versus Southern California - my vote goes to both. Star."
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos	5	2019-07-23	"These tacosssss. Hello. Still dreaming about them.

Is this a teeny tiny place? Yes. Is it extremely hot and muggy in here? Yes. Will you wait for a ridiculous amount of time in a lineup outside? Yes. BUT IT'S WORTH IT. Look, I'll wait all day for a good taco. I don't even care.

I tried the carnitas taco and the beef taco. Both were phenomenal and I'm just gonna make a bold statement - these were some of the best tacos I've ever had. The beef taco in particular was a stand out. The meat was so tender that it practically melted in my mouth, and the flavors were an absolute explosion of deliciousness. I love how they pile fresh cilantro on these babies. There's also a supplemental sauce station (in addition to what's already on the taco when it's handed to you), but I just went for a squeeze of fresh lime and that was all I needed.

Be aware that Seven Lives is cash only, but there's an ATM right across the street, so no worries there. Prepare to be amazed. This place is the one. Hallelujah, praise be to the taco gods."
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos	5	2019-09-06	"My friend recommended this place. I was a bit skeptical at first, since I just went to San Diego not long ago and ate a lot of good tacos. I gave it a shot when my boyfriend and I passed by Kensington market. Although a bit iffy at the $6 price, we decided the line was a good indicator that the tacos were good.

This place is cash only, and we waited in line for 20 minutes or so. The line moves fairly quickly. We got the fish taco and one of the shrimp tacos - the fish taco was definitely the best I've had. The shrimp one was also good, but not as good as the fish taco.

Really wish we ordered more!"
Hacienda las Américas	5	2020-01-25	Absolutely loved this restaurant. I can best describe the atmosphere as having a bite to eat in Tio's restaurant back home. The food was delicious and very authentic. The best thing about Toronto is all the diverse cultures that come with food, passion and their own stories. The staff were kind and helpful, we will definitely be returning!
Hacienda las Américas	3	2020-02-23	"3.5/5 
The food is alright and authentic, prices are reasonable for the area and the service is friendly. The guacamole is made fresh to order so that's always a plus! I ordered 3 different taco flavours (steak, pork and fish) and preferred the steak fajitas tacos the best as it was super juicy. Wish there was some type of small side that accompanied the meal."
Hacienda las Américas	3	2019-08-24	"Unfortunately, Hacienda las Americas didn't live up to the hype. My wife and I went here for dinner and got:
- Guacamole and chips: Guac was surprisingly bland and chips tasted store-bought.
- Sopes: This looked like a thick tortilla with lots of meat and veggies on it. It was 3 for $12, which we thought was a pretty good deal so got 6. The standout was the chorizo (super tasty and great bite). The chicken, beef suadero, beef sirloin, and beef tongue were pretty standard-to-good. The carnitas was too stringy and a little tough for me.

Maybe I'm in the (Yelp) minority and wasn't blown away with this place because I didn't get the tacos... but they were using the same meats for the tacos as the sopes, so I'm doubtful I'd have a different review. Worth a try once, but won't be back."
Hacienda las Américas	5	2019-08-19	"Some might this this is crazy, but these tacos are better than Seven Lives. Calm down, I wasn't sure if it would live up to the hype either, but this place exceeded every expectation that I could have.

Hacienda is located on College Street, very close to Sneaky Dees, in a bit of a tucked away, inconspicuous location. The interior is fantastic and the atmosphere is authentic.

There are a lot of reviews that knock this place for service, but that's not really the point of this restaurant. It's a family run place where the focus is food and soccer (when it's on) if you need something, you may need to call the serve over yourself, but that's no big deal cocerning the food.

The tacos are the best I've had in the City. At three tacos for $12, it's hard to go wrong. After reading some of the previous reviews, the beef tongue was an obvious choice. I'm not too big in beef personallty, but the meat was so tender and almost melted.

Next was the chorizo taco. It was fantastic. The chorizo wasn't overly salty like in a lot of other Mexican restaurants, which made a huge difference. The flavor was deep and rich, and paired perfectly with the salsa.

Lastly was the carnitas. It's hard to make carnitas as good as Seven Lives, but wow, these were something else. The carnitas were tender, juicy, and perfectly crispy.

The corn tortillas were also made in-house and were fresh and delocious. The servers also bring two sauces to the table - one salsa verde (green salsa) and one hot sauce. Both were great but be careful with the hot sauce, it's a heavy hitter! 

Pro tip: get a Mexican Coke, it's amazing!

Hacienda is the best taco place is the City. Seven Lives is a close second, but Hacienda has them beat in terms of authenticity and flavor.

Put this place on your go-to list, it will it dissapoint.

5/5"
Hacienda las Américas	2	2019-09-01	"Hacienda las Americas definitely doesn't live up to the scarce 4.5 star rating it possess on Yelp. The only redeeming factor at Hacienda las Americas were its sauces, which were hot, flavourful and added a nice kick to the entrees. But unfortunately the sauces are meant to compliment the entrees, not substitute them, and the entrees leave a lot to be desired.

I went here with my parents and I got the Carne Asada ($18) and them, the Alambre ($18). The Carne Asada is a steak + rice, beans and salad. The steak was extremely thin, tenderized to a point far from its original state, and couldn't have been more than 6oz. It was not a real steak by any meaning of its traditional definition. Worst of all, the steak was barely warm when it came to the table and it had a slightly foul taste to it and was definitely kept in the fridge a day or two too long. There was nothing in the dish that justified its $18 price point - whether that be the ingredients used, the skill put into making the dish or the quantity of the items. 

My parents got the Alambre (fajitas, rice and beans), which was really no better. Fajitas usually come in fresh out of the grill (sometimes a pan), sizzling, smokey and hot. There was none of that. The fajitas were warm, like the steak I ordered, and seemed more like a product of the microwave than a grill."
Hacienda las Américas	4	2019-08-24	I liked it! Came here for dinner with my hubby and we tried sopes for the first time. Sopes is like a taco, but the tortilla is much thicker, I think there's a base of mole sauce spread on it, and there's a lot more meat and veggies piled on. We got 6 different types and I'd say my favourite ones were the chorizo and carnitas (good call by the server who recommended this to us)! Also, it was 3 for $12 so came at a great price. The place is simple yet clean, location is convenient to get to (Bathurst and College, across Sneaky Dees), and the service is knowledgeable and prompt. If I'm in the mood for this type of food, I wouldn't hesitate to come back.
Hacienda las Américas	5	2019-11-13	"Finally, we hit the jackpot. An authentic Mexican restaurant in the Toronto area that serves excellent food, and is owned by true Mexicans, what a great concept.
We had the 3 taco combo; al Pastor, Sirloin and the Mole chicken. They were all excellent. Asked for the Mole to be extra hot, and wow, it tasted amazing. Can't wait to go back, try other things on the menu."
Hacienda las Américas	4	2018-03-17	"Delicious Mexican food - though to be frankly honest, this was my first try eating authentically Mexican food not associated with any chain. The server was very friendly and cute, and upon entering the restaurant, the first thing we noticed was that everyone there spoke Spanish! We stook out like a sore thumb.

My sister had crazy cravings for burritos, and so she ordered their burrito ($10). While she didn't have any choices for fillings, she was able to choose the protein choice and ultimately selected the beef fajita (flank steak). A massive brick sized, densely stuffed burrito soon arrived. It was filled with seasoned rice (omg the rice was so good by itself - I believe it had been cooked in some broth and so was unbelievably flavourful and umami), refried beans, fatty and crispy seared flank steak, cabbage, corns, tomatoes, etc. It was then topped with sour cream. The burrito was really filling but so delicious! My sister was stuffed by the end of it but couldn't help herself spooning lots in her mouth.

I was really craving soup, and was torn between the consome (lamb with chickpea soup) and pozole (a red pork soup with hominy). In the end, the server recommended pozole, and so I ordered that (even though it was a solid $5 more expensive). The soup came filled to the brim with pork, and some chicken, as well as hominy. It was my first time eating hominy, and found its dense mushy texture to be very interesting. Before I seasoned the soup with any of the provided garnishes, I found the soup to strongly resemble a Chinese pork and bean soup that we make often. 

The pozole came with limes, radishes, onions, spicy red peppers, some thyme bits, tortilla chips, and a green salsa verde. After adding the lime, onions, and salsa, the soup's flavours were all accentuated and enriched. It was absolutely delicious! I only wish that there were less hominies and more broth...

Overall, a very satisfying and deliciously authentic Mexican meal! Highly recommend."
Hacienda las Américas	4	2018-07-29	"For those looking for a more authentic Mexican meal in central TO, this is a great option! Decided to stop in here with a girlfriend for a late lunch and we were happy we did! We started with guc n chips which are a a must with any Mexican meal if you ask me. While the guc was fresh, it was missing salt and the chips didn't appear to be made in house which would have both lead to a 5 versus 4 star rating. I had never had beef tongue tacos so I had to give those a try, especially since my girlfriend who is Spanish highly recommend them and so did the server. Two sauces were offered to add to the tacos and those mixed together tasted excellent! No tongue taste haha :)
We also ordered Margaritas which were terrific! 
Service was friendly and fast. The prices were also great. I'll recommend the spot and would definitely return."
Hacienda las Américas	4	2018-02-28	"My top tacos place in Toronto now!  After having some killer authentic tacos in Chicago I've been lamenting my inability to find the same flavor closer to home. Hacienda las Americas has now saved the day!

You know that the food is gonna be good when you are served water in a Tequila bottle and even better that the fish tacos were on special that night! We got baja fish, al pastor, carnitas and beef tacos. Each was absolutely delicious and bursting with flavor. Basically you can do no wrong whatever you choose.

We warned that the place isn't fancy or upscale, more a local tacos joint that the neighborhood seems to hang out at. At one point some water started dripping onto our table from above. We weren't even phased, just switched tables and kept eating (they were that good)."
Hacienda las Américas	5	2019-08-28	I really enjoyed these Mexican dish called Alambre. This is basically beef mixed with green pepper and onions melted on cheese. The rice in the sopes were also very good fresh and tasty. I definitely recommend the restaurant to everyone in the community
Hacienda las Américas	5	2019-05-05	"As out of town visitors, we were trudging around in the rain hankering for some Mexican food and margaritas. Unfortunately, we didn't have a clue where to go. A quick perusal of Yelp led us to pick this spot. It's not much from the outside, but we were warmly greeted upon entering and quickly guided to a table.

Service was attentive even though we had a few language issues at first. Ordered margaritas (Tequila 1800 Reposado) and ordered our food. If you're in search of freshly prepared Mexican food that's authentic and well priced then you'll not go wrong here. This seems to be the spot for Mexican families (always a good sign!) and and our experience was delightful."
Hacienda las Américas	1	2019-10-25	"Food was awful - worst tacos I've had in my entire life - the meat tasted funky like it had gone bad and was burnt. The rice was bland with zero seasoning. They never even brought out the app we asked for (but they did try to charge us for it). I have no idea how this place has so many high ratings, the only positive is the food is cheap (although even at this price point it's not worth it). Even the mojito was subpar.

Stay home and make your own - it'll probably taste like a Michelin restaurant in comparison."
Hacienda las Américas	4	2019-09-10	Pretty chill Mexican place. We ordered the tacos from here. You get three for 12 bucks which is a pretty good deal, and they are pretty decent sized tacos. So far we've tried the pastor, carnitas, conchinita, beef tongue, chorizo, and asada tacos. I have to say my favs are prob the carnitas and conchintas. We also had the beans with chips but found the beans to be a bit watery, but still pretty tasty. Ambience is pretty chill, very colourful and feels like home style cooking. Also their two hot sauces are great.
Hacienda las Américas	4	2018-05-09	"Authentic Mexican food on College! Very unassuming decor and frontage, we nearly missed it the first time around. It's great for casual no frills Mexican food, and everything there is done pretty and old school (they take debit/credit, but they still write down your receipt old school). 

We tried the guacamole, 3 tacos, and the enchiladas. Guacamole had a good kick of lime in it, and the two salsas that it came with it were nice and brought lots of heat! Tacos were delicious, they use soft shell corn tortillas. We tried the pastor, beef sirloin, and beef tongue - my favourite was the pastor because it was more flavorful and had little chunks of pineapple in it. Enchiladas were soft and cheesy but definitely also had a lot of heat to it! 

Water is served in empty tequila bottles!"
Hacienda las Américas	4	2018-07-17	"Go here now! Never mind the usual tropes about ""authentic"" or hipster mexican... this place is just straight delicious. They had great El Pastor and Carnitas tacos as well as Enchildas and great homemade salsas for the chips!!!! I was so pleased I forgot to take pictures. It was also World Cup for added atmosphere.

Don't take my word for it. GOOOOOAAAALL!"
Hacienda las Américas	4	2019-02-10	This place is a little gem. The food here is delicious. I would say the prices are quite fair for authentic Mexican cuisine. I found it to be very flavourful. The owner of the restaurant is also very friendly.
Hacienda las Américas	4	2018-07-30	"$2.50 fish tacos, need I say more? I haven't really figured out if this is a constant special or if I've just gone in on all the right days, but the fish tacos here are delicious and don't break the bank. I personally haven't tried their other tacos, but my friends say that they're all amazing as well. Even at regular price, the tacos here are cheaper and debatably better than many of the hipster/trendy taco places downtown. 

The chips and guac is also very good. The chips didn't appear to be made in house, but they were still delicious. The portion size was pretty big and is great for sharing with a group. 

The owners and workers are very friendly and welcoming, and the place has a nice authentic vibe to it. Catchy Spanish music is constantly playing in the background, and they serve water out of tequila bottles as a nice added touch!"
Hacienda las Américas	2	2019-01-04	"I really want to write a nicer review for this place because the food is amazing. And $2.50 fish tacos cannot be beat. The sign advertising said fish tacos is what reeled us in. 

But the service was just abysmal. 

My husband and I were eating around Toronto, so we were ordering small plates everywhere we went so we could get the best of all worlds. We ordered their three for $10 tacos (chicken, pork, and beef) and an extra fish taco for $2.50. All the tacos were amazing, the pork being our favourite and the beef, although good, was our least favourite (it was a bit dry). However, the server seemed annoyed that the two of us were ordering so little. We weren't offered side plates to share the tacos, so they were dripping everywhere and we struggled not to make a mess. We were never offered any water and their sauces were very spicy. Thankfully we had our own. And the thing that irked me most was that we were overcharged $1.50 for our tacos. They write the receipts by hand and were originally charged $10 for the three tacos, but they scratched that out and wrote $11.50. Not a huge deal. I asked why we were overcharged and the server said it's because we mixed and matched our tacos. She was kind of rude when I asked. But all the other reviews seem like it's $10 for three tacos regardless of mixing them up. I think they were mad we took up a table and tried to make it up in other ways. I couldn't care less about $1.50, but I don't like shady business practices."
Hacienda las Américas	5	2018-08-26	Freaking delicious!!! We had the burritos al pastor and words really can't describe the feeling in my mouth. The rice was perfect and the meat was well marinated. I would highly recommend this place
Good Hombres	5	2020-02-13	"My favourite taco place period. Tacos are super cheap yet incredibly filling and delicious! The restaurant is much bigger now after renovations with an actual area in the back to sit down. Each table also has its own jar of pickled veggies and hot sauce! So cute, and I'm obsessed with the pickled vegetables!! So far I've tried the Barbacoa, pescado and both the chicken options, shrimp(it's a $1 more) and if I HAD to pick a fave, it would probs be  the chicken thigh and the fish! But seriously they're all extreamly tasty for such a low price!!! 

I'm already ready to go back and try the other tacos!! Ugh I wish this place was closer haha"
Good Hombres	3	2020-05-04	"After reading that they make their tortillas in- house, I was excited to come here for some tacos. For lunch, I ordered the chamberete (beef shank) and pescado (haddock). ""S"" on the menu indicates the taco is spicy. Since I have low heat/spice tolerance, I asked if they could make it mild. 

The tacos were smaller than other taco joints, but they are cheaper in price ($3.75 vs. $5-8). The tortilla was thin and soft yet it was still able to hold the filling/topping.

In terms of flavours and the protein, I didn't find it too memorable. The beef shank was a bit dry but the haddock was freshly fried.

Whilst sitting at the bar waiting for my food, I noticed that the staff worked like a well-oiled team!"
Good Hombres	4	2020-01-17	"After hearing many phenomenal reviews about Good Hombres, and having tried its sister restaurant Campechano, I felt very much obligated and drawn to trying this place! To my knowledge, they've recently begun taking reservations, so I placed one for a Thursday night. It's quite a long, narrow joint - upon walking in, you're met with a kitchen counter / bar for takeout and quick orders. To get to the main dining room, you pass through a small doorway. The vibe is also significantly different from Campechano; it's a far more casual vibe adorned with bright, colourful paintings.

To be honest, I was on the fence between 3 and 4 stars. On the one hand, I really did enjoy the tacos and they're objectively better than most places. On the other, I enjoyed Campechano much more, but gave that place 4 stars. In terms of cost / value, both place ended up costing me roughly the same, but I found Campechano to be far more satisfying (they have a double tortilla and have heftier, more generous fillings).

We ordered 10 tacos (for $3.95) each. I got the pescado (fish / haddock), champinones (mushrooms), camaron (shrimp) for my first round. For my second, I got a second pescado and added the barbacoa (lamb leg). My boyfriend got the carnitas (confit pork shoulder), pastor (pork butt), and barbacoa. For his second round, he got double carnitas - he just loved it that much!

Carnitas & Barbacoa
These tacos tasted identical to the ones I had at Campechano, so my review remains unchanged. The carnitas, being cooked in its own fat, is a very rich and hearty concoction. There's no real acidity, apart from the lime, to balance out the flavours - as such, it's a very pure, meaty delight. The barbacoa is seasoned and has more spices, and the meat is less 'tender and soft' compared to the pork (though objectively still very tender).

Pastor
The pork butt is definitely tougher and drier than the other meats, but still super flavourful. I particularly liked the addition of the pineapples - while it threw me off initially, I found that the fruitiness helped balance the textures and flavours. 

Pescado
There was a good chunk of fried haddock on the taco, topped with some pickles and spicy chipotle mayo. It was delicious - and so lightly battered! The flavour is a bit more muted than the meat tacos, but so satisfying. 

Champinones
This was the weakest one, I found - but still super fragrant and umami. The mushrooms didn't go as well with the tacos as the other options, but it's still very flavourful and far better than the poblano peppers I had at Campechano last time.

Camaron
I personally found this taco a bit difficult to eat; the small pieces of deep fried, brown shrimp bits often crumbled and threaten to cascade on my plate. That said, the flavours were delicious! I found them somewhat similar to the pescado (likely attributed to the common denominator of chipotle mayo), but the flavours were far richer and heartier. Definitely my favourite - and this is a slightly 'pricier' (though nonetheless not expensive) taco at $4.25. Well worth it!

Overall, I did thoroughly enjoy Good Hombres. The tacos are smaller than those at Campechano (maybe ~60% of the size?) but the flavours are the same. The service and ambiance is good. It's likely a nature of the tacos I chose (fish and shrimp), but I found there to be too much chipotle mayo. That said, I would definitely come again, and cannot wait for the opening of their third store!"
Good Hombres	5	2019-12-20	"Best tacos I've ever had in my life. Each of the 3 I tried (pescado, carne asada, pastor) had its own unique flavors and textures. The Pescado is a must try in my opinion. The fried batter on the fish is a perfect compliment to the sauces and often softer texture of tacos.

The guacamole was also excellent. Great for sharing.

The seating area is in the back of the shop, away from the take out section. The staff was very friendly.

Amazing restaurant. I live far but I hope to return one day!"
Good Hombres	4	2020-02-22	This place is delicious!! We came here on a Saturday evening and it was sooo packed. We got a seat at the bar since the wait for a table was approx. 40 minutes and we got to see first hand how hard the servers work. They were slammed with orders and running around nonstop but still delivered great service!! The food and drinks came out fairly quickly considering how busy they were. Highly recommend the pescado (my favourite), carnitas and chorizo. We also got horchatas to pair and the tres leches sponge cake for dessert. Great place for tacos, would def come back!
Good Hombres	5	2019-08-08	"Love this place!
Took awhile to get around to going, well worth it.
Both staff, nice and quick.
Pollo and carnita EXCELLENT."
Good Hombres	5	2019-07-20	"Fantastic Tacos! Softest Tortilla ever!
This joint was in my bookmarks for a long time, after drooling over the pics, reading rave reviews and countless check-ins by Martin S. 
Had the taco itch last evening, so decided to dive 60km to satisfy it. And boy, were we blown away!

Location- Good Hombres is located near Dundas/Bathurst intersection with a cheap parking close by at 400 Bathurst. Bus 505 stops at Dundas/Bathurst. So it is fairly accessible.

Service - It is a self service joint. You order at the counter; pay up and the food will be served by the cook extending the hand over the counter. It's fast and efficient. The cashier Sergio was friendly. 

Food - Food was the winner here. They had about 10 tacos available. We tried 6 of them. All were delicious. The tortilla was the softest we have ever had. We took half a kg bag of tortilla to go in a hope to recreate the magic at home, but weren't successful. 

Verdict - Just get off your ass and go! You won't regret it. Thanks Martin S."
Good Hombres	4	2020-01-22	Decided to check this out from Yelp recommendations. When I arrived inside the front door, was greeted right away by the super friendly staff. We proceeded in the back for dining in. The menu had a wide assortment of tacos to choose from, a couple drink options and guacamole. I ordered the quesadillas, the shrimp taco, carnitas and fish taco. Overall the taste of each of the tacos were great, loaded with flavor! The quesadillas was more different then your normal quesadillas, it was quite doughy but was oozing with cheese. I would definitely come back and would recommend to anyone who's looking for some quick tacos and a more quiet atmosphere.
Good Hombres	5	2019-05-22	"$3.75 tacos! You can't go wrong! This little hidden gem is situated right across from Toronto Western Hospital. You can find street parking for free nearby. The tacos are made fresh and tastes very authentic! The staff are nice and chatty and it's a great place to have nice a quick dinner. I came with my partner and we ordered 5 tacos, quesadilla, and an apple soda for $30. This was the best $30 spent on tacos. If you like tacos, I would rate this higher than seven live tacos in Kensington as it's cleaner, more spacious, service is quick and food is amazing. 

My favourite was the pescado (fish) and carnitas (pork). The fish was cooked perfectly with a crunch and topped with good sauce. The pork was also nicely seasoned and dressed. They offer extra hot oil which isn't spicy (subjective) but the tacos tastes great without it."
Good Hombres	4	2019-04-16	"This place is never open when we want to go - they take a small break in the middle of the day and close, and that's always when we've been in the area. (I personally hate when restaurants do this, and prefer either they are open straight through or take a long break dividing lunch and dinner..that's a discussion for another day) Finally we made it one Saturday! They are also closed Sundays ...

Place was empty when we walked in but within literally five minutes it was completely full. We shared the haddock, pork w pineapple and asked for recommendation for the third taco and the cashier suggested shredded chicken. I asked for no cilantro which was respected. Quesadillas weren't available which was disappointing. 

Seating is all bar style/backless - not a problem for me yet but may turn out to be as I become a larger-pregnant person. The tacos were a good size and worked well for sharing. they all had the same sauce on top so the flavour profiles weren't extremely varied. I found the additional toppings in the tacos a little boring - it was mostly meat, tortilla (which was quite good) and the sauce - for instance the haddock could have used a tangy addition besides the small lime wedge.

I would have given this three stars but hubby gave it five, so in Yelp fairness I averaged our experience out."
Good Hombres	5	2019-12-08	"Ended up going back today and buying tortillas for the first time from the store.

This deserves another 5/5 stars - it absolutely takes a homemade taco night to the next level. For just $10, we were given about 45 tortillas. It is portioned by weight, but it is generally about 20 - 24 tortillas for $5

The tortillas were made to order as soon as I walked in, and it only took about three minutes to make all of them.

Good Hombres is a great local business, so if you're even doing a homemade taco night, show them some love and grab some tortillas. It's cheaper than any grocery store, and the quality is substantially better

Enjoy!

5/5 Stars"
Good Hombres	4	2019-03-16	"I LOVE THIS PLACEEEE. The tacos are amazing. My favourite is the the haddock fish taco (Pesacado). I just wish the tacos were bigger for $3.75. But I'm for sure coming back. I went in 2 days in a row. And I will definitely go back again next week. I love the lime/lemon soda and apple soda. 

The atmosphere is great. Good amount of seating space. Unfortunately, paid parking at downtown Toronto (intersection: Bathurst and Dundas). 

The staffs are nice and welcoming. Pretty fast and efficient service."
Good Hombres	5	2019-09-28	"Heard about this spot from a friend, and boy do I love a good taco. Seven lives is just up the street- but I'm committed to giving new spots a fair try. All I can say- Delicious!!! Felt like I was back in Tulum having an authentic Mexican experience. Tacos are so yummy, fast (~3-4mins wait) , fresh (fish was just fried and melted in your moth), cheap ($3.75 per taco)- what more could you ask for ?

Why would I go to a pretentious king st taco resto after this when I know this place exists ?!? We will definitely be back."
Good Hombres	5	2018-12-05	"I love me some tacos where I don't need to wait/fight for a seat (for now because there is no way Good Hombres will stay a hidden gem for long).

Just off of Bathurst and Dundas, Good Hombres is off the main corner in a less populated part so traffic is slow. If you're unsure where it is, it's past the Vietnamese restaurant from Dundas, scross the Shoppers in West Toronto.

From start to finish, this small restaurant was perfection. We were greeted as entered, and felt so welcomed throughout the night. When I say restaurant, it's not one that serves you per se - you order at the cash, pay, and take a seat along the bar in front of the chefs. They'll serve you your tacos piping hot, always fresh and made to order. If i recall, there are only about 8 seats (maybe 10).

Thier menu is small, offering tacos ($3.75 each) and recently added, quesadillas. Between my boyfriend and I, we had 12 tacos but could've eaten more because they were so good.

Our top two contenders were Pollo Asada and Pescado. The Pollo Asada was light for a chicken taco, and the chicken was very juicy. The Pescado is fish, who doesn't like fish? The fish was thick, meaty and the toppings really complemented. Of the 6 I ate, 3 were Pescados.

The others we tried were Chiles Toreados - very pepper-y, Costillita de Res - delicious beef rib, and Tinga De Pollo - I don't really like pulled chicken so not for me. Overall, the flavours were all so different and so was the presentation, I was looking forward to each taco.

Highly recommend. Go now before it gets more popular!"
Good Hombres	5	2018-12-08	"Amazing tacos for cheap!

The tacos are tasty and the prices are great. I have no complaints regarding the food. 

Service:
Food was prepared quickly. Staff was welcoming and friendly. 

Ambience:
The environment is casual with simple decor. The store looks clean overall and it is quite spacious. However, there are limited seats available. 

Tacos:
The tacos are loaded with toppings and meat. For the price, the portions are very generous. They were all delicious but my absolute favorite taco was the pescado one. The fried haddock was delicious and the toppings on it went very well with the haddock.

Recommendations: 
Pescado
Costillitas de res"
Good Hombres	4	2019-08-24	"I came here with my friends the other day when we were looking for a cheap place to get dinner. We randomly found this place on yelp so we decided to give it a try and I'm so glad we did!! The tacos are DELICIOUS, and very cheap!! 

I ordered the pollo asado, carne asada and pescado tacos. Each one was made very well, but my favourite was definitely the pescado. 

The tacos were a bit small so keep that in mind if you're really hungry. But overall this is probably one of my new favourite spots and I will be returning!"
Good Hombres	5	2018-11-17	"Good Hombres serve elevated tacos that bring sentiments of great, authentic Mexican food. Prepared with care and attention, this delicious meal is perfectly true in every way. On the northwest side of Dundas and Bathurst (look for the TACOS TACOS TACOS window), there is a little mystic tortilla-making machine that sends fresh, perfectly perfect tortillas onto a conveyor belt - made on demand. 

When you enter the modern, casual, grab-and-go, airy taco joint, you're greeted by colours of blue and yellow, stainless steel, and bar seating that lines the spacious frontline kitchen where you see the magic happen. The taco menu is diverse but everything is delicious. $3.75 per taco. Order 4 if you're hungry, 2-3 for a snack. The only seating is by the kitchen where there are condiments of pickled vegetables and a delicious ""salsa macha"" from Veracruz which is prepared with oil, chili and garlic. It's absolutely divine when drizzled on the tacos.

Their staple tacos, illustrated on a hand-written chalkboard menu, are colourful, whimsical creations that tickle your palate in flavours that are true to the history of the Mexican tortilla, and are served on fun bright vibrant plates:

1. Pastor: PORK shoulder, salsa macha, pineapple

2. Carne Asada: STRIPLOIN, salsa verde (green sauce)

3. Pescado: HADDOCK, lettuce, chipotle

4. Pollo Asado: CHICKEN thighs, salsa macha

5. Tinga de Pollo: CHICKEN breast, tomato, chipotle

6. Rajas Poblanas: roast poblano PEPPERS (a mild chili pepper from Puebla, Mexico), cotija (a hard cow's milk cheese from Mexico)

7. Chiles Toreados: shishito PEPPERS (a sweet, East Asian variety), black beans, salsa roja (red sauce)

8. Costillitas de Res: BEEF short ribs, salsa roja

9. Lengua: TONGUE, salsa macha, salsa verde

We had the tacos with haddock, beef short ribs, chicken tinga and tongue, and they were all flavourful bursts of juicy deliciousness; light and carefully crafted that looked so much fun to eat. It tastes like lots of time, effort, and love were folded in as the main ingredients in this timeless, traditional Mexican dish. We wanted to try them all-and we most definitely will next time (and as much as our waistline allows!).

On the menu, there's also:
- Quesadillas: $6
- Drinks: $2-3
- Masa (dough made from corn flour; used to make tortillas): $10/kg
- Tortillas: $14/kg

As a downtown Toronto Yelper, Good Hombres is midway between Dundas and Ossington (hipster mecca) and Chinatown (dim-sum heaven) and across the street from Toronto Western Hospital. But more importantly, it's a new taqueria that is worth coming back time after time for authentic, juicy, flavourful tacos that are a joy to eat. -Tell them Will and Justin from Yelp sent you here and wear your stretchiest pants, your belly will thank you.

Good Hombres	4	2019-11-10	This place serves some really great tacos! Service is very quick as we got our food in a couple of minutes. We were seated at the bar and were able to see everything being made fresh. Everything was delicious and my favourite is the Pescado!
Good Hombres	5	2019-04-28	Hands down the most authentic tacos that you can possibly get in Toronto! The shells are made in house out of corn and are really soft and supple. Everything is made with love. Even the way the tacos were served was how they serve it in Mexico - on these colourful frisbees meant to be used as dishes. This place can get super crowded but that is only a testament as to how good their food is.
Good Hombres	5	2019-06-16	"Delicious, unpretentious tacos in a hidden gem of a restaurant. 

Ended up here after reading positive Yelp reviews. The tacos are delicious, well-balanced and inexpensive for the serving size. You're much better coming here for food alone, vs. going to the majority of Mexican tapas places in the city that are more for the ambience. 

Also, I ended up talking to some of the employees and I asked them about the name. It's derived from when Donald Trump accused Mexicans of being rapists, criminals, etc- a bunch of ""bad hombres"". Good on Good Hombres for putting some positive vibes out into the world.  

Please note, there is only bar seating here so it's not great for groups. More for quick eats."
El Trompo Taco Bar	5	2020-01-04	"We went here on a pretty, hot and sunny day so we opted to get seated outside. This cute Mexican cuisine place is so adorable. Their prices for food are fair and come in nice portions, their customer service is also very excellent, our server was so sweet.

The nachos were very good! The salsa was very flavourful and tasted really bright, totally recommend"
El Trompo Taco Bar	4	2019-09-18	"If there are three words that will get me into almost any dining establishment it is this ""Al Pastor Tacos"".

If nothing else, the value is great! Five tacos for ~$10 CAD is awesome. Maybe it's not that unusual, but a newcomer is allowed a little wiggle room, right?

Anyways, I ordered the Al Pastor Tacos (surprise surprise), and the Jamaica. While the tacos were small, this kept them from falling apart, and 5 was more than enough to fill me up, but not have me loosening my belt. 

The Jamaica kind of reminded me of homemade fruit compote. Not too sweet, and just the right amount of tart. Overall, the flavours were extremely well balanced. Due to the complexity of them, though, I'd say it was borderline refreshing. Though thesis not a bad thing. 

The tacos didn't shy away from their authenticity. Nothing fancy-shmancy, just the traditional protein, onion, cilantro, and the pineapple that comes with Al Pastor. The flavours were well balanced, without too much of one or another flavour. 

However, my gripe is that the pork was rather dry. They did provide two hot sauces, and a lime, and to be fair, they helped, but didn't solve the underlying problem. Furthermore, they lacked anything (this is where sauces and general moisture come in) to help tie the different flavours together.

Speaking of hot sauces: the red one was okay, and rather spicy. The green one though is rather undeveloped. I hate to say it, but it almost tastes like when I tried to make hot sauce by blending jalapeños and vinegar. 

The location has a cool vibe, and the service was very polite."
El Trompo Taco Bar	5	2020-05-18	I found this place as a suggestion from a friend. If you were to walk around its kind of hidden, but let me tell you one of the best taco I've had. The lady who took my order I believe was the owner and she was so sweet and genuine. I ordered Al Pastor tacos and they were fresh and ready quick. If you are in the area or looking for great tacos try them out and thank me later. Support local!
El Trompo Taco Bar	2	2019-05-20	"I'm very confused on the tacos we received vs all these amazing reviews...

First timers at Kensington so we decide on this taco joint because Seven Lives was too long around 1:30p. 5 small tacos come in an order and you can only mix and match Al Pastor, Tinga and Chorizo. So we decided to get 2 Tinga and 3 Al Pastor. The tacos literally came out in 2 minutes after ordering. Too quick :3 The taste was bland and unappealing.

I've just attributing this negative review to a bad day at El Trompo..."
El Trompo Taco Bar	3	2019-04-07	"El Trompo has always flown over my head - I've walked by a hundred times but never noticed it. I'm happy I finally did, because the tacos here are amazing! These tacos are more ""street"" than Seven Lives', but there's definitely a time and place for them

While the tacos here are great, I was incredibly disappointed that the chips + pico I ordered to start seemed to be store-bought tortilla chips - they reminded me of Tostitos. The pico was pre-made, and super cold out  of the fridge, another disappointment. Plus, service is spotty."
El Trompo Taco Bar	5	2019-10-19	Had a delicious breakfast in the sun with a great waitress and her cutest little helper. The breakfast along with some beef tongue tacos were amazing.
El Trompo Taco Bar	5	2020-05-28	It was fantastic, I got the signature taco and oh man it was so good. everything about it was amazing, the hot sauce on the side that they give out with your taco is really good also! I highly recommend this place!
El Trompo Taco Bar	4	2019-09-17	"Yum yum yum! This place is now at the top of my favorite Mexican places. While on a walking tour, our tour guide told us to try out El Trompo if we were hungry so that's exactly what we did. We didn't have to wait for a table but when we left there was a little line forming. 

I got the fish tacos and the house marg and DANG that was the best house margarita I have had in a very long time! The spicy mayo sauce on the tacos was amazing and the guacamole was out of this world!!! 

Highly recommend this place for some good food without all the fuss!"
El Trompo Taco Bar	4	2019-09-02	The long line ups here are worth the wait! We got some tacos today and really enjoyed how soft and slightly chewy the taco shells were with delicious chicken and tofu filling. I was pleasantly surprised with how filling and tasty the vegetarian option was, and wish I lived closer to this place so I can have lunch here every day! It's vegan friendly as well.
El Trompo Taco Bar	4	2018-10-23	"I've never eaten street tacos in Mexico, but El Trompo markets itself as offering exactly those and I imagine that they're not wrong in doing so. These are ""street"" in the way ""street"" should connote - quick and simple. They won't blow you away. In fact, the might not even impress you much. But if you're looking for tacos at a reasonable price, these will do the trick. I got the Al Pastor. I'm not a big pork guy, but that's what the menu recommends so I thought I'd give 'em a try. Not bad! None of the porky taste I generally shy away from, and the pineapple is a nice touch. I was worried they'd be dry based on looking at them, but the pineapple substituted nicely for what could've (should've?) been fat. I asked for a shot of their cheapest tequila, which apparently was $7. So not cheap exactly.

The truth is this place is underwhelming. There used to be a terrific place for tacos just down the street in a sort of makeshift food court, but it's since shut down. I give El Trompo 4 stars mostly because it's been there a while and I worry what might come after it. Kensington Market is a gem, and I'll be damned if it changes even more than it already has."
El Trompo Taco Bar	3	2019-05-26	"2.5 stars but rounds up to 3. Okay tacos but nothing special. Al pastor was dry and lacked flavor.  Service was friendly and very quick (tacos came in less than 3 minutes after ordering).  Frozen margs we're good, though. 

Tinga Tacos: 3/5
Al Pastor Tacos: 2/5
Mango Margarita: 4/5"
El Trompo Taco Bar	5	2020-03-04	I bring my favourite people here. The guac is the best!! Good vibe, the staff is friendly, good vegetarian options and traditional tacos and other dishes. Yummmmm
El Trompo Taco Bar	5	2018-09-05	"Just love el trompo
Our server was nice, and their frozen margarita was awesome!! Be sure to get their guac. Very chunky, and even though their tortilla chips were a little soggy, I blame it on humid summer we had. Tacos? Awesome. Grab a seat on the patio and it's great for people watching ;)"
El Trompo Taco Bar	4	2019-02-18	"If I'm in the mood for no frills authentic tacos, El Trompo is definitely my spot. They range from the classic Al Sador tacos, to a delicious vegetarian option with mushrooms. They also have delicious salsas for you to top your tacos with. While this is definitely not my number 1 taco place, it definitely easily makes the top 5. This is what I imagine at a local taco spot in Mexico!

I've also tried the molten lava cheese pots (cheese with onions, yes please), the cactus salad and the guac. The guac is absolutely delicious, with the tomato adding just the right amount of citrus. Cactus salad, is citrusy and refreshing, a perfect break in between bites of spicy tacos. It has a texture of a cooked squash, and definitely something to try.

If you're looking for an inexpensive, no frills taco spot, with extra offerings, definitely the perfect spot!"
El Trompo Taco Bar	5	2019-10-24	What a great place! Small place but all the food is amazing. Very authentic. Great tacos & sauces. Service is great! The guacamole was delicious, the salsas fresh & full of taste.
El Trompo Taco Bar	3	2019-07-09	Their margaritas are excellent but their tacos aren't as good as they used to be. They are very simple - which isn't a bad thing *if* the few ingredients used standout and are prepared well. The pork was dry and the overall taco was flat - it didn't have the bright acidic flavours or freshness that I love in a taco.  The fish was tender but the chipotle sauce was overwhelming and I couldn't taste much beyond that. The queso fundido with mushrooms and onions was delicious and flavourful - it reminded me of French Onion soup. This place used to have delicious tacos years ago- hopefully I feel the same way about it soon.
El Trompo Taco Bar	4	2019-08-09	Absolutely delicious! Went with a friend for lunch at sat on their cute and petite outdoor seating. Service was fast and friendly, the food was delicious and extremely fairly priced, and filled my friend and I both up. Be aware that any bill under $10 total needs to be cash- but anything over that they accept credit/debit. Tacos were delicious street style tacos, came out fast and tasty! Guacamole was about average, but still tasty. Would definitely come again sometime!
El Trompo Taco Bar	5	2020-01-02	Cozy little authentic Mexican restaurant. There was a quick five minute wait before we were seated. The restaurant was packed, but the service was quick, friendly and the tacos were delicious!
El Trompo Taco Bar	3	2019-12-21	Ordered 5 tacos with a mix of Tinga, Chorizo and Al Pastor. The tacos were shockingly small and costed $10 plus tax. Tinga and Chorizo were meh, kinda lacked flavors. Al Pastor was the most unique one of the 3 with the addition of pineapple. Hot sauces were good, one green and one red. Service was really nice.
El Trompo Taco Bar	5	2019-06-10	"Great food.   Very relaxing environment.  Price was very good as well.   
Really enjoyed the visit.  Service was super fast.  
Recommended."
Campechano Taquería	5	2020-03-18	"My God I am in love with this place ever since being introduced to it. Yes prices are a little higher but the quality and flavour is just amazing not to mention they really fill these babies! 

I definitely  recommend getting the ceviche, AAA ribeye taco its my favourite along with the fish taco and the braised lamb and why not finish off your meal with their $4 tres leches topped with fresh strawberries and a drizzle of strawberry coulis. I would be good with sharing the ceviche app and having two tacos for myself.

The decor is small and cozy, reservations ahead of time is highly recommended but they do leave a bit of space for walk ins.

They also own Good Hombres on Bathurst and Dundas and have even opened a 3rd location somewhere on College st. I just keep coming back to this location since its walking distance to me but will definitely be checking out the other places soon. Everyone knows this hot spot and if you haven't been yet, what are you waiting for? I promise you won't regret it!"
Campechano Taquería	4	2020-03-02	"Campechano Taqueria is tucked away inconspicuously at the corner of Adelaide/Portland. Inside you'll find a quiet, mellow and hip taqueria that makes for a great date spot or catch-up dinner with friends. I'd say that Campechano is distinct from other popular taquerias nearby such as Wilbur and Mi Taco in that it is a lot more of a sit-down place and not so much a take-out or eat-and-go type of place, so if you're looking for more of that vibe, Campechano is definitely for you.

Campechano's tacos are noticeably pricier than other taquieras nearby, and although tasty, I honestly found it hard to justify the extra cost. My buddy and I went for a taco crawl and we went to the two aforementioned taquerias and we both agreed that Campechano's tacos left quite a bit to be desired as the last taqueria in our crawl. Although most of the tacos come with avocado, which is often a premium ingredient, the meats were a bit too salty for our taste. I would even say that the barbacoa, made with braised lamb, was a little bit too chewey for my liking. Nonetheless, Campechano serves delicious tacos and provides a unique atmosphere and dining experience so it is definitely worth going to."
Campechano Taquería	4	2020-02-08	"Campechano is a great place for vegetarians and meat eaters alike. Their menu contains options for both and items are sold by piece, so everyone can order whatever they want.

Most tables start with the guacamole ($8) where it arrives with two cups brimming with thin crispy chips, which they refill if you finish the tortilla before the dips. The salsa roja is great, with just a bit of spice and plenty of zest. It leaves the guacamole feeling fairly neutral, jazzed up with pomegranate - an interesting twist, though personally I do enjoy my dip without fruit.

If you're feeling hungry than order a sencillo sopes ($6) for yourself; otherwise, it's hearty enough to share. The tortilla is thicker and soft, almost like naan but not oily. A layer of refried beans is spread on top with lettuce, cheese, and two types of sauce covering the pillowy tortilla. A different alternative to Campechano's tacos, but not nearly as exciting.

If you can handle spice, the hongo ahumado ($6) has a healthy kick of fiery sauce drizzled on top. This heat was unexpected as the taco's description made it sound earthy tasting, from the smoked mushroom base, with a hearty finish, thanks to the white bean puree. In reality, aside from the spice, it's rather fresh with plenty of herbs sprinkled over top and very tasty, despite all the water you'll have afterwards.

On the other hand, the healthy sprinkling of cotija cheese on the rajas ($5) makes the roasted poblano peppers taco richer than you'd expect. Additionally, the peppers aren't spicy at all, instead having a deep earthiness. With little bits of corn added for bite, this was another tasty taco.

Campechano's dining room is small and cozy, so try to make a reservation. Regardless, there seems to be plenty of walk-ins and on our weekday dinner visit, the wait wasn't long... their service is friendly and efficient so most tables turn over quickly."
Campechano Taquería	4	2019-08-09	"After hearing so much buzz about Campechano both online and among my colleagues, I was ecstatic to finally come here and give it a try. Though I had high expectations, I did not leave disappointed! The vibe of the small place was fantastic, and suffice it to say that the food really stood out (particularly the corn masa tortillas made in-house)!

I had a reservation for 6:30PM, and although there were still some seats when we arrived, there was a line by the time it was 7PM. After asking the server what was popular, my friend and I quickly ordered some tacos each. We shared the guac & chips, and both got the barbacoa (lamb leg with spicy guajillo and jalapeno) and carnitas (pulled pork shoulder with salsa verde), but she also got an additional vegetarian rajas (poblano peppers with cojita cheese).

Guac - It was super interesting to see the guac topped with pomegranate seeds, which added a beautiful pop of vibrant colour and burst of sweet flavour! The guac was good, the chips were delicious, but we adored the smoky dip that accompanied the duo.

Barbacoa - Came with huge and meaty chunks of tender lamb leg. I loved the gamey taste, though the creamy, spicy dressing was a little too heavy for me. That said, this was one of my favourites just because it was so comforting and filling!

Carnitas - Similar to the barbacoa, there were generous and copious amounts of confit pulled pork. Although this was dressed with only salsa verde, I found it to feel a little heavier - mostly because with every bite came a healthy gush of oil drizzling down my chin. It was definitely less spicy, and you could taste the different flavours more!

Rajas - I sampled one bite of my friend's, and found it to be an interesting combination of spicy and sweet (from the peppers). Though this was our least favourite, she did say that when she got to the centre, the melted cheese mixed with the sweet peppers and hot spices was a pretty good combination. 

After finishing, my friend and I thoroughly debriefed on our experiences, and our thoughts were:
- The masa tortillas were FANTASTIC. It was both soft and yielding, sturdy enough to hold all the fillings and sauces without being soggy.
- We really appreciated that the toppings/fillings were simple - my friend pointed out that the tacos didn't have any of the heavy, creamy aioli common at other establishments
- We would most definitely come again!!! Or try out the sister restaurant, Good Hombres :)"
Campechano Taquería	4	2019-07-15	"I love the vibe of this place. It feels very local and cozy but also cool and hip. If you're coming for dinner, consider making a reservation, it gets busy!

You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu and there are so many options to choose from! I ordered the Campechano, carnitas and fish tacos. All were delicious and had a good kick to them - just what I look for in a good taco. If you're not so great with spice, ask the servers to take it easy on the spice sauce.

The real star of the meal were the corn tortillas. You can tell that they are made in-house and are oh so fresh!"
Campechano Taquería	4	2019-09-02	Great food, love the casual patio vibe. Good, quick service and it is always busy! Cooking with a huge piece of fresh delicious fish. The Tinga has a nice guacamole and spicy sauce. Now I know why it's always busy when we walk by! Will visit again
Campechano Taquería	5	2020-02-22	Ignore the bad reviews and come try this place. As a Mexican and self proclaimed taco expert I'd eat these tacos religiously if i could. The guac is perfect and the salsa roja has the perfect kick.
Campechano Taquería	4	2019-06-26	"A great spot for some tacos!

Been meaning to go here for a while and after 1hr in Costco followed by the lovely prime time traffic back to King West it was time!!

Firstly, defo aim to go when its sunny and sit outside, the outdoor area is nice and if you can get in the little secluded section you may never leave.

On the tacos i had the Haddock Fish Taco, the Steak and Chorizo and the Chicken ones - I warn now do not be as greedy as me 3 of these tacos was too much of course i ate them but 2 is well enough.

The fish one was only ok but the Steak Taco was one of the best I have had...the chicken also is a treat so go for them 2.

All the ingredients felt fresh and each taco came with different toppings to compliment the meats which which they did perfectly!

Absolutely worth a go if your a taco fan, just don't be surprised when you accidentally spend over 100$

PS - The cocktails are unique and amazing, the Pina-Mojito is a must try ...hmmm maybe this is why i cleared 100$

PPS - Get chips and Guac, its good and free refills on the chips."
Campechano Taquería	5	2019-11-06	"Campechano has slowly become my favourite taco place in the city. The more I dine here the more I fall in love with the food, the decor, and the restaurant overall.

Fair warning though, I'm not the only one who loves Campechano! Make reservations in advance because the wait can be up to an hour sometimes without one. If you're looking to make reservations for a Friday or Saturday night, I recommend booking at least a week before.

The decor is simple and bright. Unlike other taco places, they don't dim their lights too much at night so you don't have to worry about squinting to see in front of you. The restaurant is quite small so it can feel a bit cramped when it gets busy, especially when you have to get up from the table. It's not too big of an issue when you're seated though! The servers are friendly and decently attentive, especially for a busy restaurant. Prices are fair when comparing to other sit-down taco places like La Carnita and El Catrin.

For starters, the chips and guacamole is a must-have. The guacamole is topped with a seasonal garnish. Last time I went it was pomegranate seeds, which gives it a nice sweet crunch. Their homemade chips are unlike your regular tortilla chips. They are so crispy and yummy, I would happily just come for the chips alone. They also offer refills of the chips, which makes them even more amazing!

The tacos are just as good as the guacamole. The tortilla (also homemade) for the tacos is so good and really ties every taco together nicely. I love the Carnitas (confit pork shoulder) and the Barbacoa (braised lamb leg). If you like spicy, the Pollo Al Pastor (chicken thigh) will set your mouth on fire! The fish taco is also quite good. It tastes fresh and is fried to perfection. It's a definite must for someone who doesn't like spice.

All in all, if you're a fan of tacos, Campechano is a must-try! You won't be disappointed!"
Campechano Taquería	5	2019-03-14	This place is still five stars, and all of my previous witty anecdotes (I'm supes humble) from my last review remain the same. However, it's worth noting if you come in right at 12noon you will beat the rush and the spice level in the Al Pastor is high. It's really high for a lil' lunch munch.
Campechano Taquería	5	2018-11-20	"I consider myself lucky and honored to live within a 2-min radius of this place.

Have been able to get seats on walking in on multiple occasions.

The tacos generally are large and filling and what I consider more on the ""gourmet"" side vs. traditional. Which is what makes them great. The fish and the barbacoa are stunning. The temptation is to order 3/person just to try all the different kinds, but 2/person is probably more reasonable.

Food comes to the table SUPER fast."
Campechano Taquería	3	2019-11-25	After many friends had recommended this place, I decided to try it. Honestly, it was pretty overrated. The tortillas weren't great, and the guac was just alright. Glad I tried it because the place is cool, but the food is pretty forgettable.
Campechano Taquería	4	2020-02-16	My girlfriend and I visited at 5:30 on a Saturday . We luckily were able to get a seat at the bar. This is definitely that place where a reservation is needed. People were being turned away due to reserved seating. On to the food... The guacamole was amazing.. The tacos were spicy! I love spicy food and I even thought some things were spicy, especially the shrimp.Aesthetic definitely a 10/10. Cool place, wouldn't eat here again though
Campechano Taquería	3	2018-08-04	"Delicious tacos, horrible sangria. 

Campechano and Seven Lions are the only two ""authentic"" tacos I've had in Toronto, as compared to tacos you can get in the US, particularly as you get close to the Mexican border. At $6-$8 each, they're not cheap, and you'll need between 2-4 to fill you up. 

Avoid the sangria - one of the worst I've had in Toronto."
Campechano Taquería	4	2019-01-20	"The restaurant takes reservations and were very accommodating when our group of 10 were late.  They waited 30 min for us to arrive when I gave them advanced notice of our tardiness.  The food and service were great.

The tacos and beer were very good.  I chose lamb and sirloin tacos.  I also got the seabass ceviche but it was a bit spicy for me.  Overall, it was a great time with the long table in the back room. I would definitely return."
Campechano Taquería	4	2018-06-20	"Tacos are by far one of my favourite things to eat. I love how messy it is, the toppings and the different meats. Tortilla's should be made fresh and in house and the meats have to be tender and juicy. 

I walked into Campechano not really knowing what to expect. It's a small causal taco spot on Adelaide and Portland, I honestly would have walked right past it. We sat in the back on the patio which I really liked. We decided to forgo the usual Guac and Chips starter and go straight for the Tacos. 

Service here is great. Each taco comes out as soon as it's made. I ordered the Carnitas, Chicken Thigh & Bisteca Tacos. The Bisteca was good, I really liked the sauce on top, the tortilla is fresh and definitely made in house - I wish the meat wasn't as chewy as it was but overall I liked it. The chicken thigh was good minus the thigh, there were a few fatty pieces but I ignored that because of the spicy pineapple topping. My favourite taco was the Carnitas. It had a delicious smoky flavour and the meat was perfectly cooked. 

I would definitely come back. 3 tacos cost me 20 buck which in my opinion is not bad. 

Keep Eating, 
Angela"
Campechano Taquería	5	2019-08-12	"I've been looking all over town for the most authentic taquería in Toronto, and think I've finally found it. Campechano had a great patio, hearty tacos, great corn tortillas, and a solid margarita.

Pastor - definitely one of my new favourite tacos in Toronto. The meat was well marinated, had a strong spicy kick (a little spicier than I expected tbh but not too much) and the sweet acidic pineapple complimented it perfectly.

Campechano - the meat in this one was incredibly juicy and well cooked, and the sauces were nice and light, unlike many places where it can be an overbearing addition to a dish. 

Overall I would definitely come back here, order both the tacos again, and I can't wait to try more of them."
Campechano Taquería	3	2018-06-04	"Great tacos with a good spice level! The food at Campechano is tapas style and they have a wide range of tacos. 

The guacamole is served with a side of spiced nachos - they were a little dry and stale, but the guacamole was fresh. The ceviche is an European bass, with a nice kick of spice as well. I ordered the fish taco which was freshly deep fried and simply delicious. 

The restaurant has a patio with outdoor seating, as well as bench like seating for larger groups. Unfortunately, the service is not as great as the food thus meriting a 3 star."
Campechano Taquería	4	2018-03-17	"Rating: This is a solid 3 1/2* with the bump of 1/2* for the circumstance of my visit. 

I had this place bookmarked for a while but a recent review by a fellow Yelper (shout-out to Sammie S.) made me realize that I was walking by Campechano on my way for lunch to a different place. 

So what was I to do? 
I decided to get a smaller dish at the lunch place in order to stop at Campechano for a few tacos. Luckily, I have a wife and daughter that humours me in my food pursuit. 

We arrived just after 2pm and the waitress informed us that the last call will be in 15 minutes as they close at 2:30pm. That was no problem since I was the only one interested in ordering something. This is a small place and I could see seating being an issue at busier times. Love their wall mural. 

The wait staff quickly provided us with a menu. I was disappointed that there was no shrimp tacos for lunch. So I decided to order the Bistec (Top Sirloin) and the Tinga de pollo (Chicken Breast). There's no way you could just order one taco even though you kind of full. 

The tacos came out fairly quick as you can see it being cooked in front of you as they have an open kitchen. I liked the Tinga the best. Both of the tacos had the Morita sauce which provided a nice little kick but the Bistec was overtly salty. Also the prices are a little steep but based on location, I can understand why. 

My dining experience at Campechano probably took no more than 10 minutes plus it was right before closing. That's why I want to give them the benefit of the doubt and bump up the rating to 4*. I'm hoping to come back for dinner and ask if they offer shrimp tacos. 

Solid tacos but not the best in the GTA.

Campechano Taquería	4	2019-12-12	Comfortable and welcoming environment, great service and decent prices! They also got a good selection for their drink menu!
Tacos El Asador	5	2020-05-20	"As an American having grown up around authentic Mexican and south American food, it isnt often I find an authentic mexicsn food experience in canada. This is where you can have that experience. 
Just ordered this place on uber eats during the virus lockdown and I was very happy with it. Bright me back to the days i lived in the US and they even had some surprising flavors that I havent tasted before! Fresh, tasty, passionate cooking, authentic and just an amazing experience. 

This is a special place I will be returning to and continuing to provide support for. Great job guys! 

The only recommendation I have is to consider adding horchata to the menu! ;)"
Tacos El Asador	1	2020-04-24	"Ordered beef burrito and pork pupusas through ubereats.
Started with the burrito which was bland and barely any beef/protein. I couldn't even finish the burrito because it was so bad and I decided to try the pupusas.
It was hard by the time I got to it. Think twice before ordering..."
Tacos El Asador	3	2020-02-22	"So I'm from San Diego. It is VERY hard for me to find anything even close in taste and quality.

This place has high ratings on here, so we decide to take a shot.

I regret that decision. I ordered three tacos (beef, pastor, carnitas.) The beef tasted like beef jerky, the pastor was super dry and bland, the carnitas tasted like cat food. 

Also you can't just order a small side of chips. It's $10 nachos or $11 guacamole (does it come with chips? Who knows?!)

Super disappointed. Literally had to get boba tea immediately after to cleanse the pallet."
Tacos El Asador	4	2020-02-05	"Great little place decorated with blinking Christmas lights and coloured picnic tables. Their tacos are reasonably priced ($5-7) and really filling. The guac and chips ($11) are always good to share. Sometimes their tacos might be a bit dry but they have some spicy sauce and salsa on the side!! 

Great place for a chill and cheap weeknight dinner."
Tacos El Asador	4	2019-07-02	"New location!
Improvement.
Would function better if customers paid at front, took a number and had a seat.
Doesn't need waiters, slows it down."
Tacos El Asador	2	2020-06-02	The service was amazing, the guy that greeted us especially was very enthusiastic. But .. when it came from the food. it was definitely 1/5. No flavour , no seasoning no nothing. We ordered 6 Tacos, Guac and chips and cheese Pupusas . To begin with the tacos lets just say we didn't eat them all. The shrimp tasted too.. fishy? not enough toppings on the taco. The beef was blend and so was the chicken. Only good thing about our order was the guac and chips. I normally go to taco Gus at Kensington (highly recommend ) and I regret trying something new.
Tacos El Asador	1	2020-02-14	"It is Valentine's Day, I was so happy my boyfriend came from the Netherlands to visit and we had the best day exploring the city, afterwards we were too tired to go out so opted to order in some good Mexican food! 

We consider ourselves taco connoisseurs, and often indulge in a tasty tactac. We were VERY excited to have so many taco options so we ordered 3 soft shells and 3 crispy shells (as other Mexican enthusiasts may know, is not as common as people may think to have both shells) 

To provide more context you didn't ask for ... this was the first MUCH anticipated spot on our taco tour of Toronto. 

We have a methodical and detailed evaluation system in place for reviewing and ranking our tacsperiences - the system ranks the following on a scale of 1-5 (5 being the best) ; 

flavour and freshness (1)
Moisture (0)
Mouth feel (1)
Crunch (0)
Contents to Shell ratio (0)
Cheese Quality (0 - cheese unaccounted for, still looking for it)
Smell (2)
Overall (4/35) 

This may seem bitter, however, we are AS unbiased as they come. 
Furthermore, we are highly liberal individuals. Our disappointment is immeasurable yet our day is not ruined, because we still have each other, and our view is lovely (will include pic) 

We hope this is a one off, and the in person experience is better than delivery."
Tacos El Asador	5	2020-01-07	"WOW! I ate there lastnight and wish I could return tonight! Two of us ordered Specials with steak and salad. Mine came with refried bean, guacamole, soft corn tortilla, caramelized onions etc.! It was so flavourful and delicious. 
Highly recommend eating here. Our server (long time server) and kitchen staff were lovely. Cozy environment; perfect for our special date."
Tacos El Asador	5	2019-12-04	"I've been coming to Tacos El Asador for almost a decade. It's my go to lunch place, inexpensive and so tasty. Whenever I go to higher end taco joints I usually leave disappointed because they're not as good as TEA's and more expensive! The TEA staff are friendly and kind. I'm glad they opened up the new location (which is hardly new at this point) and that more people can enjoy eating in.

Tip: the tostadas are their hidden secret. Happy eating!"
Tacos El Asador	4	2019-11-18	The food here is quite authentic. Have tried many items and all were good. The lunch specials are good value and so are the drink specials. Staff are culturally appropriate which is great. Be aware it is CASH ONLY.  The tables are quite tightly positioned so be prepared to have your chair bumped a few times. You must ask for additional hot sauces (no charge) so be pro-active. The lunch burrito will fill a normal person for a day ! Blows away the chain burrito places. Servings in general are generous.
Tacos El Asador	5	2019-04-23	"From the tortillas to the flavour of the pork, Tacos El Asador brings back memories from my trip to Mexico. Having tried a few other taco places in the city, I can definitely say that TEA takes the cake for me!

I came with my girlfriend later on in the evening and was greeted by the infamous Smokey. He asked us how many and we replied back ""two people"" and then he replied back with ""three"". We said ""no, two people"" and Smokey proceeded to point at each of us and said ""one, two"" then points at himself and says ""three"". He definitely made our night.

We got seated in less than 20 minutes, ordered right away with some nachos, pork tacos and plantain. Wow did that bring back some memories of the taco stand in Mexico! All I can say is, you need to go there and try the food and take my word for it."
Tacos El Asador	5	2019-04-19	"I came here on a bustling evening 30 mins before close(we hadn't realized they closed earlier than most restaurants in Korea town), however we weren't the last to walk through the doors. 

Since the restaurant is on the smaller side, we had to wait about 20 minutes before being seated. Even though they were close to closing, they didn't rush us at all.

The atmosphere is very cozy, laidback yet still lively. The service was great, our server was super outgoing and humorous which is nice after a long day at work. Food is very affordable, they have many options but not too many it becomes overwhelming. 


I ordered the chorizo and the pork soft taco, and all I can say is it brought me back to my trip in Mexico. The meat was juicy and the toppings were fresh. I also ordered the rice with cheese, although simple was great. 
We ordered plantains as well, and that was the icing on the cake to us. Instantly made me want to go back to Mexico. 

Would definitely come back, just wish they were open a little later."
Tacos El Asador	5	2019-03-30	"Itching for an escape down south but can't swing the vacation days? Koreatown's El Asador offers an authentic Latin American experience, minus the pricey return flight. They boast the best tacos in town, which I can confirm from my own personal Toronto taco touring. As a vegetarian, it can be hard to find options that actually excite me, but El Asador's veggie tostadas come with delicious, fresh guac (and no, the guac is not extra!) and the veggie options are cheaper than the meat versions, which doesn't always happen.

If you're expecting a resort-like experience, El Asador may not live up to your 5-star expectations. But if you can get down with local living, you'll enjoy this no frills place, with picnic bench seating and plastic cups. The food is fantastic, the service is friendly, and the owner's expressive eyebrows (you'll know when you get there) are sure to make you smile. 

Affordable prices, a wide selection of beverages, and the new location offers more seating and a shorter wait."
Tacos El Asador	4	2019-10-23	Had a chicken burrito here and thought it was amazing! Not too filling, not too empty, just the right spice level, meat and condiments were quite flavorful and the pita itself was just the right firmness. Definitely a recommendation for anyone feeling like a burrito on a Saturday night!
Tacos El Asador	2	2019-02-26	"Cash only.. it's 2019 
Plates with holes in it.. it's 2019
Food is decent, but get the basics right"
Tacos El Asador	4	2018-07-16	"Came here with my girlfriend on a Sunday evening.

Pros:
+ good quality of food
+ tasty
+ friendly service

Cons:
- cash only
- decently expensive ($29 for 2 people without drinks)
- smaller portions

Food: (3.5 stars)
The food is pretty good but on the smaller size.  
We ordered the guacamole (4 stars): likely the best thing on the menu. 
Pretty expensive $9 for the size.  Usually taco restaurants would charge around $6 for this type of food.
The burrito (pulled pork) (3.5 stars) was tasty but again quite a bit smaller than expected. ($9 for it)
Tacos: We got a pulled pork (3 stars), and a fish taco (3.5 stars).  I thought the pulled pork was missing something extra, maybe some cilantro, maybe something else to add to the contrast of the pork.  The fish was a bit better, the onions made it a nice crunch to it. $4 each.


Atmosphere: (3.5 stars)
The place is pretty small and gets busy quickly, but it has a cozy feeling to it.  The tables and chairs are clean.  The washrooms are in the basement, with pretty low ceilings.

Service:  (4 stars)
They got table service, but paying at the front."
Tacos El Asador	4	2019-01-13	"CASH ONLY. 

Felt like that was important to note up top, although they have an ATM in the restaurant. 

Had the breakfast burrito ($9) with eggs, avocado, plantains, and the usual burrito ingredients. It was SO good. The sweetness from the plantains works so well with the hearty beans and rice. The eggs add that extra flavor and the avocado slips in there with a bit of cool fattiness. 

The restaurant is super casual and you sit on picnic style benches. At 1pm on a Sunday, it was almost full, but never crowded or loud. 

Would come back because the burrito was great."
Tacos El Asador	5	2019-09-03	"Great, authentic Mexican restaurant with a la carte menu items. Order one taco (or quesadilla or burrito or enchilada) or 50. Food came out very quickly and was amazing!

Warning: CASH ONLY!"
Tacos El Asador	5	2017-10-14	"This was a great gem, worth the drive if you crave some authentic tacos!

I was a bit surprised to find this well run taco joint amongst all Korean restaurants but it really works!

Lots of bench style seating easily fits 4, but gets squishy as this place fills up at lunch time. The service is quick, the food came fast and hot and for tacos, quesadilla, burrito type foods, but our pupusa came after tacos, maybe cuz of table room? Cuz they certainly not a dessert dish. 

The warm corn wraps were so so good, guacamole was fresh and the perfect green and texture. I had to try one fish and one shrimp taco with a squash pupusa(pan fried puffy corn tortilla pancake like thing? served with a pickled cabbage slaw and hot sauce salsa) and was ok full but ordered another shrimp taco just in case 

Easily you can start lunch less than $4, but really takes 3-4 tacos for a good lunch which run closer to $15, they have good combos for certain days which is nice and take out was very popular while we were here. My girlfriends all agreed the fish was best of the tacos, and would easily come back tomorrow after our seminar."
Tacos El Asador	3	2018-10-22	"Who doesn't love a good taco?

I surely do, so I was happy to meet my dining companion at Tacos El Asador, as authentic-sounding a taco joint as I've ever encountered in our fair city.

I decided to go with the Chorizo and the Birria (Goat) tacos, with the latter arriving first. I don't think I've ever eaten goat meat in the context, so I was definitely excited to give this one a try. It didn't disappoint. The meat was cooked perfectly and contained a very flavorful blend of spices, while the two sauces on the table, of which one is impressively hot, effectively enhance the taste of the concoction.

The Chorizo arrived next and while it too was quite good, it didn't blow me away like the first one. It tasted like virtually every other chorizo taco I've ever eaten; there weren't any unexpected flavors at work here, and in fact, the chorizo itself was a little bit on the bland side. I still enjoyed the heck out of it, though, especially when I added those aforementioned sauces.

I also ordered a bowl of their Chicken, Black Beans and Tortilla Soup. I'm no tortilla soup expert, so it's entirely possible this was an above-average variation, but I wasn't impressed. The broth was salty without being flavorful, while the plentiful bits of tortilla got soggy immediately and gave the dish a rather unpleasant texture. I should note, too, that the soup comes with a fairly hefty amount of cheese, which definitely should have been indicated on the menu."
El Nahual Tacos	5	2020-06-03	"After hearing so much good things about this taco spot in the Annex Food Hall, I couldn't wait to try their take-home TACO KITS!!

How to order: 
-online through the tacokittoronto.com website for pick-up or delivery 
-Tuesday DELIVERY IS FREE if you pre-order by the previous Sunday

The Taco kits:
Each kit is only $20-$25 & easily feeds 1-2 people! I tried their Yucatan chicken & Barbacoa Beef. Each came with their own super fresh chopped up toppings and baggie of corn tortillas. I reheated the meat by microwaving in time intervals and the tortillas were warmed on a stovetop pan with a bit of oil.

YUCATAN CHICKEN (4.5/5) - saucey and the complex spices that marinated the juicy chicken was perfection. Paired with pickled radish & cheese made the flavours pop even more.

BARBACOA BEEF (5/5) - THE JUICIEST shreds of flavourful beef. I absolutely loved the freshness that a sprinkle of onions, cilantro & lime did to it. And I can't forget about that creamy avocado spread! 

Overall:
I'm honestly so surprised at how generous they were with their ingredients and the amazingly JUICY & FLAVOUR-PACKED meats. These taco kits are easy, fresh, and a fun way to do take-out. Definitely recommend giving El Nahual a try for your next Taco Tuesday!"
El Nahual Tacos	5	2020-02-20	"I had a fried fish taco ($4.95) and tortilla chips ($3.75) here and they were delicious.  I was with my husband and a group of friends, so I think among all of us we tried every single taco they offer.  Note that they only have 1 vegetarian option (and no vegan options on the menu, although you may be able to make a special request).  Luckily the vegetarian option is vegetables wrapped in crispy cheese, and the one vegetarian in our group loves cheese, lol.  

The fish in my taco was crispy on the outside and soft and flaky on the inside.  It was battered and fried, but didn't taste overly greasy.  The fish was on top of shredded cabbage, and a green creamy sauce was drizzled on top.  

Chips were crispy and didn't taste like they came out of a bag. I liked the creamy avocado dipping sauce they came with, but would have appreciated a more mainstream salsa as well, lol (you know, like the one with cut up tomatoes). 

Can't wait to try their other tacos.

This location is in The Annex Food Hall."
El Nahual Tacos	4	2020-02-13	"Last Saturday, I sampled a number of food items from different food stalls at the Annex Food Hall. I have been on a taco kick since late December 2019. It must have been eating all that Christmas turkey and wanting a change. Naturally, I had to try what El Nahual Tacos had to offer.

I had already had some food from Mean Bao. Although the deal for three tacos for $13 was mighty appealing, I didn't want that much food. Instead, I went with the fish taco, and chips and salsa. Perfect!

The fish is cod in the taco. I'm good with a flaky fish. I waited for a bit for my order. Moments later, my food was ready.

The fish taco was delicious. I love how fresh the fish was. The batter was thin and crispy, which it should be. The taco was perfect and the flavours in the taco were spot on. The chips were hot out of the fryer. The salsa had mild cilantro in it. It was okay, but I was hoping for more of a tomato version of salsa. I still ate it all.

I was with a number of friends that evening. We ended up getting more tacos, and chips with salsa. So much food! I grabbed a pulled beef taco. I give it full marks for tenderness. However, it was super salty for my liking. I remember feeling thirsty afterwards and drinking a ton of water to balance my system out. I then felt bloated... haha!

I'd love to try more tacos here. I have the inclination that the pulled versions of their proteins are heavy on the sodium, so I'll steer away from them. The food is yummy here, despite that minor setback.

El Nahual Tacos	5	2020-02-10	"We were here with friends for dinner. I love variety and trying new things and they didn't disappoint.  We had the open face tacos and they created some really unique flavour combinations.

We tried one of 6 different open face tacos.  See my pictures. They were all delicious.  The 6 different ones were:
(1) Carrnitas. Braised pulled pork, pickled carrot.
(2) Al Pastor (mild). Marinated pork with dried chiles, spices and achote, onion, cilantro, grilled pineapple.
(3) Black Tiger Shrimp. Garlic crispy cheese on tortilla, onion, grilled peppers, cilantro, avocado salsa.
(4) Fried Fish. Cod marinated with oregano, cilantro, cabbage slaw, cilantro aioli.
(5) Pulled Beef Barbacoa (mild). Slow cooked spiced beef blade, cilantro, onion, avocado salsa.
(6) Chorizo (mild). House-made spiced pork, onion, cilantro, avocado salsa, wrapped in crispy mozzarella.

They had bottled drinks from Jarritos Canada.

Since this food stall is part of The Annex Food Hall, you would use the large seating area, free WiFi, and washrooms of the food hall."
El Nahual Tacos	5	2020-03-24	The tacos took forever to make but they were delicious! Fresh off the grill and straight into our bellies real quick. I especially enjoyed the baja fish taco - it had just the right amount of crispiness and was not too salty like other baha fish tacos that I've tried. It was just right. What I really appreciated was that the chef personally delivered us our food. Now that's above and beyond! Would be down for coming back again.
El Nahual Tacos	5	2019-05-21	"Love these tacos. So delicious. I have no other words other than yum. They make their tortillas themselves and they're tasty. They only take cash so bring some if you want to try more tacos. the space is small so hopefully it's not busy and you can find yourself a spot to eat. 

Will I be back? For sure. One of my favourites for tacos in the city"
El Nahual Tacos	5	2019-09-28	"We were originally going to a pizza place, but just so happen to randomly find this place on yelp.

I had 3 tacos: carnitas, barbacoa and black tiger shrimp. They were my favourite in that order. The tacos have minimal toppings, but that actually made them taste better. The tiger shrimp had a coleslaw type thing on it and cilantro. Keeping each taco to only 2 or 3 toppings helped emphasize the juiciness of the meat. The carnitas was my favourite because it was juicy and a little sweet."
El Nahual Tacos	2	2019-09-10	"To be completely honest. I was expecting more.
I came in during my lunch while practically salivating on hearing the reviews. I ordered the 3 TACOS: FISH, BARBACOA? AND CARNITAS. fish taco was so bland and had no taste. The beef was pretty good. CARNITAS was decent. Service left more to be desired as the gentleman never asked if I wanted anything else but just requested I pay. Felt rushed.!"
El Nahual Tacos	4	2019-08-01	It was hard to choose what to eat in the Annex Food Hall when there were sooo many tempting options. I decided on El Nahual honestly, because I wasn't hungry enough for a full meal, and thought two tacos would be the perfect amount of food. The vegetarian taco was a surprising star. I usually go for meat tacos, but found the veg option to actually be superior to the el pastor taco. There is a hunk of something (cheese, maybe?) that is wrapped in a layer that reminds me of bean curd sheets. If someone knows what that is, please let me know!!
El Nahual Tacos	5	2019-07-26	Let me start by saying that THESE ARE THE BEST SHRIMP TACOS I'VE EVER HAD! I was taking a stroll through the annex and stopped by the Annex Food Hall for something to eat. They have a lot of food options btw; but it's El Nahual that caught my eye that day. I got the three shrimp tacos (and they are NOT stingy with the shrimp), it was made to order. It's not full service but the guy who took my order was nice, I'm really indecisive so I really appreciate it when people take the time to help me out without rushing me. Overall the tacos were great, but it was the tortilla that had my heart, I don't know what kind it is but I have never had a tortilla like that! I would recommend this place to anyone looking for the great tacos!!
El Nahual Tacos	4	2018-05-29	"Note:  This restaurant is more for a quick bite / take-out.  Although I really wouldn't recommend that you wait too long as I don't think the tacos will taste as good!

Tacos appear to be small, but they really pack a punch in terms of taste!  I ordered 3 tacos/$12:  Fish, Yucatan Chicken, & Al Pastor.  All of them tasted distinct, with different toppings, and were visually appealing as well.  They looked as though pride was taken in the presentation of the tacos!  Very good and I was actually full after eating them.  Initially, I was doubtful when I saw how petit they were.  :)

Parking:  ""Restaurant"" is located on the smaller, north side of Keele Street.  There is PAID angled parking just in front/across the street.  During my visit, there were plenty of street parking (paid) on Eglinton itself.  If you're eastbound on Eglinton Ave W, it can be tricky to turn left onto this small street as the street is very busy / undergoing construction.  

Atmosphere:  El Nahual is quite small.  There is only counter seating for 8-10ppl.  Stools are solid, but they look like crates turned on their side, so they're not very comfortable.  Again, this is why I said that I don't think this place is intended for dining in for an extended period of time.

It was really hot out when I came in and they kept the doors open.  It wasn't super uncomfortable, but it definitely will be if it was more humid.

Service:  Girl at the counter was very friendly and nice.  Note that the food does take a while, so DO NOT come here if you need to be in/out.  After I ordered, the girl said that tacos would take 15-20mins and that was pretty accurate.

I would definitely come back to try out other tacos &/or even get a burrito, but for now, only if I was in the area as it's quite congested and Eglinton is really messed up. 

Free chips w/ creamy guac with Yelp check-in!"
El Nahual Tacos	5	2019-09-02	"Delicious tacos. I appreciated the 3 for $13 special. 

It's nice that this place is in a Food Hall, so that my husband and I could experience food from multiple places."
El Nahual Tacos	5	2019-01-05	"Hands down the best tacos in Toronto! (at least based on what I've tried so far). We tried both chickens, the barbacoa and the shrimp tacos. The flavors are all right one. The meat is juicy with flavorful sauces and garnished perfectly. The tortillas seem to be homemade corn tortillas. Having lived in US for several years I've had a lot of Mexican food and El Nahual was definitely comparable to some of the best places I've been to. We specially really liked barbacoa and the shrimp and the Yucatan chicken. 

Food: 5/5
Service and atmosphere: 4.5/5
Price: 4.5/5
Overall: 5/5"
El Nahual Tacos	3	2018-06-12	"Stumbled upon this restaurant while searching for lunch before heading to Yorkdale. The restaurant is quite small, more of a takeout joint and seats about 6 people. The restaurant is very hot and humid and there was only one fan facing the window. There is free street parking (depending on the time), however there is paid parking directly in front of the restaurant.

We ordered the 3 for $12 ( Black Tiger Shrimp, Fish & Carnitas tacos). The food was flavourful, however it didn't hit the spot for me. We also took advantage of the free chips and salsa check in offer.

Overall, nice presentation of the tacos but I wouldn't be going out of my way to come back to satisfy my taco cravings."
El Nahual Tacos	3	2019-11-13	I got the 6inch shrimp burrito -- definitely not the best burrito I've ever had but it wasn't bad either. I enjoyed it but was disappointed when they said they didn't have any hot sauce?!! You also can't choose toppings either, I'm pretty sure all the burritos comes with the same thing (rice + peppers and onions) Again, tasted good didn't mind that at all but I think my extreme hunger made it taste a lot better, if that makes any sense. I probably won't be back but glad I got to try this place out!!! Maybe if I had tried the tacos my opinion would be different but you can def find better taco places I'm sure
El Nahual Tacos	5	2017-12-01	"I found this place thanks to my wife as we were taking a shortcut as the 401 East was very busy (more than usual) and decided to go through the local roads. Since it was close to dinner time, she found El Nahual through the Yelp app. She was craving Mexican! It was Tacos Thursday. 

This place is by Eglinton West on a one way street. Tiny place located amidst the constant construction and traffic around the area. Ideal for takeout as they have very limited seating and space. Even the outside signage is unassuming. There are some pay parking on the front of the store but there's a 3 hour free parking if you turn right in the next street. 

My wife and I ordered the same 3 tacos: Gringa, Steak and Shrimp. All of them were very good but the shrimp is the winner. My wife and I would rate the Gringa (Pork) for least favourite. I loved their tortillas. You do have to wait for your tacos as they do per order and they are not premade but that's a small price to pay for such delicious tacos. We washed down the tacos with a Pellegrino drink and a Horchata.

As much as I want to come back, we are rarely in the area but now we know where to come in order to try the other tacos in the menu. It seems that some of the dishes sells out throughout the day so come early if possible. 

Highly recommended!"
El Nahual Tacos	4	2017-12-03	"Seriously great tacos here! The first time I went was not long after they'd opened for business and it took a while to get my order, despite being the only customer at the time. They make everything fresh to order, including the tortillas, so I wasn't too disappointed about waiting. 

On my last visit, I was with four of my coworkers on our lunch break. There were a few other people in the restaurant as well, so I worried it might take too long for our food - I had a meeting to get to, so I was keeping my eye on the clock. 

To my pleasant surprise, the food was coming out quickly. Since all five of us had ordered the 3 tacos for $10 special, they basically just made one of each order at a time, so we could all start eating at the same time. By the time we'd finished our first taco, the next one would be ready. Great system. 

I had three different tacos: fish, carnitas and chorizo. It's hard to pick a favourite as they were all fantastic, but most everyone in our group raved about the fish tacos. The batter was so light and crunchy, and not at all greasy. But I'd take any of them again in a heartbeat. 

The guys working there were super friendly and really quick to keep things moving along. The restaurant itself is very small, with only about 6-8 stools available to sit down to eat. Not super comfortable, so it's not really somewhere you'd want to spend too much time. 

I'll likely get takeout next time. Maybe a burrito..."
El Nahual Tacos	5	2017-09-20	"Hole in the wall with limited seating and it was a bit of hard to find to the location because of construction happening in the area. However that made this adventure even better.

I went to high school in this area and it has the reputation for excellent Caribbean and Portuguese delights but this Mexican joint is amazing. Well done and friendly service. The 3 for $10 is an amazing offer. It is at the NE corner of keele and eglinton by the dollar store.

The fish was amazing. I am definitely going back!

Thanks"
El Nahual Tacos	4	2018-07-14	"Im torn with this review.
The tacos were amazing but the wait was dreadful. If we didnt hve to wait like an hr it would def be a 5 star rating.
I loved this place, authentic tacos. They even make the corn tortillas in house.
The tacos are 3 for 12$ I believe and they have a pretty decent sized menu. Something for everyone. Come early as they did run out of stuff for others that came after us. Although it was 30 mins before closing time.
We ordered 2 Yucatan, 1 shrimp, 1 fish, 1 beef, and 1 chicken mole.
They were all amazing! But i have to say the fish was my fav. So nice and crispy on the outside and perfectly seasoned filet on the inside. The toppings were pefect, im drooling as I write this review.
My partners favorite was the chicken mole he def wish we got another order. This is def our new spot although we dont live close by.

The seating is very limited and there is not much to do while you wait. We went to the dollarstore and browsed and walked around the block a few times. Still had more to wait. Mahbe next time.Ill get a pedicure across the street while I wait ."
El Nahual Tacos	4	2019-01-27	Came here for a quick lunch during work hours. Overall, tacos were good, but I felt the tortillas were a little dough-y. I ordered chorizo, fish, pulled pork, and I forgot what the last one was. If you're in the area and craving for some Mexican tacos, give this place a try. They accept all payments and heads up, seating is very limited.
La Carnita	5	2020-05-03	My sister and I came here during March break. We loved it honestly. Good food, damn good music, chill vibes, great service. I'm one of those people that likes to ask what's good, and their food and drink recommendations were spot on. We loved it so much we even came back again on our trip! Servers were cool as hell and made us feel very welcome!
La Carnita	3	2020-01-07	"3.5 stars!

I came here for a pitcher of sangria while I waited for DaiLo to open for dinner service. The staff wasn't the most welcoming and the sangria tasted like straight-up soda. I can't really speak to the food since I wasn't planning on dining here but people poured in right at opening time so that must be a good sign. 

Maybe the food here is phenomenal but I wasn't obsessed with my bar experience. Just ok."
La Carnita	3	2019-08-21	"My friends and I (6+ people) came on a Tuesday for the Tuesday special where you get 8 hardshell tacos to share. My friends ordered the other tacos and really liked the 'In Cod We Trust' taco. We also had quesadillas, corn, and churros (really delicious btw, I highly recommend). I also ordered a cocktail and was surprised at the alcohol content, despite the small portion. Overall, I found the food to be really tasty and well seasoned! I just found the portion sizes to be quite small for the prices they were charging.

Our server did a great job on checking up on us and keeping up with our orders. We would occassionally just blurt out to add another item and I was impressed that they remembered it all- thank you!! Our server was also quite engaging, which made this place very welcoming and down to earth. 

The interior is decorated quite nicely and this place is very hipster. I would also recommend booking a table because, despite the numerous amounts of tables, quite a lot of them were reserved. There is also a bar for people who want to pop by for drinks only. 

The food came at a timely manner and the place was quite comfy. We were decently full but the prices really weren't worth the portion sizes we were given. This knocked back a few stars for me. Also, the bill could not be separated so figuring that out with a large group was not so favorable. Being a large group, we were not notified about the automatic gratuity until we asked for the bill at the end."
La Carnita	3	2019-09-22	"I'll start off by saying that I firmly believe that people come here for the atmosphere. It's a great place to just hang out, enjoy the music, and the drinks ! The taco's aren't the best I've ever had...nor are they the worst tacos either. You're paying almost $6 for ONE little TINY sample sized taco. So you don't get your money's worth at all.  They have quite a bit of options to choose from when it comes to tacos which is actually a pro to this place( except for when some options are sold out..). A huge con to me would be the fact that some of my tacos were cold by the time it got to me.. another huge con would be the service. Considering that there were literally 4 customers seated you would have expected them to be a lot more attentive, but that wasn't the case. Anyways the chances of me returning to eat are extremely low. Might just stop in to have a drink if I'm ever in the area though...HOWEVER if you do decide to give this place a try..  go for the shrimp taco ! 

$60 dollars later... stomach was still growling and I had to head over to McDonalds. ..."
La Carnita	4	2019-11-22	"I came here with 3 friends on a Saturday afternoon. It was surprisingly NOT busy at all.. maybe 2 other tables were seated? I was surprised because I heard great reviews about this place.

The service was a slow (oddly), but the food was good. The only thing I didn't care for were the chips. They were so hard and crunchy, it felt like I was cutting my gums with every bite."
La Carnita	4	2019-09-16	A very warm and welcoming atmosphere especially if you can get the tables tucked away in the back. Food is great and everyone enjoyed what they ordered. The portions are small so if you enjoy eating make sure to order a good amount.
La Carnita	4	2018-08-04	"Growing up in Toronto, I never realized how lucky I was to be surrounded by amazing taco places but after being exposed to mediocre Mexican food for a year while away at college I found myself falling in love with La Carnita.

I came here with two friends on a summer afternoon and sat out on the patio. We ordered 5 tacos and tortilla chips with dip to share, my friend got the street corn for herself (which she loved) and I ordered the iced horchata for myself (which was delicious). 

Overall, the tacos and chips were quite flavorful and enjoyable to share between the three of us. Each taco was STUFFED with filling and sauce without the tortilla getting too soggy (which is a FEAT for most restaurants) but for $5 -$7 I was disappointed they were pretty small relative to other taco places around Toronto. 

I'd come back again for the atmosphere, the tacos, and to try the sangria/cocktails!"
La Carnita	3	2019-02-16	"I came here for a birthday dinner on Saturday at 8pm. We were a party of 5 and didn't have a reservation so our wait time was around 1hr but only because a reservation was cancelled. If it wasn't, we probably would have waited closer to 2hrs. 
Every time I come to La Carnita, I always get the pollo frito taco but unfortunately they sold out :( I ended up getting the achiote chicken instead and I didn't read the description properly so completely overlooked the jalapeno salsa part. It was so spicy for me, I was tearing up but completely my fault for not reading the menu lol. 
The service was quick, we received our order of Mexican Corn shortly after we placed our order and our tacos came out just before we finished the corn. 

This location is a little cramped for my liking but the food quality is the same with all the other places. I've always enjoyed my dining experience at La Carnita. A reservation is strongly recommended though, otherwise you might have to wait over an hour like I did."
La Carnita	1	2020-02-16	"Worst service ever.  Staff don't care about the guests.  No table check. We had to hunt down a server to get a drink and order food. 

Cool vibe but would not recommend"
La Carnita	5	2018-08-22	"This is the kind of place to go to when you're in Little Italy and are craving a mean taco.

But first, let me start with the chips and guac. The chips are fried to perfection, have an incredible crunch, and there's a hearty portion. The guac is delicious, and the pair go together really well.

Onto the star of the show: the tacos. I had the Pollo Frito, Carne Asada and Crispy Cod. I've had better fish tacos elsewhere, but the pollo and carne were really delicious and flavourful. The crunch of the pollo frito matched perfectly with all of its toppings, and it's oozing juices all over the place. So good. The carne was steak done right, and was a great ending to the meal. 

No complaints here. If you want an awesome taco night out with friends, this is the place to be."
La Carnita	4	2018-11-21	"La Carnita remains one of my go-to spots for tacos in Toronto. I love the food here. The only thing I dislike is the wait. There have been times when the wait wasn't very long but it is normally quite long. 

My favorites are:

Mexican Street Corn - The corn is smothered in sauce and it is just so tasty. I highly recommend this item as an appetizer. I get this almost every time I am here. 

In Cod We Trust taco - This remains my favorite. The cod is lightly battered and the vegetables on it go well with it. 

Overall I think La Carnita is a solid spot for Mexican food!"
La Carnita	3	2019-01-28	Stopped here for an after dinner snack and ended up sharing and app and a couple tacos with friends. Not much to say since we were here for a short time, but the food was definitely tasty!
La Carnita	4	2019-08-03	This is a great taco place. All of the tacos are unique and delicious. The margaritas and other cocktails are very good. Only disappointing thing was our server, who really ruined the dinner experience for us - but I won't hold it against the restaurant.
La Carnita	5	2019-06-17	"Delicious tacos with a great variety. Prices are reasonable $$ 
Place is small but great for dates or groups. Awesome tacos and try the churros they are epic.
I prefer this location vs John street."
La Carnita	1	2018-09-24	"Totally disappointing - everything is definitely on the over-seasoned/extremely salty side. Or totally BURNT! 

The chips we were served were totally burnt and we were told they were the batch of the day and there was nothing they can do about it. (Check pic)

The chips were followed by a totally burnt batch of corn- were not talking grill marks here, crust black corn. We were told that how it's severed (no it's not, we've been here before!). Is there no one to check what comes out of the kitchen??

To add insult to injury chewed on an avocado pit in the guacamole. 

Hosting and service were another issue. Extremely disappointing experience all in all. Fails at all basic hospitality and restaurant standard."
La Carnita	1	2019-10-06	"I have been here a few years ago and not sure what changed in that time but the service yesterday (Sat - Oct 5) was pretty terrible. If it were only one thing I wouldn't really bother but every aspect left the three of us shaking our heads. 
- even after putting my name down an waiting for an hour, we never got the call that our table is ready. Upon walking in after an hour the hostess checked the iPad and just lead us to the table. No clarification about why we weren't called.
- the table wasn't really cleaned-up or arranged. We had to pick it up and move so my friend could get in and not hit the people sitting on the adjacent table.
- the server didn't show up got more than 10 minutes
- when he finally came to take our order, he only took drink order (we were ready to order the full meal as we had waited over an hour and then 10 mins more for the server). Then after a few more minutes the server came and took our food order. 
- Food arrived, but no silverware to eat (salad). And then when we were almost done eating, we had to remind the server about our drinks order (smh).
- Finally had to wait to get the bill and then to pay too. Almost wanted to just walk out really. 
Mind you when we got our table, the restaurant wasn't as busy as before."
La Carnita	5	2019-02-19	"9.7/10 - I typed ""tacos"" in on Yelp and this place showed up to be half a mile from our AirBnb and we just walked there without looking at any of the photos or the menu. We walked in and I thought we were at a bar but it was a freaking taco bar. They were BUMPin' old Beyoncé and Kanye and it was a whole vibe in itself. Neon signs and rap with a side of over priced tacos that make you feel boujee like nothing else. - also we tried to take the leftover churros from the table next to ours and they wouldn't let us sooo that was whatever."
La Carnita	5	2018-07-06	"Went here for dinner while traveling through Toronto one weekend. 
First of all, great food & drinks. 
Not your typical Mexican restaurant, this place is definitely hipster/trendy. There are two tables of outdoor seating right as you walk into the restaurant off the street (very cute) and the rest of the seating is far back into the restaurant with booth and long share-table seats. Loved the vibe/interior. One taco ranges from $5-7USD. 

Food: I ordered the Cod taco as well as the fried chicken taco, both were delicious. The tacos are a little pricey BUT they are hearty, like they don't skimp on the fillings. For our appetizers we ordered the chips + 3 dips & chicken wings. Not sure what seasonings they put on their chips, but it was SO good that we ended up ordering another round! 
Drinks: get their sangria (my fave: Tangerine Guava Róse Sangria) omg...bomb AF! It's dangerous. 

Parking: street parking. We ended up parking about a block away. Traffic in the area is not very good, especially if it's at peak hours...
Great place, would definitely come back next time I'm in town!"
La Carnita	4	2018-08-23	Not too many gooooooood mexican joints in town, but this is a must try spot! I had the beef, pork, chkn and veggie tacos. All were very well seasoned, marinated, and the flavours come together so nicely! Of the tacos i had, one was a bit on the stale side, thats why it lost a star..but service was great! Staff were all very cheerful and friendly despite how busy it was. Keep it up guys!
La Carnita	4	2018-06-08	"Great service for a large party. Seated on the full communal table. 

However, they can only do split payment but not separate bills. With a $900 bill over 20 people, it's hard to figure out who owes what. 

The Cod Taco is still my only favourite on their menu. Nothing else really stood out to me. 

Their drinks are really good though - tastes fresh. 
My favourite is the GoldLink. I asked for another jalapeño drink and they were able to make me a Jalapeño Mojito. 

I always come back for the drinks."
Mi Taco Taqueria	4	2020-03-02	"Mi Taco Taqueria is a vibrant take-out/sit-down taco joint on Queen West for Tacos and a small selection of alcohol. The tacos here are very reasonably priced, with most of them at $4, and some at $5 and $6. Ingredients were very fresh, tacos were garnished with a variety of toppings and the meat was seasoned well. I've been here a couple times and found the carnitas and carne asada very delicious but nothing exceptional. This time I got the shrimp taco ($5) which was topped with cilantro, pico de gallo, cabbage and grilled and raw onions. The shrimps were pretty small (probably size 31/35 or 36/40) but were very fresh and gave a nice crunch. 

Compared to joints like Wilbur and Campechano, I'd say what Mi Taco Taqueria lacks in their tacos, they make up in their price point. For a cheap but very good taco, Mi Taco is the way to go."
Mi Taco Taqueria	5	2020-02-27	"Long Story Short: 
Great place for fresh, fast and delicious tacos! A+ on all fronts: food, service and atmosphere! 

Long Story Long: 
I'm not a big fan of fast food-style mexican food, but this place is delicious! The food is very fresh. We got 3 tacos: beef brisket, fish and shrimp. We also got the Chicken Tinga bowl. Everything was great!

The service was quick and friendly, even when we were making our way out the door. 

The decor is stunning and colourful, it made me really happy!

Great food, good price, and great vibes, highly recommend visiting for your taco fix!"
Mi Taco Taqueria	5	2019-11-17	"My family and I were looking for a place that had both meat and vegan tacos. This place kept coming up for us so we checked it out. 

I called the Queen St. location and they kindly advised us to check out the Bloor St. location because they were full. With the Bloor St. location being the closest to us, we took their advise. 

Upon arrival, there were only a few people there and a nice booth available for us. We ordered at the front and took our seat. the cashier with the long brown hair and tattoos on her arm was so sweet and friendly. 

She served us our drinks immediately (they have a nice selection of soft drinks and alcoholic drinks) and just to say, their prices were very fair for the amount of food we got. 

I got the vegan chorizo and it was delicious! The rice and beans made me feel like I was in Mexico, truly authentic and tasty! Full of flavour! 

Everyone else loves their tacos and we left very satisfied! They definitely work as a team at this location and it was nice to see!
Friendly, Tasty, Authentic and Vegan Options made our Friday night a great one! 

Gracias!"
Mi Taco Taqueria	3	2019-09-15	"Mi Taco Taqueria is a festive bright takeout/sit down place to grab a couple tacos and a drink. You order at the cashier and they give you a number so that you can seat yourself during the wait. They have a colorful seating area in the back, with interesting lights and banners to envoke a festive charm to the small space.

We ordered the guac and chips, and 6 tacos. The guac is on the small side but tastes fresh with plenty of herbs and bright flavors. Between the 6 tacos that we had, I prefered the carnitas and the sliced beef tacos the most. The flavoring was the most interesting, while the others were okay but at times a little bland. At $5-6 a peice, the tacos are not cheap but it can be expected due to the popular location."
Mi Taco Taqueria	4	2019-09-13	"Very cozy little place. I was passing by and noticed it and couldn't help buy try what they had to offer.
I ordered Baha tacos and churro. 
Very tasty tacos! A bit pricy I would say 5 bucks for one. But I really enjoyed it and would have it again.
Churro was ok, a bit too crispy for my taste and I wouldn't order it again.  
Overall I was pleased with my food!"
Mi Taco Taqueria	3	2019-05-03	"Hidden away on Queen West is this blink and you'll miss it taco joint. The interior is roughly the size of a shoebox, decorated festively, with a fake slanted roof. The roof makes it feel unnecessarily cramped. 

This place was rather disappointing. I brought my friends here because I enjoyed it a lot the first time around, but this visit was nowhere as good. The service here was wonderfully efficient, but the food was disappointing. I ordered the 3 taco plate (2 carnitas, 1 chicken tinga), chips and salsa verde, and a margarita. My total bill was around $22, which was not bad. The margarita was the best part of my order. 

Unlike other places, the margarita was strong. I got a good buzz from just one glass of margarita. It wasn't too sweet or tart or artificial-tasting, but rather perfectly balanced. The same cannot be said for the similarly green salsa verde. With saltier chips, the salsa might have tasted better, but with the very plain tortilla chips, the salsa tasted underseasoned and very vinegary - badly in need of salt. 

The tacos were similar in taste - while the freshness of the ingredients inside can be tasted, there wasn't enough of it, and it was hard to tell the difference between the chicken and the pork. A bit more seasoning could have helped. Lastly, the corn tortillas were absolutely dreadful. I had several mouthfuls of dry tortilla without filling to give it flavor and much-needed moisture, and it was like eating paper. I think the tortillas were kept under heat lamps for just a bit too long.

In summary, I'd come for the margaritas, but would not consider it this the best tacos in town."
Mi Taco Taqueria	5	2020-02-09	Outstanding tacos,  great atmosphere, and most importantly, phenomenal tacos. The tacos had a generous  amount of filling & the toppings were super fresh!
Mi Taco Taqueria	4	2019-09-10	"A decent taco option on a very busy stretch of Queen West. Tacos are 3.50 or combination of three for $11. They let you mix and match from the regular which I like. My friend recommended the beef brisket which was quite good. I also enjoyed the pollo and the beer but the carnitas was a bit dried out. Service was also a bit slow as the small kitchen was slammed with delivery orders. 

Overall I liked the place and would go here again. It does not beat out some of favourites on St Clair or in Kensington. Also they need some El Pastor!

Mi Taco Taqueria	2	2019-06-28	"In retrospect, it might have been a mistake to order a burrito from a taco joint.

But I'm a burrito guy; I would easily say it's one of my favorite foods ever, so if I spot it on a menu, I'm almost certainly ordering it.

And so it was that I found myself placing an order for a Carne Asada Burrito with all the fixins (including guacamole, which I paid extra for) on a recent Thursday evening.

After a wait of about 10 minutes, my burrito was ready to eat and I knew I had made a mistake with the very first bite. That first taste contained only plain iceberg lettuce and, worse still, it was almost ice cold. Yikes.

As I continued eating, I did begin to taste the Carne Asada and other ingredients and they are, to put it mildly, nothing special. There are virtually no bold flavors to be had here, and though I had asked for the spiciest level of heat, the burrito was surprisingly, disappointing bland.

The meat itself was chewy and unspectacular, too. The whole thing just tasted of a complete and total lack of effort, ultimately.

I might return to try one of Mi Taco's, uh, tacos, but I can't see myself ever ordering another burrito - especially when the far, far superior Burrito Boyz is just around the corner. (Heck, the nearby Mucho Burrito makes a better product!)"
Mi Taco Taqueria	4	2018-10-27	"My friend and I came for a late dinner after an event at the AGO. I've never been to Mexico before but from what I see in photos and in TV shows, this place looks like a true taqueria!

You order up at the cash and they will give you a number and bring you the food. I order the 3 taco combo (~$11) and guacomole and chips (~$6). I ordered the chicken tinga, braised pork and ground beef tacos, all mild and a combination of 2 corn and 1 flour tortillas.

Both kinds of tortilla were good (apparently they make it in house!). The corn tortilla was slightly more crispy / ""hard"" than the flour one, but definitely not as crispy as the hard tacos you get from Taco Bell. The diameter is smaller than the flour one, but more ""hearty"". The flour tortilla was thinner than what I have eaten at Mexican restaurants in Kensington Market.

All 3 types of taco fillings were good! But if I have to rank them, my favourite would be the chicken, beef and pork. I couldn't identify any individual flavours from any of the tacos, but the chicken one stood out in terms of well balanced flavour and the meat was not dry at all. I found the pork to be a bit dry.

My friend ordered the same taco combo as me, plus a pork burrito on flour tortilla. (Haha, don't judge, he didn't have a proper meal for the whole day.) The pork burrito was quite big, with a decent amount of meat. We both came to a consensus that the best combo was chicken tinga + flour tortilla.

As for the guacomole, it was okay. It was kind of bland and the portion was small for the price (~40g?) - don't think I will be getting it again. However, it was fresh and I like how they had chunks of avocado in it, instead of 100% puree.

I will be back to try the burrito!!!"
Mi Taco Taqueria	3	2018-09-06	"Visited Mi Taco Taqueria for a quick snack - guacamole with chips ($4). The nachos did not tasted fresh. I felt like the guacamole and chips ratio is off. It was very disappointing. Perhaps the other items are better. 

Not a big fan. I may be back to give it a second chance to try the tacos."
Mi Taco Taqueria	3	2019-02-27	"My husband and I went to this cute taqueria last week. I liked the simple ordering process of ordering your food at the counter and then eating in a tucked away back area of the narrow restaurant that was decorated with colourful pennant flags, strings of lights and wooden furniture (some high top tables, others were little booths). I appreciated the cute street food dining type of vibe in there, as well as the friendly staff at the counter and who brought the food to our table.

We ordered the carnita burrito bowl and the grilled fish burrito bowl since we thought it would be more filling than getting just the tacos. When our burrito bowls arrived, each bowl was filled with fresh vegetables, cheese and sour cream to accompany the grilled fish and pork. While the bowls were definitely filling, they were just okay in terms of flavour. I have to admit, it was a bit underwhelming considering the great reviews this place has gotten. Nothing really stood out - I would have loved to taste more of a marinade on the carnitas and the fish was a bit plain. More seasoning or sauces on the protein would have helped the flavours come together more in the burrito bowl. Again, not a horrible meal by any means but not really memorable either... personally, it was a bit of a miss for me on this particular visit but I may come back another time to try some of their other offerings to see if I can upgrade this review."
Mi Taco Taqueria	5	2018-08-28	"This place is easy to miss. It's almost a hole in the wall along Queen St, but once you step in, you'll be very happy that you did.

There's a good assortment of tacos and burritos here. Due to my carnivorous nature, I got the carne asada, beef brisket, and chicken tinga tacos. The toppings complement the tacos perfectly, and the end result is a flavour explosion once you bite into the taco. You know it's good when juice is dripping all over your hand and onto the tray. The flour tortilla is made in-house and is marvelous.

The chips and guac were also awesome and were a perfect ending to an excellent meal. Customer service here is also 5-star, so your entire dining experience will be great."
Mi Taco Taqueria	4	2019-03-09	Mi Taco Taqueria is a very small taco joint near Queen and University. It's easy to walk by and miss if you are just passing through. I live in the neighborhood and stumbled upon it one evening around 6pm. I thought I'd give it a try and am glad I did. You order at the cash and take a seat. Service is friendly and their tacos are quite good. I've tried four different flavours and they were all good. I prefer shrimp with flour tortilla over the corn tortilla, but that is personal preference. It's a perfect spot if you want a casual but quality meal.
Mi Taco Taqueria	3	2018-07-03	"If I ever need a quick fix for Taco's I would probably go back. The tacos were small, small amounts of filling but overall the taste was not bad. You get 3 small Tacos for $10 something. I wish they were a bit bigger and there was more topping options. 

Keep Eating, 
Angela"
Mi Taco Taqueria	4	2020-02-06	Ordered through Ritual. Nice atmosphere. Order  ready on time. Chicken Tinga tacos had ggood flavour our. Maybe a bit on the small side but overall good value
Mi Taco Taqueria	5	2018-10-07	"This place is great! I've been craving tacos for a long time and decided to check this restaurant out. It was a small and cozy restaurant with great decorations. 

I got the chicken, the beef, and the pork tacos. I got a number and they brought the tacos out to me. They were seriously filled with meats and stuffings! I don't think I've ever had a taco that had so much filling. While I usually get 4 tacos, 3 tacos here were definitely enough to fill me up. 

I'll definitely be coming back here to try out all their other flavours or to grab a quick bite."
Mi Taco Taqueria	3	2019-08-30	This place is a very busy spot downtown and it's the type of place you come and go or take it to go because of how tight the space is. I got the 3 type plate and they're okay. They're not bad but not amazing either (bear in mind, I eat a lot of tacos). Definitely worth trying out if you're already in the area but would I take an hr TTC ride to come here again? Nope.
Mi Taco Taqueria	3	2018-05-30	"Cool decor, nice location, funky music and great service by everyone I interacted with. 

They have a selection of Mexican beer available as well. What better way to have a taco and a beer in hand? 

I ordered the pork burrito bowl, lots to fill you up. It tasted quite good. But nothing to wow me to come back to try it again. The spice level I ordered was medium. I think it's a bit lighter than you think with the spice level. 

My friend ordered the mix of tacos trying 3 different types. He claims the beef was by far the best one. 

I did enjoy the spread of hot sauces available to use on top of your ordered spice level."
Mi Taco Taqueria	1	2019-08-28	"Unfortunate to see such a great and authentic place go down in quality after growth in business. 

I loved Mi Taco when it first opened, it has a real authentic feel to it, amazing flavours of everything. 

I went back today after a couple years out of the neighbourhood and was so excited to go back, I was happy to see how busy they were and they had renovated. 

Unfortunately the quality of taco took a MASSIVE hit. The corn tortilla was mush by the time my food came to me. No seasoning at all. What a disappointing experience and loss in Toronto's Taco scene."
La Carnita	4	2020-03-04	"Initially seen this restaurant off someone's Instagram, and wanted to visit. if you are looking for a vibe with good food this is a great spot. 

They have lunch special, my order was as followed:
Mexican Street Corn - fantastic !
Carne Asada & Achiote chicken tacos - great!
Peanut Butter Cookie I believe it was called - okay

Overall my experince here was very chill and enjoyable. Food was very good. Would recommend for nice chill day/night out."
La Carnita	4	2020-02-08	"I just moved to Toronto from California (born and raised on the Mexican border in San Diego), so I generally have a very strict standard for Mexican food. Overall, I liked what we had at the John st. La Carnita.

Our experience: We arrived at 5:30, which was perfect timing as the masses came shortly after. One thing I noticed right away was the attitude: the hostess seemed a bit ""too cool for school"", as did our server. But they weren't  rude or anything. It just seemed that that was the general attitude in the place. Overall the service was fine, not horrible, but not great.

The food: I really liked the food! We tried 5 tacos: the pollo frito, carne asada, crispy cotija, Baja shrimp, and carnita. Our favorites were the baja shrimp and cotija. We also had the chips and guacamole (just ok), margaritas (small but good!), and tres leches (so good!)

Overall, good experience. May come back since it's so close to the theatre district."
La Carnita	5	2020-01-11	"I tried the tuna ceviche, chicken, and sweet potato taco. They were all amazing! 

I recommend trying the sweet potato taco if you are into a little more spice. The churros was to die for."
La Carnita	3	2019-07-25	"Came here for the first time by luck, on a Tuesday- had to take advantage of their Taco Tuesday special ($28 for 8 hardshell tacos). 

The service here was friendly but a little slower than normal standards. It is also pretty stuffy inside on a hot day, especially on the top floor, but the restaurant itself is a cute, grungy setup. 

I shared the special with my friend, and it came with the perfect amount of toppings to fill the tacos... it's always so satisfying when you're giving the perfect food ratios. The tacos are presented on a tray along with the (""sides"" is what they call it but I think a better word for it is just the taco stuffings). It came with all your taco essentials, including guac. The ground beef also had a bit of a spicy kick to it, and the taco shells had a different crunch to them. Overall, nothing was mind blowing about the tacos. I think it's fun for when you're coming in a pair with someone else, but you'd need to order more with it to fully fill up an empty stomach (good thing my friend and I had a snack before coming). The tacos were presented nicely but if I were to get this for say, takeout, not sure the deal is worth hyping about. 

I'd be open to coming back to try more of their extravagant tacos though :) judging from their menu the prices seemed reasonable for a downtown restaurant."
La Carnita	5	2020-01-05	I would say La Carnita has one of the best tacos around this area ! There are many selections of tacos and two of my favourite ones are the carne asada and the spicy chorizo. The lunch special have never failed to delight me! The deal is $16.99 + tax for two tacos, one appetizer and one dessert which ends up to be a very good deal ! I would say my favourite appetizer to get is the Mexican corn as it has this creamy cheese coated on top of a roasted sweet corn. Definitely a hot spot to come and try!
La Carnita	4	2019-07-04	"This place is HOT as fire! Oh i mean it is soooo good. The interiors are where i should begin at. Stunning yet very simple. Seating at every corner is differently setup yet classy. 

The bar area is also very good.. since we had to wait for the table the server offered us to seat at the bar as the wait time was 45mins. 

The seats were so comfortable and also you can order any food on the menu to the bar area which is even better.. the tacos were fresh and tasty! Ordered fish and chicken 

Not to forget, they also have a 3-4 table patio"
La Carnita	3	2019-11-23	We went on a Friday night and the wait was 40 minutes, so we decided to explore the area near us until we received a text that our table was ready. They led us to our table only to find that people were still sitting there. It took them 15 minutes to figure out another table for us. When we finally sat down, we were given menus and the food here is not cheap at all. We decided to get some chips and salsa to share with 2 tacos each. The salsa came in a tiny container that was barely enough for one person. We waited another 45 minutes for the tacos for them to be cold.
La Carnita	4	2019-05-13	"I actually really like La Carnita since it's decent tacos and convenient - on John and King. Lunch hour is usually slammed since they have a pretty good lunch deal but you should also come on Tuesdays for their taco promo.

I really like their In Cos We Trust and I ALWAYS get their Mexican street corn because it is BOMB. Everything else is pretty decent here but don't forget the damn corn lol"
La Carnita	4	2019-11-14	"One of my fave Mexican places in Toronto. Food and drinks are great and it's a fun vibe. 

Definitely order the Mexican corn to start off with, its delicious and big enough to share. My favourite tacos are the fried chicken with peanut sauce (I believe the pollo frito), the baja shrimp tacos and the carne asada. Three tacos usually fill me up. 

Great to place to eat and hang out, just find the music a bit loud to have a proper convo, but will be coming back here regardless!"
La Carnita	3	2019-11-10	"Casual, small place but conveniently located near the tiff building and Princess of Wales and Royal Alexandra theatres.
Lots of taco options and they do offer 1 or 2 vegan taco options. The shells are corn so gf.
you have to go up some stairs from the street to get in so not sure if there is an accessible entrance.
Make a reservation during TIFF."
La Carnita	4	2019-03-06	"TLDR: Generally, La Carnita is a solid pick for Mexican food if you're in the area and there is no wait. Good Mexican food, not the best in Toronto but a solid choice.

True review: 3.5/5

Atmostphere: I've been here a few times, but quite honestly I've skipped it for the past few years. This is just due to the wait times - there isn't always a wait, but if I'm going to wait for tacos it'll probably not be here. The atmosphere is very dark, which isn't my favourite but otherwise a cozy/industrial look.

Food: 
Overall I'd recommend a shared appetizer and two or three tacos per person depending on your appetite. I myself opted for two. 

1) Chips and dip: This was good! The three dips were great, and it's nice to have a choice. 
2) In cod we trust: This was definitely popular amongst those dining with me. The presentation is good, a bit sauce heavy but overall good.
3) Carne asada taco: Overall good flavours, nothing groundbreaking but no complaints either! 
4) Tuna ceviche tostada: This has consistently been my favourite - good flavours on a cripsy tostada. Definitely recommend!"
La Carnita	5	2019-11-09	"Came here for an early lunch wit my bf. First time in Toronto and this spot was located just around the block from our hotel. 

Pretty quiet when we first came but the music and vibe was definitely attractive. My bf and I sat upstairs which was deceptively larger than I expected. Our waiter/bartender Tahir helped us throughout our time. He was helpful, attentive, and extremely personable. He certainly represented the establishment in a positive way and provided us with great service. Gave us food and drink recommendations when asked and also provided us with additional information on things to do in town.

Food was amazing. We ordered the lunch pre-fixe menu with an additional 2 tacos lol (it was that good). Tacos are HIGHLY recommended, which seem to be their specialty. We also ordered some drinks that were made to the T!!

Certainly recommend this spot for lunch/dinner anytime in Toronto! Don't miss out on a good time."
La Carnita	5	2019-07-26	Came here for lunch today with some coworkers. We all had the lunch prix fixe menu which was a great deal $17/PP. You can choose an appetizer - we all chose the Mexican street corn and it is TO DIE FOR! Absolutely delicious every bite is like a party in your mouth  You also get to choose any two tacos you'd like and if you choose the tuna ceviche it is $1 more. I had the steak and tuna ceviche and it was absolutely delicious. I didn't know the tuna ceviche would come on a hard shell taco if I knew I'd probably order one of the pork tacos as I like soft shell. For dessert we all chose the churros and it was so good and fresh. AH! I definitely need to go back. Can't wait!
La Carnita	4	2018-12-24	"La Carnita is one hip taco joint in the heart of the downtown core. We were a party of five on a Friday night so we had reserved our seats in advance. Our server was super knowledgeable about the menu and really gave us useful insights and advice of what to order.

We ordered the tortilla chips with all three dips to give some variety to our table. The corn salsa was my absolute favourite. They were all quite delicious though. The corn salsa stood out because it was sweet, tangy, and aromatic. It just paired so finely with the chips. Next, we started ordering our tacos.

As per recommended by our server, I got the In Cod We Trust and the Pollo Frito tacos to start. Each tacos was about the size of your hand and was loaded with a sizeable protein and veggie. The Pollo Frito stood out for me because of its slight crunch and exploding flavour from the peanut lime sauce. The cod taco was an interesting combination. I liked the flaky texture of the fish and the fresh vegetables. These tacos really impressed me so I ordered the Carne Asada taco to finish. The steak had an intoxicating smoky flavour which I really liked. 

I had to grab some churros in the end to really tie my meal together. They gave me 3 huge churros along with a sweet dip. Really loved the crispy exterior and tender centre.

Super happy I tried this place out. It is such a great place to dine in on a casual outing!"
La Carnita	3	2019-07-06	"2.5/5 stars. Delicious gourmet tacos, but pricey.

Food: 4/5. Everything I tried was delicious. We started with chips + 3 dips which I would highly recommend.  It came with tomato salsa, corn salsa and guacamole. I also really enjoyed the flavour of my tacos. I got:

- Achiote Chicken. My least favourite but still decent. 
- Crispy Cotija. Basically fried cheese, which you can never go wrong with. 
- Carnita. Pork taco with amazing fixings. This was my absolute favourite. 

We also got a pitcher of one of their daily special drinks, which was a pineapple beer. The glass came rimmed with HEAPS of salt which everyone at my table hated - salt & beer? 


Service & Atmosphere: 2.5/5. Loud & dark space. Hipster in style. Server was nice but visited our table very rarely. There were 5 of us at the table being billed separately. All of our bills were out of order. I had a taco missing from my bill, which got added on to someone else's bill, etc. When we tried to say something to the server she just handed us the debit machine. We ended up figuring out her billing mistakes ourselves and paid each other back the appropriate amounts. 


Value for Money: 2/5. This is where it really falls flat for me. Each MINI taco is about $6.00 each. They can be finished in 2 bites. That's ~$3.00 per bite. They are mini tacos too so you'll need a few of them to feel satisfied."
La Carnita	3	2018-12-16	"There's lots of mixed reviews for this restaurant. Glowing reviews versus one that speak of terrible service. My review errs on the side of the not so good. I'd say 2.5 stars for me.

Are all Mexican restaurants so dim? It seems that the ones I've been to are always so dark and hard to see. In terms of price it's on the pricey side. My friend took me to a food truck in LA and it was either $1 or $1.50 per taco. I suppose you're paying for the atmosphere and sit down service but ~$6/taco is quite the surcharge. I'll give them that the carne asada taco was tasty but in my opinion that still doesn't justify paying so much per taco. They're small so it's not like you're going to have just 1.

I saw horchata on the menu and decided to try it here. It was very watered down. I didn't taste any cinnamon at all either. definitely not worth $4. 

The server told us that they want to be the best fried chicken place in Toronto. I'd say that they have quite a ways to go until they can claim that title. Perhaps it was just the pieces I got but the skin was soft and not crispy. It was also kinda bland without slathering it in sauce. Turns out the dip that we had with the chips was a better accompaniment for the fried chicken instead of the sauce it came with. Go figure. 

That's a lot of negatives that I've listed. The positives are that our server was great and available when we needed her, the atmosphere was good, we were comfortable and didn't feel rushed to finish our meal. Although, paying for our bill took some time. Maybe the person taking payment didn't realize we were ready to pay because our server came back around after about 15 min of us waiting to speed up the process. 

I'd spent almost $30 and left unsatisfied with value for money and felt like I hardly had anything to eat."
La Carnita	4	2020-03-05	Very fun place to have some amazing tacos! I went there with my friends (a group of 6). We made a reservation just in case, I thought we wouldn't need one because it was a Wednesday night, however, the place was so full! That made me so excited! They gave us a nice big table for us. I ordered 3 tocos, La Carnita, Baja Shrimp, In Cod We Trust. All of them are very nice! I am not an expert on Mexican food, but I would like to say that their tacos were on point! Their sauces were cohesive with the components in each taco, offering you some enjoyable bites. I also had their Pilsner beer, which was very interesting and went well with tacos. I thought the price was fair too. The server was very friendly and funny as well. Maybe it would've been better if the music was not too loud because it was a Wednesday night. If that was a Friday night, the loud music would be better. Overall, the food and service were very nice, I was very satisfied!
La Carnita	5	2020-01-26	Came here for lunch, the have an awesome lunch special that you can get  a starter, 2 tacos, and dessert for $16.99 I got the Mexican Street Corn which was amazing, and  a Cod taco and shrimp taco, which were flavourful and spicy. I finished off with a crisp churro and horchata. I highly recxomebt this place
La Carnita	5	2018-12-27	"AmaZing. Literally said wow every bite. This place gets buuuuuuusy and I can understand why. The atmosphere is very cool, kinda dark tho and loud but that's because of people around us. The food was amazing. I can't even make a recommendation because everything was so good. The only think I regretted ordering was the taco with fried chicken, the chicken was just too bite and oily. But the taco came with a peanut lime hot sauce that was to die for. Next time I would ask for grilled chicken on top of that taco order instead of fried. The steak taco was perfection. I wouldn't order more than 2 tacos... me and my friend has one small app (the shrimp), 2 tacos each and the churros and that was absolutely the perfect amount of food. 

Server wasn't really coming to us a lot but it was getting so packed by the time we ordered. 10/10 definitely want to go back."
La Carnita	4	2018-10-10	"I've always wanted to try this taco restaurant and so here we were on a Saturday for a late lunch. 

There are a couple of locations of La Carnita in Toronto.  We went to the John Street location near St. Andrew Station in the Entertainment District.

They have a very reasonably priced prix fixe lunch menu where you can receive a starter, two tacos, and a dessert for $16.99!  (It's available before 4 p.m. each day.)

Walking into the restaurant, I didn't expect it to be so low-key and cozy inside.  I liked the vibe and that they played good music too.  We had made a reservation for our lunch and were given a favourable table facing the bar which meant we got a good view as well.

The food came in a reasonable time and I really liked everything.  The tacos were delish!  (That's important since they are a tacos restaurant after all.)

I liked the In Cod We Trust taco.  It had crispy cod, voltron sauce, lime crema, pickled red cabbage, green apple, and cilantro.  The green apple slices really made it a refreshing and outstanding taco.

I liked the taco tortilla shells too.  That's an important part of having good tacos.

The Mexican Chorizo taco contained chorizo sausage, habanero mayo, cotija cheese, mango salsa, guacamole, chicharrones, and cilantro.  This tasted like beef instead of sausage and tasted spicier to me than expected.

The Achiote Chicken taco had grilled chicken, pineapple & jalapeño salsa, crema, crispy shallots, and cotija cheese.  This was a pretty standard grilled chicken taco.  I liked the pineapple in it.

For my order of two tacos, I had actually chosen the fried chicken taco, but a grilled chicken taco was served.  I called the server over to inform her about the mistake and she made no issue about it.  She immediately went to place in the order for my fried chicken taco and within minutes, it arrived to our table!  I really appreciated that the response to correct the error was so quick and painless and that they didn't charge me extra for the corrected taco too.  Talk about fantastic customer service. 

The Pollo Frito taco had fried chicken thigh, peanut lime hot sauce, crema, salsa fresca, and green cabbage.  This fried chicken taco had really crispy morsels of fried chicken in it.

The Mexican Street Corn was a steamed cob of corn with crema, queso añejo, árbol, and ancho chili powder on it.  This was my first time having Mexican Street Corn!  To be honest though, it's really just sauces and spices drizzled on top of a cob of corn.

The Chips with Dip (guacamole) was pretty good.  The chips were very crispy and reminded me of the ones from Wilbur Mexicana.

For dessert, I chose the Key Lime Pie Paleta while my partner ordered the Churros.  Mmm, I was really impressed with the churros.  They weren't too gigantic and just two churros were about a finger's size each.  There weren't too much sugar on top of it either which I preferred.  I also liked the little bit of caramel sauce that was provided too.  It was just enough to dip the churros into for tasting and not too much to overwhelm the taste of the original churros.

We both liked the Key Lime Pie Paleta (Mexican frozen dessert popsicles).  This was essentially an ice cream pop but it was different from any other ones I've had before since it had a coating on the surface like breadcrumbs or something.  It was really good and the key lime pie flavour was so refreshing after the meaty tacos.

I'm happy to have tried another restaurant in downtown Toronto and especially this popular tacos restaurant!   They serve up solid tacos and the service was really great too."
El Charro	5	2020-03-05	"This place is authentic (in my non mexican opinion) and damn good. I like the creepy washrooms in the basement that add to the ""hole in the wall"" feeling of this restaurant. I think three tacos for 10$ is a good deal. The Mexican sausage and steak were delicious as they had these little pieces of juicy fat. They have different levels of spicy sauces yummm."
El Charro	3	2020-02-03	"Came here the other day with my friend and ordered two tacos. The steak taco ($4) and the baja fish taco ($7.50). The steak taco was good, the meat was cooked nicely and tasted exactly like what I expected. Unfortunately the baja fish taco was a but underwhelming, kinda dry and just average tasting. The baja fish taco wasn't really worth the extra price, despite how big the piece of  fish was. The lime slices were also pretty dry but since it's winter now I can understand how it happened. 

In general the tacos here are just average, give this place a try if you're in the area and trying to quickly satisfy your taco craving."
El Charro	5	2020-03-01	Dropped by to get 3 tacos to go, and it was AMAZING tacos! El Pastor, grilled chicken, and Chorizo. Being a taco lover, this is by far one of the best ones I've tried around town. If you want authentic tacos, this is the place to east of downtown. Their hot sauce are really amazing
El Charro	2	2020-04-18	I added this to my list based on good Yelp reviews. We ordered a takeaway - burrito, quesadilla and corn chips. Overall the food was not fresh, the burrito was average and quesadilla lacked any flavor. Corn chips were overly salty and guac was not fresh. I will try again...
El Charro	5	2019-08-13	"All Ive had so far is the Mangoes but Love it! 

Cant wait to try their other food when I visit."
El Charro	5	2018-12-21	"One of the best Mexican meals I've had in Toronto. Great flavourful tacos for a very reasonable price. Nice home made salsas out front. This place is as close as we have had to the  amazing hole in the wall joints we usually visit in Florida.

We tried most of the tacos they make including El pastor , nopales (cactus), shrimp, steak and chicken. All tasted splendid. Can't wait to try everything else on the menu. 

Highly recommended"
El Charro	2	2019-05-26	Located just across the street from the Broadview TTC station the place is hard to miss. A no frill joint with simple Mexican decor. Based on the reviews ordered the 3 for10$ tacos : Asada, steak and chorizo... I had a lot of hope , but crash landed my expectations with dry and not so fresh tacos. Honestly not at all up to the mark. Wife ordered a tostada with tinga de pollo ( chicken) and was equally disappointed with the serving size and taste. We definitely need to go back to Seven Lives to reset our experience.
El Charro	4	2019-04-19	"Came by last night for some tacos after reading a reddit post (hi, I'm a lurker). Loved the atmosphere - spanish music was blasting and it looks like it was ran by a family. I ordered three tacos (grilled chicken, grilled steak, and pastor (pork with grilled pineapples) and a chicken quesadilla at first. Loved all of it - the chicken was juicy, the steak tasted it was moist and flavourful, and the pastor was just amazing. The chicken quesadilla was different from any quesadilla I ever had. It had the right amount of cheese, lettuce, chicken, sour cream... basically everything a quesadilla should have. It was cooked to perfection! My boyfriend and I finished everything but we were still craving for more so that we had to go back for seconds. 

Overall, great atmosphere and amazing food... definitely recommend to anyone who's looking for authentic Mexican street food! 

Note that this place doesn't have a lot of space for dining. 

P.S. the churros was amazing - not too sweet, just hits the spot."
El Charro	5	2020-02-13	This is the spot. Great tacos. Cool vibe. 100% will be back. Started with the Baja fish taco. Fish was fried well. Crispy on the outside, tender and flaky on the inside. The pickled onions and other toppings were a perfect complement for the hot fried fish. The other three tacos were delicious as well. Kicked up a bit with the ancho y morita salsa was the perfect amount of heat. All cooled down by a jamaica soda (hibiscus). Excellent.
El Charro	5	2019-08-11	"This place is close to home and my go to for great Mexican food. Specifically the tacos... my favourite are the pastor tacos with the grilled pineapple in them - they're fantastic! I always get that along with some chips and delicious guacamole. 

A little pricey (but mostly because I get so much food.....) but worth it."
El Charro	1	2019-12-29	"This place use to be good, but not anymore. The tacos tasted the same, hardly any chicken was found in my ""chicken burrito,"" and $11.95 + tax for a few SMALL pieces of calamari. I won't be returning."
El Charro	3	2018-09-30	"We ordered takeout from here over the weekend and the food was okay. I would consider it mediocre but for the low price of $3-4 per taco you can't really complain. 

Pros:
Low price
Gluten free options (corn tortillas)

Cons:
Not as flavourful as other tacos I have had. 

In all honestly I thought the value was really good but the flavour could be improved.

I ordered the beef and cactus/mushroom taco. They didn't blow me away but they were pretty good for the low price point. 

Would I return?
If I was in the area and needed a gluten and lactose free meal... sure!"
El Charro	5	2019-12-02	Tacos were very tasty and authentic. Reminded me of the street vendor tacos in got in Cabo.
El Charro	5	2019-02-19	We were actually going next door to Ryu's Noodle house and it was so busy we just went next door to El Charro.  My wife is Mexican and it's hard to find good Mexican food but we weren't disappointed.  The food was excellent, the people running the place are Mexican and the service was great.  Best of all the prices were reasonable and the portions were generous.  We will be returning here in the future, if you're looking for authentic Mexican food I would highly recommend this place.  No tipping required since you order, you get your food and then drop off your dishes which really saves you money as well.  Definitely check it out.
El Charro	2	2018-08-27	"Had an appointment across the street so I saw this Mexican place and decided to try it out. It's very nicely decorated -- vibrant colours, a mural, and lots of Mexican decor. 

I decided to go with a veggie burrito as I am vegetarian, which came up to $9 flat. I was told at the cash that it's 10% off if you pay with cash (not sure if that's an everyday thing but at least I know for next time). Anyways, I was served right away and I was in and out within five minutes I'd say. The burrito itself was not the greatest--pretty bland compared to other veggie burritos I've eaten (and I eat a lot of them lol). I've also never had a burrito with broccoli, cauliflower and carrots in it so this was a first for me . Honestly tasted like I had some type of Asian stirfry in my burrito which really threw me off. Guacamole is supposed to be included but I couldn't even taste it . To be honest I didn't finish a quarter the burrito because I just didn't enjoy it at all. A piece of the cauliflower actually fell on the ground by accident there was a bunch of pigeons around me that really enjoyed it lol  

Would I come back? Probably not. If I was in the area I'd be open to trying something else on the menu because I see a lot of great reviews but I don't see myself ever coming out of my way to come here again."
El Charro	1	2019-11-26	Can't comment on the food as I NEVER GOT MY ORDER. I ordered a shrimp burrito and waited 30 minutes. I had an appointment so I couldn't wait anymore; I asked the cashier if my order was almost ready and after looking through a pile of past orders I saw him throw the shrimp on the grill. I asked them to forget about it as really had to go. They reimbursed me cash and I left annoyed that I never ate my food and was starving. I'm not sure how they somehow forgot about my order when I was sitting right there in front of them waiting for 30 minutes! I don't think I'll give it another shot...
El Charro	3	2019-09-30	The quality is quite good but even after $15-20 you will leave hungry because the portions are way too small
El Charro	5	2017-05-10	"Interesting when a place has been near you, yet u never discovered it..
Okay, Maybe not that interesting...
Friendly staff, terrific tacos.
Also tried huevaches (?), w chicken, really messy, also good."
El Charro	5	2017-10-18	"This tiny food joint is the absolute cutest! 

My boyfriend actually recommended this place after seeing a friend posted a Snapchat story about these amazing rose mangos! 

When we arrived we were so fascinated with all the Mexican the decour, it was absolutely authentic. We just ordered the rose mangos so I can't comment on the actual food like the tacos and burritos that they also sell. 

The rose mangos were really delicious but quite messy to eat it's not something that you can walk around and eat. You have to sit down and enjoy it. 

Ps: make sure you grab a lot of napkins while eating this."
El Charro	4	2017-09-19	"Mexican food done right! 

The meat was cooked so well, juicy and flavourful. The caramelized onions added another dimension of great flavour.  We also got guac and chips for $4.50 very good as well. 

To those who complain about waiting for food.. you are only waiting because they are making it fresh. It's not like chipotle where it sits there for what could be hours.

Good prices, good food!"
Chula Taberna Mexicana	4	2020-01-21	"My first time coming to Chula Taberna Mexicana and let's just say I was not disappointed! Arrived at 6:30 made reservation but at round that time you don't need one as there was a lot of available tables still. But if you are comming later on after 7:30 do make reservations from what I saw  it does pack up.

Monday special, who can say no to Margarita Monday's! They are 5$ each with 1.5 oz inside each drink. Do drink responsibly because they taste real good.

The service there was quick and efficient . Our server always came back to check up  on us, refilled our water without asking and asked us if we wanted another drink as we were nearing the end of it. But I saw some hot sauces at most of the other tables but not ours and I thought it was weird. 

Ambience was nice the lights were not so bright and slightly dimmed. You can hear the music but it wasn't too loud. So if you brought a date here you guys will be able to hear each other. Space was not crammed. Did not get to checkout the outdoor patio as it was winter. 

Food:  
Apps: 
Fubdido de cactus -baked cactus dip 3/5 
Ceviche De Cameron- shrimp ceviche 5/5 
^ highly recommend 

Tacos :
Cameron picante -spicy butterflied Shrimp 4.5/5
Pescado borracho -beer battered haddock 3/5 

Dessert: 
Helado con churros- churros Sundae 5/5 
^my favourite dessert highly recommend 

Overall tacos here are amazing a must  try if you are ever in the area. Even if you arent it's definetly  worth the drive down. Easy parking on the street free after 6 pm! 
 
Can't wait to come back on a Thursday for 1/2 price tequila shots!"
Chula Taberna Mexicana	4	2020-01-10	"Had a nice Friday dinner upstairs (this place has 2 levels, bottom is more bar styled). We ordered the tequila flight

 Tromba Family: Blanco + Reposado + Anejo $13

 Comes with 3 tequilas and spiced orange and lime to start. It came in a cool looking plank board and shots served in dip cups. Very unique. 

I ordered the pork belly to start (my favourite dish of the night- belly was fatty and crispy)

, shrimp tacos (delicate but full of taste) Camarón Picante - Spicy Butterflied Shrimp

citrus mayo + cucumber + pico + corn + radish + pickled onion + jalapeño $7

 and the flank steak plate: CARNE ASADA - GRILLED FLANK STEAK(chimichurri + creamy Mexican street corn + queso fresco + blue corn chips) $23

 All the food was great, the hot sauce comes with big punches. There's also a lot of specials during the week so we will be coming back for more ! There is also a hot sauce challenge...if you're into that crazy life definitely check this place out !"
Chula Taberna Mexicana	4	2020-05-12	Came to try this place for a chill birthday dinner- I would say it was worth the long wait on a Saturday. All the dishes are well seasoned and thought out, not to mention the guacamole portion was well worth paid for! However, I would highly recommend the curry fish- perfect for those who enjoy spicy food.
Chula Taberna Mexicana	3	2019-11-11	"We decided to drop by on a late Saturday night, the place was busy but we were lucky to wait only 15 minutes. We ordered the Street Corn, Beer Battered Haddock Tacos, Crispy General Tao Tacos, BBQ Beef Brisket Taco and Pork Shoulder Burrito. 

The Street Corn came out - and was absolutely delicious! The cream sauce on top was the perfect sauce for it. 
When the tacos came out, the Crispy General Tao Taco's sauce seemed to have drenched all the other ones as well, so the tacos were very soggy, and didnt leave much of an impression. Out of the three the Haddock was definitely the best.  Lastly, we the burrito came out, and that was delicious. The salsa, the rice, and meat were so tender it came together perfectly. Overall we enjoyed our dinner at Chula, and would probably come back to check it out in the summer on their patio. We found the indoor restaurant to be a bit cramped (especially the front of the house)."
Chula Taberna Mexicana	4	2019-08-25	"I decided to check this place out during my never ending taco obsession phase. The patio looks pretty with twinkling lights and a mini fire pit on one of the middle tables. I came on 2 separate occasions & Chula did not disappoint! Both times I had the fried calamari appetizer, shrimp, fish & chicken tacos. The amount of food was filling because usually I could probably eat like 8 tacos and still be hungry. I'm not a fan of the location so I wouldn't go out of my way to visit, but I'd definitely come back if I were in the area. 

Tip: Try to secure the spot with the mini fire table 

Service: 4/5
Presentation: 4/5
Taste: 4/5
Price: 4/5
Ambiance: 4/5
Overall: 4/5"
Chula Taberna Mexicana	3	2019-10-06	"Friendly service and accommodated a baby no problem on busy Sunday evening.

I tried 3 types of tacos and the standout was the fish taco for me. I absolutely loved my margarita with the star anise spice in it. Must try!
The calamari was pretty weak, very small portions and fried batter falling off.

I would return to try a burrito, they looked massive."
Chula Taberna Mexicana	4	2019-07-20	"I thought the food was good. Price was good too. Removed a star for non-disclosure of spicyness levels. But in fairness we didn't ask lol. We couldn't finish one of the tacos because it was so spicy it gave my bf heartburn. 

I would come back, but for sure consult with your server to ask about how much kick is in the food!"
Chula Taberna Mexicana	4	2019-08-09	Every now and then I have a food craze and lately it's been for Mexican food  I love everything about this place , from the ambience to the food presentation and taste. On Sundays they have bottomless tacos which is what I had along with a passion fruit frozen margarita  I will definitely be back! $$ ~
Chula Taberna Mexicana	4	2019-06-19	Been here a few times and it's a great place with good vibes. The patio is very nice and spacious. On my most recent visit, we ordered chips with guac, carnita tacos and chorizo burrito bowl. Though I think they messed up my order and gave me a chicken burrito bowl instead. I didn't mind and bother telling the waiter but the chicken was overcooked and a bit dry. The carnita tacos were very good though. They were quite busy on a Wednesday afternoon with only one waiter working until I was leaving, they had another waiter starting their shift. Overall, it's a good place with good food. I'll definitely come at night to see how their patio is at night.
Chula Taberna Mexicana	3	2019-08-02	"I came here with a friend and ordered the beef and the fish tacos. The food was pretty good, but the restaurant was quite busy so the food took a long time to arrive. The restaurant was also nicely decorated and the rooftop area was very nice.

Unfortunately the service was pretty bad, and we waited over 15 minutes just to order. Probably won't be returning because of this."
Chula Taberna Mexicana	5	2019-03-03	"Awesome food. Great friendly staff. 

Highly recommend the fish tacos. 

If you are in the mood for Mexican and are in the area you won't find better."
Chula Taberna Mexicana	2	2019-07-27	"When did Gerrard and Jones become a popular destination? Good on it. 

Quick summary:

- nice rooftop patio
- I had slowish service
- Food was good. We had a churizo bowl and the ceviche. Both were solid. I didn't notice anything special about the menu. Standard upper-middle level Mexican foods. 
- Drinks ok (cider + tequila based fruity blend).
- overpriced. Why is Mexican food so expensive in Toronto? It's mostly bloody rice, tomatoes, lettuce, avo, standard meats.
- The staff was decent not great but it was busy hence the pressure of Friday night at play. 
- Personally I wouldn't go back at that pricing but if you don't mind that you may like the food. 

2/5 maybe 2.5. 

Tears for Mcguiggan's."
Chula Taberna Mexicana	5	2019-07-31	"Food was amazing. Things that stood out and a definite must try were the: ""Mexican street corn, the cactus dip (best item on menu imo), the zucchini fritters and the chicken enchilada. The patio is super cute and great for just chilling with friends and having some yummy cocktails. Loved the vast tequila selection as well!"
Chula Taberna Mexicana	3	2020-01-31	I forgot, the second time I went, how bad the green curry is and got it again.  Damn it.
Chula Taberna Mexicana	4	2019-09-21	If you have a love for anything Spanish (Cuban/Mexican) than this little spot will warm your heart instantly, transporting you back in time to your last visit to either of these countries with an intimate patio, unique versions of Mojitos & some kick-ass taco's or burritos! We came here to celebrate a very special day, a turning point in my life. I'll definitely be back, I loved the atmosphere & the staff were friendly & that's a great testament to the overall great customer service that I love! Well done Chula!
Chula Taberna Mexicana	5	2019-08-18	I came here with my bf after work one day and sat in the patio or back.   Really liked the corn, the dishes we got had more acidity I really like that flavor.   I wanted to sit there all day but I'll just come back another day.
Chula Taberna Mexicana	2	2018-12-23	"I came last summer and had an amazing dinner, I remembered the tacos to be rich in flavour and super affordable which was a big stand out to me since a lot of other taco places that charge upwards of $7/8 per taco. I dare to say that this WAS my favourite taco place at the time.

I came back this month for the first time in nearly a year and things were a lot different. For Tacos, I ordered the Biztec de Carne and the Carnita and they ended up tasting exactly the same, which was disappointing and weird since they have a lot of different ingredients altogether. Also there seemed to be a lot of liquid in the taco filling because halfway through eating one of my tacos it fell apart due to the moisture. Also, in all of the tacos, there seemed to be this weird crunchy/salty/sweet ingredient that I couldn't tell what it was. It was really odd, and gave the tacos a weird flavour/texture profile. This was not the same as what I ate a year ago, and they seemed to be more expensive than I remembered.

The one thing that stayed consistent however was their amazing Churro Sundae - everyone in the restaurant seemed to be ordering this. Their Churros were seasoned and cooked perfectly, and the caramel ice cream pairs perfectly - its one of the best churro desserts in the city in my opinion, and would come back just for this."
Chula Taberna Mexicana	4	2019-07-02	Decided to try a new Mexican restaurant and came across Chula. When we arrived we looked for a spot on the patio for 3 people, the wait was about 45 minutes as the patio is quite small. There was lots of room on the inside but we wanted to enjoy the summer air. After we were seated the server came over and explained the menu, Our party ordered the enchiladas, the shrimp tacos and the fundido dip and the burrito bowl as recommended by other yelpers. The most memorable dish was the enchiladas and the fundido dip. The burrito bowl was a bit bland tasting for us and we felt like it needed a bit more flavor as for the tacos as well. The fundido dip was loaded with cheese and no complaints about that, the Shrimp tacos also lacked a bit of flavor and was only sub par. Overall the patio experience was great ! The service could be picked up a little as some things were slow like receiving the bill, but otherwise great little Mexican restaurant.
Chula Taberna Mexicana	4	2019-12-10	I went back here and had the zucchini fritters and brisket burrito. Both were really good! I want to try the tacos again, but loved the burrito.
Chula Taberna Mexicana	4	2018-03-04	"This is a place that deserves between 3.5 and 4 stars overall. The service is quick and friendly and the food that we tried can stand on it's own. 

Formerly known as McGugan's, this place traded the whiskey for tequila, haggis balls for guacamole, and bangers & mash for tacos.

I met up with a friend at Chula on a Tuesday and there wasn't a big dinner rush which was fine by me.

While waiting for my friend, the server ever so smoothly offered me some guac and chips. The fresh home-style chips was nice and held up against the tart and creamy guac.

Their drink menu is quite expansive and we decided to start our night off with a margarita. They have some interesting margarita mixes and we chose one the humo grande (tequila and whiskey) and I recommended the mami chula (tequila and champagne) to my friend. They offer a pretty expansive beer and cocktail menu as well.

She really loved the bubbly champagne surprise in her margarita and I found the blend of tequila and whiskey was appropriate which did not lead to any bad decisions later in the night haha.

I was only feeling peckish so I ordered the Mexican street corn and the smoked Mexican wings. I found that the corn didn't live up to my expectations so probably recommend you have this during the height of corn season when the produce itself is better. I really enjoyed the smokey Mexican wings. It was a good portion of 5 whole wings (drumstick, wing, and tip) that were not breaded. Half of them came sauced with chipotle glaze while the other was a habanero citrus dry rub. Both offered toned down levels of heat from the normally fiery peppers. It really hit the spot.

My friend was pleasantly surprized by her chicken enchilada and didn't leave a single crumb on her plate.

We stayed to chat whilst enjoying our food and rink. The room buzz wasn't too loud and there isn't a need to shout or scream across the table to be heard on a weekday.

I think that Chula is a welcome addition to this Gerrard St. neighbourhood."
MEXITACO	5	2020-03-07	"I thought this place was a hidden gem but apparently pretty well known to bunch of my Instagram friends!

My husband and I ordered plantains, grilled fish tacos, steak tacos, burrito, ceviche (it was amazing!!) and a sangria- all was perfect and we paid under CAD$70 including gratuity.

Everything we had was simple but flavorful, nothing was overdone. Service was friendly- our server even told us be used to be a regular at the restaurant and asked for a job there because he loved the food so much. How cute is that?! We will definitely come back!"
MEXITACO	3	2020-02-10	"I've been to Mexitaco a couple of times now and they've been good enough. The servers are friendly but not as attentive as I'd like, make sure to really confirm what you've ordered to ensure nothing has been missed and if something doesn't arrive soon, check with your server because it probably wasn't punched in. The atmosphere is fun but small, and busy on weekends, so make reservations if you have a group. 

The nachos with added guacamole is good but don't expect much cheese happening with these, it's mostly tomatoes, onions, and sour cream; the added guacamole really helps, but wish their guacamole was thicker because it's very slurry like.

The elote was not good here. It didn't look or taste like it was actually grilled, plus the mayonnaise and shredded cheese combination grossed me out. I've tried other Mexican style street corn that are much better.

Out of the tacos I've tried, the baja fish is my favourite, followed by the carne asada. I find their tacos are on the drier side so make sure to really use the supplied limes, salsa, and hot sauce provided after you order. I would not recommend the baja calamari taco, it was 3 sad tiny battered calamari rings (like the sad frozen ones) that were also chewy and flavourless. 

The frozen margarita with added Coronita was unexpectedly salty, so I would not recommend. Try their Pina Colada instead - can be a hit or miss.

We've tried other things on the menu that are okay but this is what we will typically order every time and basically what not to order for next time."
MEXITACO	5	2020-02-01	"Best Mexican spot hands down in GTA.  
Been to pretty much every spot and the dot compare taste wise and price wise.   
Very authentic very fresh.  
Comparable to the Mexican food I've had in Mexico and while I live veer in NJ.  (The average  Mexican spot in NJ destroys anything in Toronto except this place)

Worth going.   Deserves 5 stars honestly. 




Oh the fried ice cream was legIt fantastic."
MEXITACO	3	2019-09-19	"I really had high hopes after Reading the other reviews on yelp. Perhaps my review is a little muddied from the fact that I just returned from Mexico City. Nonetheless I found the food to be tasteful, but I'm afraid most of the food we ordered-  the ceviche and the soup was pre- frozen and de thawed to serve. 

Granted we did come in on Monday evening and it was quite dead so I don't think they had a full kitchen working that night. I think I might return one more time on the weekend or a Friday night to see if the service and the food is anymore fresh."
MEXITACO	4	2018-12-15	"My go to Mexican eat-in restaurant. Nice and cozy. 

We ordered the following:
1. Carne Asada Platter. 8/10. Plate was a good portion for one person, definitely if you are hungry. Comes with marinated grilled beef topped with a jalepeno, side of grilled onion, beans, guac & 5 corn tortillas. The beef, I wish was cooked a bit more rare. It was a bit tough to cut through. 

2.  TACOS: 
- Baja fish Taco 10/10. The fish was nicely fried in a batter. My fave out of all the tacos tried.
- Tacos de Chorizo 10/10. The spicy chopped sausage was bomb!
- Tacos de Tinga 8/10. Flavour was a bit off for me. The chicken was nicely cooked though.

3. Alcohol - Mangonada - 10/10. Absolutely delicious!!

Service was great. Food was served nice and hot. Will be coming back! :)"
MEXITACO	3	2019-02-11	"A few points:

We got:

-grilled fish tacos 
-bean/cheese quesadilla 
-chicken quesadilla 
-beef tacos
-beef burrito 
-fried plantain 
-churro
-4 beers/$10 Sunday deal

3 stars because the portions are on the small side for what you pay. One hungry person will need at least two orders of tacos plus a side to fill them up. Service was ok but seemed a bit disinterested. 

The churro was very very good. I recommend for desert. That was probably the dish that stood out the most. 

The venue itself is nicely designed and a cool hangout spot. I'm happy to have a place like this in the neighbourhood especially because there are not a ton of sit down Mexican restaurants in the east end. They definitely fill a niche. Food is fine but nothing to write home about. Worth a try but it won't knock you off your feet. You will be annoyed by the lack of parking but not much one can do about that."
MEXITACO	5	2019-07-06	"Great: food, ambiance and the staff's attitude
Could be better: The service 

The food here is excellent. Our favourite was the churros--best I've ever had and large enough to share with 2-3 people. The fajitas and quesadilla were perfect and made with fresh ingredients. Guacamole was tasty, but more creamy rather than chunky. For a drink, I tried the mango mojito and it was delicious, but the alcohol seemed to be light and a double shot would be recommended.

I saw some people share the portions were small and menu items expensive, but need to point out the food here is shareable and ordering multiple items for the table is encouraged. Two tacos (under $10) is pretty filling for an average person, especially if you get an appetizer to share with someone.

The staff is very nice and accommodating, but it did take some time for orders to be taken, food to come, plates be cleared, etc., so expect to take your time while here and not a fast meal."
MEXITACO	3	2019-11-10	"Been visiting this place since it was on Bloor, so I'm obviously a fan. 

The food is excellent, and continues to be so, with the exception of the guacamole. It's very smooth and soft, not chunky at all. I find it to be overly citrusy, with lack of garlic taste. Reminds me of store bought super bright green guacamole that never seems to go bad . Skip the guac, and just smash an avocado at home. Everything else I've tried here has been great (tacos, tostadas).

The service has never been amazing, but has declined significantly. On my last visit, we weren't given water until 20 minutes after we were seated. Cocktails took a whopping 30 minutes. It felt awkward and kinda embarassing to try to emphatically wave down the uninterested server. After food was brought out, we weren't checked on until, once again, I found myself waving down server for our bill.

Long story short, when I received the bill, I expressed my concern with the service. The explanation honestly pissed me off. They said the service is messed up because they have too many Uber eats orders. I told him you can't have Uber eats impacting your dine in patrons, but apparently you can. We live in a new world where restaurants can probably survive off of online orders. Either way, waiting 20 minutes for water isn't an Uber issue."
MEXITACO	2	2019-09-25	"This has been a regular lunch spot for me this past year though I won't be returning . 

Last visit lunch two other tables only 2 waiters .

Wine ordered was old and smelled like vinegar.

Ordered apps nachos with guacamole and beans .

Both bowls for dips were still wet and beans tasted like dish soap .

Ordered water with ice did not ever arrive . Taco was okay but not what it used to be .

Cheese in a taco being extra at a Mexican restaurant is wired to me as well .

I wish they kept the same service quality as when they opened . 

We won't be going back ."
MEXITACO	4	2020-02-01	"I've been wanting to try this spot for over a year and we finally went last Saturday.
The atmosphere is so warm and welcoming. Its just the perfect spot for a winter's night to pretend you're on vacation! 
The people are so friendly and accommodating. We didn't have reservations but lucked out with a table by the window, even though the place was nearly full. The service was  just right - friendly and just the right speed.
The food was really good. There were four of us, each trying a selection of tacos. Reviews around the table were all positive. I had the grilled fish taco and shrimp taco - so good! 
We will go again for sure!"
MEXITACO	4	2019-05-09	"One of the better mexican restaurants on the east side! Ordered the tacos al pastor, they were very good and cheap!! the burrito wasn't the best and definitely must try the nachos and churros! The add on for the guac was definitely worth it!  
Also the drinks were good and decently priced!"
MEXITACO	4	2018-12-11	I read a lot of positive reviews of this restaurant. They have excellent selection of authentic Mexican food. The sauces are great. The staff are very friendly. Price reasonable. I loved their churros. We parked at McDonald 'coz we can't find a parking place. Before you leave, don't forget to use the washroom, they have a very cute and interesting sink.
MEXITACO	2	2019-07-22	"This was the worst $32 I ever spent ... 
soggy & flavourless. Was very excited to try this place but I don't think I will be returning or ordering again in the future. Disappointed :("
MEXITACO	5	2020-01-01	I've been meaning to check out MEXITACO for some time now, and finally did today. The food and atmosphere are as good as others have written. I had the Shrimp Ceviche Tostada and the Tacos al Pastor. Both dishes were great, however the Ceviche was definitely the star; it was so flavourful and refreshing. Also the customer service was on-point, as our server was very attentive. I think I've found me new favourite spot for Mexican food!
MEXITACO	2	2019-03-02	"Ordered take out on a Saturday evening; Chicken Wings ($12.99), Burrito De Carne Asada ($12.99), and the Quesadillas De Tinga ($8.99). Staff were not overly friendly, ignoring me upon entry, servicing a walk-in couple before me, and assuming I was a food delivery courier.... The portions were all small, especially the SIX wings, yes only 6, which tasted OK. The burrito was one of the worst I've had in the city, lacking any flavour, and the Quesadillas was average. The sour cream that came with the Quesadillas was also questionable as it tasted, and had the consistency of being watered down. At a $25 price point this meal might have garnered 3 stars.

I will never return.

Aside: I noticed they charge $8.50 for pints which I thought was pricey. For reference The Keg charges the same price their craft beer selection."
MEXITACO	4	2018-08-30	"we came on a special night where there were mexican performers singing and dancing.  

the food here is legit and tastes quite good.  the nachos reminded my wife of mexico... 

not the typical chips you get from supermarkets.. but freshly fried corn nachos made in house.   ingredients were fresh.   This is now my go to place if i am craving Mexican."
MEXITACO	4	2017-08-18	"It's hard to find good quality Mexican food in Toronto.  It's even harder to find a place that isn't downtown.  Well thankfully a good friend mentioned this place had moved and was now in the east end.  Blink and you might miss it but it's on the corner of Victoria Park and St Clair (right across the No Frills).  

It's small inside but they pack in a lot of tables.  Went on a Friday night and the place was jumping jumping.  As the night wore on it just got busier (apparently around 8-9pm there is a show Friday nights).  We were finished eating by that time and stayed a bit to see if started but we ended up leaving as we didn't want to hog the table when others needed it.

I wasn't super hungry so I ordered the beer battered shrimp tacos and the baha fish tacos (you get 2 of each).  They were delicious.  No greasy, not bland, just delicious.  The owners/staff are from what I have heard are Mexican.  So they know what they are cooking.  

The atmosphere is lively, the service is friendly and the food is GREAT.  I will definitely add this as one of my regular rotations of deliciousness"
MEXITACO	5	2018-07-11	AMAZING TACOS!!! I love Mexican food, so when we passed this location on VP one evening, my boyfriend and I decided to try it out on a whim. It was a Tuesday evening and the place was not busy at all. The place is decorated with modest but cute decorations. The washroom downstairs is clean and has the coolest sinks (see picture). I ordered the beer-battered fish taco option that was a little pricier for only one taco, as well as the grilled fish taco option that came with two for a lesser price. All were so amazing; just spot on with the authentic flavours and perfect cook. The servers are super smiley and knowledgeable about the menu. Only thing to comment on is the lack of parking--we had a hard time parking our huge pick-up. Other than that, I would definitely recommend this place!
MEXITACO	4	2018-06-06	"A somewhat limited review since I came in during a work lunch break (no drinks) and I went for the fajita platter (Texmex) rather than possibly more authentic Mexican items on the menu.

Though the fajita platter is fairly straightforward and hard to screw up, I have to say that the meat had better seasoning on it (likely pre-marinated) than other places I've had it at. The veggies and onions also likely had prep in advance, as they were more slow cooked and deliciously caramelised than other places as well. I went with the steak which was pretty good quality, and the two others I was with went for the chicken which was a platter for two. A tip that the platter for two will save you a few bucks rather than ordering two fajita entrees separately.

Another positive aspect was having authentic and spicy salsas compared to Pace-type chunky salsas.

Not much else to report on, but we also shared the churros. Since we were sharing, they offered to prepare them in smaller 6 pieces rather than the 2 long ones which was a nice gesture (easier to split with 3 people). They also did bill splitting with no issue, which included the single churro order 3 ways, and splitting the fajitas for 2 on two separate bills. 

So far, so good, and looking forward to trying other things."
MEXITACO	5	2019-02-15	"Yum, what else u wanna know.

Good authentic food,  fresh, delicious,  good flavor and good beers too!
 Try it"
La Chingada	5	2020-02-12	"Best staff and best tacos!!!!  Mikaela and Myles were just EXCELLENT and ensured that I (a person who tastes soap in cilantro) was well taken care of.  Come here on a Wednesday night, like we did, and you will get the most out of the excellent customer service. 
A+++!"
La Chingada	3	2019-09-14	"Good tacos but Seven Lives is still King. Expensive tho, about $70 with 2 drinks and tax and tip. Not sure id be hurrying to go back. 

I'd check out Good Hombres, Gus Taqueria, and Seven Lives first."
La Chingada	4	2019-11-28	"Recently stopped by on a Sunday, and then retaliated that is been here earlier this year as well haha. Both times were similar in experience - meaning good service and good food. The margaritas are yummy and proper. The decor is bright and fun. When we came most recently it was a bit slow and close to kitchen closing so they gave us extra meat on our platter - which I thought was nice. Their churros are delicious - crisp on the outside and soft inside served with spiced hot chocolate to dip. The chorizo empanadas were also top notch and made fresh to order.  
If I'm ever there when it's not freezing out then I'd like to sit on their patio."
La Chingada	4	2019-09-10	"We came here for dinner and had a really positive experience. We ordered the platter and two tacos to share. Both of our tacos were great and the platter had three types of meat (two different pork and beef which did contain gluten) and different vegetables and sides for us to put on our corn tortillas. 

We found this to be plenty of food for two people and it was really good.

The Service was a little on the slow side but if you don't mind waiting, it's definitely worth checking out."
La Chingada	5	2019-07-06	"Big ass tacos. Do I need to say anything else?

I've had a lot of tacos around the city and these are definitely the biggest. Around $6.50ea, I was reluctant to buy 2 until they arrived. I wasn't sure I'd finish them. Delicious and stuff with toppings that will probably fall out of the taco. 

They also give you a couple different hot sauces, mild, med and hot to test out with your meal. 

They also have Taco Tuesday, because of course they do."
La Chingada	4	2019-05-21	"Came here with a group of friends (on the recommendation of friends) and was not disappointed!  They have recently opened back in February and already are a big hit.

They don't take reservations (at least not when we went, not sure if they do now, seeing how busy this place is).

The ingredients they use are top quality and they make their own tortillas.  I ordered the fish tacos  - blackened basa, slaw for that crunchy texture and a smokey chipotle mayo that gives its that final punch of flavour for your taste buds.  Ordered a bunch of churros for the table - soft and crispy, drizzled with powdered sugar and dulce de leche.  If people weren't around I'd probably lick the plate...but i have class (well, at least when I go out and know people are watching me...lol)

The decor is fun - cool murals on the walls, the vibe is fun and the service is great!  Too bad I don't live closer."
La Chingada	4	2019-06-10	"Perfect Sunday to check out their back patio which is so sweet! (Unfortunately, it being garbage pick up in the AM, like most areas in Toronto it smelt a little of garage) 

Tried the Chips n' Salsa ($10) 
Mexican Street Corn ($7) (TIP I always use a knife, so I don't get it all over my face / clothes) 
Barboca Taco ($6.50)
Fish Taco $7
And the Pastor Huarache $8

Would definitely recommend the tacos and apps! Personal favourite was the barboca & Chips n Salsa (includes a small bowl of guac.) We enjoyed everything and will be back."
La Chingada	4	2019-07-11	"I really wanted to love this place fully because the staff are so nice, and the patio was so cute and uniquely coloured and designed. But, there was a slightly wafting smell of garbage surrounding the patio that made the experience slightly unappetizing. We could have moved inside but it was such a nice day for the shaded patio. 

We ordered the DIY platter; wish we had just ordered the pre-made tacos which looked a lot more appealing. It was a decent amount of food for two, but there was something lacking in seasoning in the meat. The sauces were okay, but nothing special to add that extra bit of flavour. I also didn't love the shells. Drinks were good. I probably wouldn't go back though."
La Chingada	5	2019-02-25	"La Chingada is located on the north side of Dundas just east of Dovercourt.

It's not often I have the opportunity of going to soft openings of places that aren't officially open yet.  I was searching for a place to grab a quick small bite and have a drink before going to the Stephen Bulger Gallery just down the street.  I didn't find much interesting between Gladstone and Dovercourt so I decided to walk a bit further east and I see ""Mexican street food"".  Hello, harbor in the storm.

So I discovered that La Chingada has only opened 5 days ago and not even officially yet.  Their official opening is this Friday (March 1st).  I really had only about half an hour to order, eat and get to our event so I thought this was a perfect spot.  

I'll admit that I too am spoiled by Mexican food from southern California.  It's a snob thing kind of how my wife scoffs at things like the Olive Garden or Pizza Hut Italian Bistro trying to pass off their cuisine as Italian.  I get it.  People are used to places that serve the best of the best and once they are spoiled it's hard to dial things back to whatever may be available to us.  In this case, La Chingada is not only north of Bloor, north of the US border but also north of the Mexican border as well.  Let me just say that regardless of geography this place serves some of the best tacos I've ever had the opportunity of tasting.

So while I had ordered 6 different tacos this was within 2 visits within 3 hours of each other.  Honestly I wasn't planning on going back so soon but one of my friends that wasn't with my other friend and I the first time wanted to give it a try after I had spoken just going there.

The first visit I had ordered the barbacoa, tinga de pollo, carnitas and chorizo.  The barbacoa and chicken were my friend's order but I had a taste of the barbacoa and the beef was rich and full of flavor.  I loved the compliment of the tangy queso fresca that topped it as well.

My plate consisted of the carnitas and the chorizo.  Chorizo is normally my favorite filling and while it was a solid savory choice I had to give it up to what I thought was the true champion of the evening which was the carnitas.  I loved the bit of crisp to the pulled pork and the meat was very juicy but not wet.  Does that even make sense?  I normally really enjoy  carnitas but these were beyond that. These were without a doubt the best carnitas I've had.  My wife makes carnitas and thankfully, she won't read this review.  It's ok because we'll end up coming here sometime soon and she'll get to try them and I won't need to say anything.  It's sort of the equivalent of watching a movie and my wife saying wow, that actress is so pretty.  Ya, I just won't answer because it's a trap.

The second visit my friend that didn't come the first time ordered the chicharrone.  These weren't the kind of pork rinds you find in a plastic bag at the grocery store chip aisle.  Dang these were huge pieces of rind.  I had to break pieces apart because they were so big.  The rinds came with tomatoes, a green salsa and some guacamole.

For my second round I had ended up ordering the blackened fish and carne asada.  The fish was very good, grilled with a flaky texture.  I forgot to ask what fish they used but it wasn't a strong flavor and a lighter fish.  The carne asada was also very good and very filling.

The portions here seem quite generous but the quality and mix of flavors are all pretty well balanced.  I liked the variety, presentation, flavors and overall quality of the food here.  The tortillas are real deal corn tortillas with a dense integrity.  There's no need to ""double up"" since they aren't thin and won't disintegrate because of the filling.  These tacos although they are quite filled (some filling may fall out) I found kept their shape and they didn't fall apart and weren't awkward.  Being able to pick them up and eat them to me is a huge plus.  If you've been to other places perhaps you'll know what I mean when I say sometimes you just can't do that but here it's all good.

Both times we had the same server and both times she was very friendly and helpful.  I think it was just serendipity coming across La Chingada while looking for a place to eat.  It's not everyday I come across places like this by just walking 2 blocks looking for something."
La Chingada	4	2019-11-24	"Went here for ayce tacos Thursdays ($19.95), only available until end of November I believe 

Food (4/5): very good tacos that were way better than I expected for ayce. They were proper really good restaurant quality tacos! I love that they used corn tortillas and were generous with the filling! I tried all taco flavors and recommend the tinga de pollo, chorizo, barbacua and carnitas 

Price (5/5): ayce tacos at this price point is a STEAL. 

Service (3/5): the waiter deserves 5/5, he was super attentive and pleasant throughout the course of our meal. However we waited 45 min to an hour for our first tacos to come out from the kitchen. Tacos came out at a reasonable pace after that but the initial wait was painful.

Ambiance (3.5/5): very clean, cozy spot in Trinity bellwoods. The mural on the wall was a nice touch"
La Chingada	4	2019-04-21	"Service was excellent, one woman was serving the whole place and she did an amazing job. Kudos to her!

Space is nice, tables far apart, two levels. Definitely have to dock points for the bathrooms. The women washroom stalls swing inwards, and with the placement of the toilet paper dispenser and the toilet, I could barely get my pregnant belly into the stall, so I can't imagine if you're a larger woman or a more-pregnant person...not very accessible.  

We had the queso, which was really delicious, but sadly only came with three tortillas - the Jen Agg rule is to not be a dick and give a number divisible by the group at the table (so we should have gotten 4). I have to agree. 

The pork huaraches was the star and I highly recommend it. The ""weak sauce"" served on the side was right up my alley. I didn't love the fish taco, and the chicken taco was pretty good. However, the tortillas were really well made and delicious, and the variance of flavours between all items means I'd definitely be back to try some other things and get more huaraches."
La Chingada	5	2019-04-17	"Well, it lived up to the hype.

I mean, I went in part because the name was hilarious.

It was not too busy when we arrived, but they were swapping shifts, and our first server handed us over to one guy who was pretty solidly overworked for the moment, yet still managed to take pretty good care of us.

We had Choriqueso starter, and each had a taco and a huarache (think of it as being like an open-faced taco on a more robustly sized tortilla - the name literally is shared with a sandal), and a couple of drinks each. The cocktail list was full of interesting options, and their michelada was pretty good.

Overall, impressed. Will definitely come back.

There's a Green P lot just behind it."
La Chingada	5	2019-03-18	"Alright, I better review this place before I'm late to the party. If they keep up with the quality they provided when I visited, you can expect them to become renown in the area and even the city. When that happens, I'll proudly remind people that I first visited before their grand opening.

I had the tinga de pollo and barbacoa. I'm not sure it's necessary to break down the ingredients as many are familiar with Mexican food. They key is that the food quality and preparation are exceptional here. It's hard to avoid cliches such as ""texture"" ""fully seasoned"" ""done right"" ""full of flavour"" when describing the food here, but that's exactly how my experience was. They are clearly using great ingredients, even down to the tortillas which are better than most places. As they say ""good food makes good food"".

I would also add they everything was exceptionally fresh and the prices are fair. Can't wait to go back and hope that they can keep this up."
La Chingada	5	2019-03-29	Stopped by for a quick late night snack after a meal that left me hungry.  It was a Wednesday night and the place still had some tables free.  I went for the special of a chorizo taco and Sol beer for 10 dollars.  Not bad.  I added a grilled fish taco.  I have to say it is rare to get a grilled not fired piece of fish.  It was outstanding.  The chorizo was very good too.  I have to also comment on the shell.  It was one of the better corn tortillas I have ever had.  I will be back to try more.
La Chingada	3	2020-03-02	Went last week on Thursday to try their all you can eat Tacos. Nice hand made tortillas. I tried Beef, Carnitas, Pastor and Barbacoa. They were okish, the beef meat wasn't too good. Barbacoa was nice. Very well served with lots of meat. The salsas were in a bottle mild, medium and hot. Not very typical Mexican salsas in terms of flavour and freshness. A friend ordered a slice of Tres leches cake and something was off, the milk on it was not very good tbh so it wasn't eaten. So $19 for all you can eat, 3 tacos first and then one taco at the time. It wasn't completely bad but I doubt I will be back.
La Chingada	5	2019-05-19	"Gem of a find. 
My brother had this bookmarked since we landed in Toronto and we finally came here for lunch today. So pleased we did!
Ordered:
(Food)
Taste of Mexico platter - amazing value (good size) and the perfect way to try different things. We found the chorizo too salty for our taste, but everything else was fantastic. Pastor and grilled pineapple combination were excellent together, carne Asada was perfectly cooked. The guacamole was excellent too
Barbacoa taco - definitely a favorite we'll order again
Pastor taco - great but didn't realize we had pastor in the platter too, so an accidental repeat
Mexican street corn - can't go wrong with this
(Dessert)
Diablito - a must order!! Ended the meal on the perfect note with this dessert. Probably our favorite dish, beautifully put together
Churros - also great and freshly made

Overall, we had a wonderful meal for a reasonable price. Fantastic service, great food.
Only note - cleaning the hot sauce bottles before serving would be a good idea, as they look less than tempting. And we found the suicide sauce totally weak, but we eat a lot of spice in our house!"
La Chingada	4	2019-04-13	"Chicooooo! This place is a Mexican heaven within Toronto. Yes chico. The tacos are so spicy and saucy you will be crying to your mama.

Yes chica! If you want authentic Mexican food you came to the right place. No seriously chica the cheese dip I had made my mouth watery like a river. No joke. 

Yes chico. If you are into getting wasted on Mexican beer this place has got you covered too. Mmmm chico do you smell that? It's the smell of fresh chorizos! Get one or two for your chica, chico.

Yours Truly,
Chico & Chica"
La Chingada	3	2019-05-21	"I think this is between a 3 and a 4.  I enjoyed the tacos,   the chicken one was really very tasty.  But what a mess to eat,  the wrap was very soft and fell apart but it all had a wonderful taste,   lots of flavours.

I had the melted cheese starter with chorizo,  it was ok.  I personally don't like the corn wrap they make here.   They are thick and heavy and really doesn't add anything to the cheese dip.    We had the chips and dip to start with.   There was were some very nice dips here from chillies and guacamole too.   The chips are quite salty though, be warned.   We also had a tasty citrus drink,  grapefruit based,  this was very nice,  we both enjoyed this.   We ended with the churros which were very nice.  Sweet cinammon sugar on top,   very yummy. 

On the whole it was good and alright mixed together.   But also isn't cheap.   I think it cost us $70 for food and two sodas,"
La Chingada	4	2019-04-09	"This little gem of a restaurant has a tapas menu and also some curiously good cocktails.

I tried huaraches which literally means ""sandal"".

It's a misshapen tortilla with sausage, sauce and toppings. It was delicious, albeit a small portion. Also ordered a Chino Loco, sort of a Tom Collins.

An overall pretty good treat in the Little Portugal area. Hard to find places open before 5pm, so glad this one worked out!"
La Chingada	5	2019-10-13	"I live in Chicago and I'm spoiled with delicious Mexican food, so this place blew my mind. 

The sauces are amazing. If they sold them I would've brought a few bottles back with me. I had the taco bowl with chorizo and the choriqueso.  Both were beyond amazing. The chorizo is the best chorizo I ever had in my life."
La Chilaca Taqueria	5	2020-02-20	"Been here 2x in a week - really great value in getting four tasty Chorizo tacos for $10.

Lots of other options too but the 4 for $10 will fill you for the day."
La Chilaca Taqueria	5	2019-08-28	"Honestly one of the most delicious taco joint ever!! Huge size Al pastor steak burrito is just $9.05 including tax. Even tho it's not wrapped up with rice, but it's densely packed with black beans, cheese, meat, pepper, onions, and your choice of salsa. They have 5 different salsa with different spicy level, and I choose to mix the 2 most spicy one together. The staff were super nice, it's honestly a hidden gem in Kensington market, I loved it so much. 

Burrito - Al Pastor Steak - $8.00 ($9.05 including tax)"
La Chilaca Taqueria	5	2019-03-18	"Thanks to Yelp, I found this lovely spot! La Chilaca Taqueria is treasure deep in the heart of Kensington Market. 

We ordered up an Al Pastor taco and a chorizo taco. They come simply dressed, the way they should be. Some onions and cilantro with a hearty meat, and the Al Pastor came with a nice wedge of pineapple. There are mild, medium and spicy hot sauces on deck for your pleasure. 

There's a small seating area in the back or during a warmer day, these would be great taken outdoors. If in doubt, go here! I had a different taco spot on lock in Kensington and my opinions have since changed..."
La Chilaca Taqueria	5	2019-10-18	The Tacos Were Amazing! The line and sweating from the heat while eating these tacos were well worth it! I ordered the fish and chorizo tacos. The fish was my favorite, not breaded, big portions and perfectly spiced. The flavors were so put together very nicely. The chorizo taco was also sooo good. The spices had a kick but I loved it. Oh and they cooked everything in front of you! The place itself is small, not fancy but I honestly wasn't expecting it to be, it was housed in a building with about 4 other stands selling other options. They had a few seating options in the back and outside. The prices were affordable and the quality of the product was perfect. If you want authentic tacos, don't pass this place up! I can't wait to go back!
La Chilaca Taqueria	5	2019-09-19	"Holy yummmmm! This place is by far one of the best taco places in the city. I came here after finding out that Seven Live Tacos was closed for the night and I'm glad I did.

I had their pastor and chilaca tacos and it was very delicious. Seriously, this taco is made with so much love that it felt like I was eating the heart of Latin America. Love the way they make these tacos like they do in Mexico.

Not only is the food amazing but the cashier was singing along to the Mexican music. What more could you ask for in a taco place? 

Just an FYI, the seating is way in the back of the place. I didn't even know they had seating until I fishished eating. 

So my food snobs if you are looking for a taste of Mexico in the city, this is where you can find it! Make sure to try their extreme hot sauce so you can burn your mouth off"
La Chilaca Taqueria	5	2019-03-06	"Love all of the hidden gems in Kensington Market, and La Chilaca Taqueria is no exception - it's awesome.

Super tiny spot, located in the middle of the building, which houses other niche food stalls.

In terms of eating in, there are community folding tables and chairs at the back of the space, super rustic vibes but you don't come here for the Instagram photo opps if you know what I mean.

The service was friendly and quick, we were able to place our orders quickly.

Tacos were absolutely delicious - I can't recall the exact ones we tried but they were amazing. Super flavourful, tender, and just really tasty.

Make sure you ask for a side of their green salsa on the side, its sooooo good. We ended up taking the bit we had leftover and used them on fried eggs for breakfast the next morning - omg hot sauce heaven. 

If anyone from La Chilaca Taqueria reads this, please consider making batches of your hot sauce to sell, it's addictive!"
La Chilaca Taqueria	5	2019-04-23	"Let's taco bout this. Affordable tacos with well sized portions. What else can you ask for ?

La chilaca taqueria is small taco shop serving delicious morsels for a great price!  Selling 3-5$ tacos and certain specials (like 10$ for 4 pastor tacos). 

I ordered the carne, pastor, carnitas, pollo, and fish. I only wish I didn't get full so fast because I wanted more. Probably the closest thing I've tasted to tacos on the street in Mexico. 

Would highly recommend the fish ( very fresh and light) and the pastor (if you're a fan of pineapples) and if not go for the pork. They even have there own salsa station with grilled jalapeños to accompany your tacos for a complete bite. The shop is small and the interiors aren't of high class but who cares, cause the food is amazing. Number Juan in my books."
La Chilaca Taqueria	5	2018-07-31	"Chilaca, Campechano, shrimp, fish, chorizo, pastor I've tried it all and it's just simply great! Big bang for the buck. What all the tourists don't know is that this is where it's at, not sure why people are flocking to Seven Lives. 

The tacos are stuffed to brim so prepare for a bit of a messy experience but so worth it at $15 bucks for 3 tacos, which can easily feed 2 leaving you satisfied but not too stuffed. I love that they come with hot sauces with varying degrees of spice (beware of overloading) and if you're lucky at the right time, you may score extra roasted peppers/veggies, lime on the side counter to add in yourself or even a seat to sit at the back. They do open a back patio in the warmer months making it easier to get a spot. Don't expect it to be a place you would want to bring a large group to hang though, it's more in and out. 

Chilaca is their signature dish, a taco with stuffed cheesey pepper, your choice of meat, a crowd fav and a must try if it's your first time. Campechano a decent choice with a mix of meats and cheese. I definitely like the $5 tacos better with a mix of veggies and meat (fish is my fav). If you want an even cheaper way to fill yourself up, multiples of chorizo or pastor tacos are a bargain. Shrimp was probably the least favourite of them all given it was a bit blander than the rest in terms of flavour. 

This is located inside a shared shop along with other food counters all with Latin American flavours. Cheap way to split the rent and keep the prices low."
La Chilaca Taqueria	5	2020-04-21	Excellent food quality, service, portion, price and freshness.   Be forewarned it's not the nicest place to sit down and eat and the washroom shared by all the food stands inside is scary but what do you expect from Kensington Market.  I've been many times with a Mexican friend.
La Chilaca Taqueria	3	2018-11-24	"I came here to try out some tacos.  The tacos average in price about $5 each.  They have different sauces that you can put on your tacos.   I tried the pork tacos.  While it wasn't bad, it wasn't memorable either.  

This place is located inside and there are other businesses inside as well.  It was hot and stuffy.  The restaurant wasn't the cleanest either.  

Overall, it was just ok.  A bit cheaper than the more famous place across the street."
La Chilaca Taqueria	4	2018-03-25	"Absolutely amazing! Two overflowing tacos for $5. 
Made fresh right in front of you and worth the wait. 
I had one chorizo & one steak. The steak was a bit bland but the chorizo was ridiculously good. 
I'll be back for sure."
La Chilaca Taqueria	5	2017-11-20	"Continuing our downtown food tour we decided to try the La Chilaca Taqueria in the El Gordo complex in Kensington.

Didn't know at the time but the building houses several food stalls and this was the place where Seven Lives Tacos got there start before they exploded on the scene.

The tacos here were delicious!  For $5 you get a specialty taco and for $3 you get a basic taco but they are all fantastic!  Double wrapped, stuffed with protein of your choice and freshly made in house salsas to drown your tacos in.  There is some serious value here folks!

I'm not an authentic Mexican food expert but these tacos are probably more traditional ones then the Baja California ones at Seven Lives.  

Which one is better?   F*ck me man don't ask me that!! Its kinda like that movie ""Sophie's Choice"", which child do you choose?  I love them both but in different ways!!

Its a small set up as only 2 guys work with one doing all the cooking and one helping out.  They are really nice and deserve all the success given to them.  Will be back!

5/5!"
La Chilaca Taqueria	3	2018-08-06	"3.5 stars to some more great options of 4 stars.  Not going to lie... it's true Kensington in every sense of the neighbourhood.

If you're willing to look past the rough and gritty exterior, you may find some good tacos here.  Nothing risked is nothing gained and I feel that La Chilaca Taqueria fits that perfectly.  It's in the 'food court' of several Latin American food stalls.  Food court is an understatement... It's more like a disheveled, heavily worn and dirty open non A/C store that has every stall spilling out into a small room.  It shares the space with 3 other stalls.  

There are some tables in the back of the dingy place but there's a weird smell emanating from the back as you sit beside several broken old unused glassed counters.  On a crazy hot day, the lack of A/C makes this insane and feel like an oven.  The open back door to a few more seats barely helps.  The 'kitchen' is really a small stove top and a crammed setting of a kitchen sink and a counter to assemble.  

You're quickly greeted and told to look up at the menu.  There are daily deals like 2 chorizo tacos for $5 or 4 other tacos for $10.  Each taco is $5 each regardless of the type.  When we went, the carnitas werent ready but they had 8 other ones you could try.  Service here is efficient but I have to admit they were all busy with the World Cup... can't blame them since the entire Kensington (let's be real... Toronto) is watching.  I do have to worry a bit when we overheard the person in the kitchen saying how can they cook this chicken in under 3 minutes... ehhhh wut?  How about cooking it till it's done?

I have to admit the addition of their sauces really perked these up so grab some before taking a bite into them.  The creamy orange one has some good heat that could make you water up a bit if you're not careful.  I wasnt expecting that type of heat and wow, yeah... ice cream was needed to cool my tongue.  What I thought would be the spicy red transparent sauce was actually a tomato one that didn't have any heat and just added a little bit of flavour.  There was also a nice vibrant green sauce that was very good mix of mild jalalpeno, onions, and cilantro.  Totally refreshing to add.

Fish Taco - My favourite of the tacos.  The fish pan fried and still tender without being dried out.  This was a stuffed taco... the type where you take a bite and you realize that the sauce and pickled onions are just going to be exploding soon.  The sauce just oozes out onto your hand and you're soon licking your fingers.  The cilantro just gives a nice freshness to it... I know, not everyone likes cilantro but it's good on this one.  Another thing I love about this... they double wrap the taco so they dont fall apart easily AND they toast the corn tortilla up so they're a bit crispy.  Nice one. 4/5 

Vegetable Taco - Soooo I keep ordering Vegetable Tacos and I keep wondering why afterwards.  My search for a good one continues but I learned that tofu and cheese really doesn't work... at... all.  I feel like you do one or the other.  It's just a weird combination.  In addition to those, they had cilantro, pickled onion, and tomatoes. This one wasn't as flavourful so it really benefits from either the orange hot sauce (that will scorch you) or green fresh herb one.  3/5

Chorizo Taco - Another solid taco with the paprika giving the pork a nice flavour.  It was cooked fresh from the sausage and it didnt taste like it was standing in some pot for a few hours.  They garnished with pickled onions and cilantro and helped cut through the rich meat.  I was told this was authentic to the style in Mexico city.  4/5  

Beef Taco - Maybe I wasn't in the mood for cheese but the beef and cheese one didn't quite work.  As generous as they were with the cheese... I just felt this one was really quite heavy and a bit oily.  The beef was possibly a bit overcooked which made it a bit on the dry side.  I could have added more sauce to it but something didn't quite work as well as the chorizo.  3/5

Shrimp Taco - This was a solid one with small shrimps cooked fairly well.. they werent rubbery or dried out.  Just a nice juicy chew.  They added a spice to it that kept it out of the bland side ... though I have to admit, this wasn't as flavourful as the Chorizo.  This one does work well with a sauce to keep it from being boring.  They did garnish with the usual pickled onions and cilantro.  3.5/5

There are some really good tacos coming out of here and made freshly with some in house made sauces that really make the tacos pop.  BUT if you're the type where you're concerned about atmosphere, this might put you off.  Worse case, you can take it to go and eat it while you're walking about Kensington but just bring a few napkins, ok a lot... cause you're going to be leaving a trail of food dripping otherwise!"
La Chilaca Taqueria	5	2018-09-05	"La Chilaca is quintessential Kensington Market. It has an air of intrigue and imperfection that make it brilliant.

Are the back patio table cloths clean? Not even close.

Could you have lunch with Hilary Clinton back there and not be bothered? Probably.

Are the burritos massive and delicious? Yes.

Are they sometimes out of pork or shrimp? Yes. 

Can spiciness level be subjective here? Yes, but go for medium at least. 

Do you want to go into the washroom? Held out on all 6 previous visits, so not sure.

Does the food seem more authentic than the other chain restaurants that serve burritos and tacos?

A thousand times yes.

Is this a bit of a dive? Yes, and maybe deeper.

Are the staff here cool? If it comes without trying, it goes without saying."
La Chilaca Taqueria	4	2019-10-08	Absolutely the best chilacas anywhere.The people are so nice and the service is great. You can order online and have it ready for you to pick up. Great place just very busy and no where really to sit. Wish they had more locations.
La Chilaca Taqueria	4	2018-10-07	"Affordable tacos with well sized portions. What else can you ask for ?

La chilaca taqueria is small taco shop serving delicious morsels for a great price!  Selling 3-5$ tacos and certain specials (like 10$ for 4 pastor tacos). 

I ordered the carne, pastor, carnitas, pollo, and fish. I only wish I didn't get full so fast because I wanted more. Probably the closest thing I've tasted to tacos on the street in Mexico. 

Would highly recommend the fish ( very fresh and light) and the pastor (if you're a fan of pineapples) and if not go for the pork."
La Chilaca Taqueria	4	2019-05-01	"One of my favourite spot in the city for tacos! Hidden inside Kensington market, Chilaca is nearly always bustling. My go-to are the chorizo tacos($3 a piece or 4 for $10), which come with diced onions and cilantro, but the pastor tacos, which come with diced onions, cilantro and pineapple are fabulous as well.  

They have house made hot sauces available and these should not be overlooked. The green ""mild"" sauce is fresh and light, and adds the perfect extra bit of freshness. The orange hot sauce is not to be taken lightly. I like my food pretty spicy but I add only the smallest few drops of this to each taco because I absolutely love the flavour but damn does it have a kick! My only complaint is with their medium sauce. Over the last six months or so they have changed the recipe for their medium hot sauce. I find the new sauce far too tomatoey, and with hardly any heat at all. Their previous sauce was less tomato based and had the perfect balance of heat and flavour. Would love a switch back!! 

On Saturdays they sometimes make a mango salsa in addition to their hot sauces which is amazing with the pastor tacos. This is originally what got me hooked on Chilaca! (Besides the great price & friendly staff). 

If you head to the back of the little food prep area you'll find a small patio in the summer that's usually pretty quiet so you can enjoy your meal away from the business that is Kensington Market in the warm weather. 

I would (and do) recommend this spot to everyone I know who mentions they like tacos. If you are spending a day in Toronto near Kensington and can only try tacos from one joint, let it be this one."
La Chilaca Taqueria	5	2019-08-03	"TOP 3 TACO PLACE IN TORONTO!!!!

Came here for lunch on a Saturday and it's sooooo good. I don't know how long it's been there but I have been missing out. 

**to the people that complain about the interior/look of the place think about what you are actually reviewing....this is a hidden gem, you are not going here for fine dining. Great food and great service. Take your tacos one block to the park and enjoy them outside. 

PRO'S 
-$5-$6 per taco for a good portion 
-shrimp taco (cheese, shrimp, peppers) 10/10 and one of the best I have ever had 
-beef (so much flavour) 

CONS. 

-nothing! Didn't you just see what I wrote above? 

Come here and ditch 7 lives. Kensington has a new #1 area .


I had 5 tacos total/ 3 drinks and spent $30 total 

I will be back and can't wait for that shrimp taco ...until we meet again ....days go by and still I think of you."
La Chilaca Taqueria	5	2018-05-10	"Located at the back of the El Gordo complex in Kensington Market is a little hole in the wall you will not want to miss. La Chilaca Taqueria serves up authentic delicious Mexican cuisine at a price point that will knock your socks off!

I ended up trying their daily special (two Pastor Tacos for $5.00) and was thoroughly impressed. First of all, these things are huge (similar to the ones at Seven Lives). They have a crisp, grilled double layered corn tortilla which was absolutely delicious - soft, pliable and surprisingly light with just a hint of sweetness and a slight charred flavour. What really amazed me was that the tortilla held together even with all the filling inside it!

The inside of the tortilla is stuffed with a generous amount of delicious, tender marinated pork which was then topped with fresh onions, pineapple and cilantro. I loved how the sweet juicy pineapples added a vibrant summertime feel to the well-seasoned meat and the cilantro complimented everything with a light citrusy and peppery overtone. I squeezed on a splash of lime for a bit more of a sweet citrus kick. And then added on some of the red spicy sauce to enhance the flavours (although in retrospect, I should have probably gone with the green mild sauce instead). Definitely a taco you won't want to miss!"
La Chilaca Taqueria	4	2017-06-30	"Other Yelp reviews - and mostly their drool-worthy photos - made me want to try this place. My biggest pet peeve about tacos I've tried in this town is that the tortillas are dry, cold and crumbly. From the photos, there was real hope that this place did their tortillas up right. I ordered the special - these two enormous Al Pastor tacos for $5. They hit the spot and I appreciated the attention paid to everything - the tortillas definitely saw some grease from the grill, the meat was hot, cilantro, onions, pineapple was fresh and nicely cut, and they were more than generous with the ingredients.

It's easy to miss this place as it's a little counter at the back of a place in Kensington Market that houses a few other food stalls (the churros ice cream cone counter faces the street - walk past and head to the back, right side). Several orders went in around the same time as ours, so it was a bit unclear whether we should wait near the grill (this is where the molcajete bowls are with the salsas) or sit down and wait at the tables at the back, or whether we should pay when we ordered or wait until after... just go with the flow and I promise it will all work out!!

We sat down and one of the grill guys brought our order over, along with 3 little plastic cups of each of the sauces. I didn't see a shawarma-style spit here, so not sure how they prepare their meat before giving it a go on the grill. I thought these tacos might stand out a touch more if the marinade was more distinctive or if the cut was a little juicier/fattier.

As it stands, I'd definitely come back to have these again and try some other kinds. The young staff all seemed super friendly and eager to make a go of this place. It deserves your support!!!"
Itacate	5	2019-12-14	This place is fantastic! I felt like I was in Mexico. The energy, the hospitality, the FOOD teleported me there after one bite. Considering this is in Toronto I was surprised how inexpensive it was. If you haven't been here yet...GO! Try the Gringa it was do delicious!
Itacate	2	2019-10-19	"This is a tough one! As some of you may know I love Tacos! I kept hearing that Itacate was the best place to grab the most authentic tacos in Toronto and obviously I had to give it a try. This little spot is located on St.Claire W and it doubles as a Butcher shop. I walk in and it smells amazing! I love pork tacos and since I can cook all other tacos I decided to get the Carnitas and El pastor. I was so excited and 2 of the saddest looking tacos were brought over. 

Now, looks are not everything so I decided to take a bite. Even though the tacos were super plain I figured if the meat is super flavourful I won't need any sauces. The meats were very chewy, at one point I felt like I was eating leather. Most of the Pork had gooey fat all over it and I just wasn't a fan. I added cilantro, onions and the extra spicy sauce which helped with flavour but the meat was a big issue for me. 

Keep Eating,
Angela"
Itacate	1	2019-07-08	"I don't usually UPDATE a review; Friday was a disaster.
The owners should provide the staff/customers AIR CONDITIONING, they are sweating into the grill it's so hot (flavour to the tacos?).
The time it took to get 2 tacos was LONG.  Poor interior design, cluttered.  1 of 2 tacos went into the trash (very under cooked).  The tables are cluttered in garbage, food scraps.  They make enough money, pay a teenager to clean.  This place needs HELP.
It was one of those experiences where I'll try other spots on St Clair, over Itacate."
Itacate	4	2019-08-17	"If you are looking for authentic tacos, Itacate is definitely the place to go. This is a small taco shop located at the front of a butcher shop in the St Clair West area. It is quite small with about two or three tables and gets very busy. 

I had the opportunity to try their fish, chicken, beef and steak tacos and all were really good, however, the steak, WOW! that steak taco was by far the best taco I have ever had. Next time I think i will get all steak. It had the perfect amount of fat and the meat was super tender. 

I also really enjoyed the two types of salsa they had, one was red and one was green. Both were super fresh and not overly spicy. 

I am not much of a taco fan but maybe that is because prior to this I have never had an authentic taco. Itacate has changed my mind and I will definitely be back!"
Itacate	3	2020-03-07	"Came for lunch around 12:30. The place only has two tables and some standing room. After you order and pay, they give you a number and  you seat yourself. 

The tacos all tasted good but were quite overpriced at 6 bucks each. The enchilada tasted good and was better priced at 8 bucks. 

I didn't feel the service was great, the cooks seemed annoyed when orders started piling up or when a customer asked for the provided cilantro/onions/ salsa to be refilled. Space wise the place sucks with only two tables. They also said there was not bathroom for customers ( even though if we paid). Floors and tables were not clean either. 

I also asked their facebook page a few days before my saturday visit if they have tamales. It's on the menu and some reviews on other review sites mentioned they are not usually available. I got a reply within 1 hour that they would have tamales around noon. When I asked about them, i was told they make them some weeks and not others. I do not think they are worth returning to. There are other taquerias in the city that have cleaner restaurants and friendlier staff. Take out might be ok."
Itacate	5	2019-05-06	"Itacate is a taqueria located inside a butcher shop on St. Clair West. I was here for lunch yesterday and I've been thinking about it all day. 

We got the guacamole with chips, steak taco, chorizo taco, and gringas.

The guacamole was made on the spot. It was super fresh, chunky, and delicious. It just needed a tiny bit more salt to be perfect.

The meat was all impeccable: very savoury and perfectly cooked. The tacos came with corn tortillas. They were dressed simply, with just a little onion and cilantro. There are also a variety of pepper salsas available that have a good kick.

My favourite was the gringas, which are flour tortillas folded over, melted cheese, al pastor, and pineapple. They were incredible. I've never had better al pastor. The effect was not unlike Hawaiian pizza, in the best possible way. The portion was massive; so big we took half of it home and reheated it in a pan for dinner, along with the leftover guacamole. 

Just a great spot, and I plan to return soon."
Itacate	5	2018-08-24	"After the first bite of the carnitas taco I ordered, I wanted to put it down and apologize to the chef for all the times I made carnitas at home. What the hell was I thinking? How could I dare to think I had the right to make carnitas when this miracle existed?

I've been back a few more times and ordered more items on the menu. Everything I've had is great. Everything is made fresh right in front of you and the ingredients are all at peak yumminess, down to the chopped white onions at the toppings station. 

Hot tip: come here after 10:30pm on Fridays and Saturdays for their special late night menu. They serve up a few different varieties of tortas (basically subs) that feature a generous helping of meat, cheese (if you're into that sort of thing), and guacamole at no extra charge (I'm looking at you, Chipotle). They have a hot dog and egg torta that has absolutely no business being as good as it is. I watched the chef whisk the eggs, chop up the hot dog and cook it all up on the flat top. The eggs were fluffy as hell and the flavours mixed together into a masterpiece that Imran N. and I couldn't believe. 

So yeah. Go here, be polite and get the best damn Mexican food in the city."
Itacate	5	2019-01-27	"My, my! Can't write a review here without thinking about their meaty tacos... Makes me hungry all the time. Good price, lots of great options and hearty toppings! Yes, it's a small place and they take cash only, but don't let that stop you from trying this place out. Been here a few times now, I've tried their chorizo & papas, pastor, lengua, and carnitas. Very generous with the meat and you can put your condiments yourself (unlike some other taco places). 

One of the most authentic Mexican taco places I've been in Toronto. Give it a try and you won't regret it"
Itacate	5	2019-10-10	One of my fav Mexican tacos. They've got a variety of tacos to choose from. They've also got other options. Be sure to bring cash.
Itacate	4	2019-05-05	"I'm a huge fan of Authentic tacos, and in many ways consider Tacos El Asadore the measure of quality tacos for Toronto. Don't anyone suggest Wilber's, except those hipster never been to Mexico wannabes. 

Anyway. This soot is true to Yelp tips, small setup inside a butcher shop. Likely more Mexican stream joint than butcher shop, given the sq footage, I'll bet they expand and take the whole place over soon. 

I went pretty safe, grabbed a couple steak tacos at $6 a piece. The corn tortilla was authentic and really good, while the meat was mildly seasoned and unfortunately a bit too full of gristle for my liking. Yes, glad I had a napkin. 

One thing I liked are the accessible condiments as wanted. Onions, cilantro, hot sauce and mild. All fresh, all good. Once you add everything and bite, you'll feel like you're warped to a small taqueria in Mexico. Well done. 

I'll be back, and ready to explore the wider offerings they have."
Itacate	4	2017-11-09	"Itacate is a small family run taqueria located in the west end of Toronto. It's situated inside a butcher shop on the Northwest corner of St.Clair Ave West and Oakwood Ave right across Oakwood Collegiate Institute. It's a place I have been meaning to try since it's usually on the list of hidden gem hotspots in Toronto and has gotten rave reviews for serving authentic Mexican tacos.

I ordered two tacos ($5 each tax included), a steak, cheese and onion taco and something adventurous which was a cow tongue taco. Both tacos came on a double layered soft tortilla. The tacos don't come with any dressing and you have the option of dressing the tacos with chopped onions, cilantro, hot sauce, guac and lime for drizzling.

The tacos were authentic and delicious, brought back memories of getting tacos from food stalls when I visited Mexico. Nice fresh soft tortillas, the steak, cheese and onion taco was delicious. I had never tried cow tongue before so i was expecting something chewy, the cow tongue was really soft and tender surprisingly, but could have used a little bit more seasoning.

Overall, if you are looking for a simple no frills place to have good authentic tacos, you should definitely check out Itacate. The tacos aren't cheap at $5 each tax included but the prices aren't crazy either, let's be honest, eating out in Toronto isn't cheap anymore. It's definitely a hole in the wall gem for authentic Mexican tacos."
Itacate	5	2019-02-22	My only thought eating Itacate was this is real to the bone. In the back of a butcher shop, the food looked and smelled incredible. There is a huge rotating shanks of meat right above the grill. The menu has no photos and is in straight Spanish so my mum has trouble, but we got a variety of tacos and one super taco(two tortillas fused together with 2 meats). It's not a great place if you're in a rush, but it was very worth the rush. She got steak tacos with grilled cheese put on the oiled tortilla, and the steak melted your mouth. My double taco was probably the best taco I've ever had. The grilled cheese underneath, it had a mix of chorizo and grilled steak. Unbelievable experience, as soon as I have access to car I'm pulling up again. 11/10
Itacate	3	2018-10-18	"Were the tacos good? Definitely. Pescado, beef and pork with pineapple, all solid choices with two homemade tortillas each. 

The people were pleasant, though not overly friendly. 

Its cash only, that in my book makes things difficult. 

The wait is long, I had to wait (I was told) 25-30 mins for three tacos. To me they just need to sort out their process to get through orders faster. I understand you have one big order before me and you want to be authentic, but there must be efficiencies.

Maybe if you offered like chips while I wait it would smooth things out for me.

It's delicious and authentic like I said, but not sure I'd wait another 30 mins for tacos."
Itacate	4	2018-08-28	"I ordered suadero (beef) tacos. I didn't have high expectations because I've eaten real tacos in Mexico City and it's hard to match that authentic taste.
These tacos were loaded with beef. Very filling. I was worried that I'd still be hungry, but they use the large tortillas and they were loaded. 
I'm happy to say that they were quite delicious. Even my wife who is Mexican really enjoyed the food here. And she's hard to please when it comes to Mexican food. 
I had one of my wife's al pastor tacos and it was soooo flavourful. I highly recommend this one as well. 
The hot sauce was nice and hot too if you like your food spicy. 
My only knock, was that the service was a bit slow. Other then that, this place is the real deal."
Itacate	4	2018-09-06	"If you've got a late night craving (i.e your very drunk), this is the spot. 

The late night torta menu is effectively crack."
Itacate	5	2018-11-20	"No one eats more than I do. Seriously. I'm a fat fat man in a little man's body.
I've eaten all over this city and only now started to write reviews, because my wife's sister got invited to be a yelp elite and she can't even boil water and only eats where I tell her to, so I'll start with my favs:

Best AUTHENTIC taco in the city though I still prefer Wilbur overall.

This is the most ghetto place ever but it's really awesome and you feel like you're eating in the streets of Tijuana without the risk of being beheaded by MS-13 or having to jump back over the wall.

If you speak English, you will be the only one here."
Itacate	5	2018-06-19	"Amazing tacos. Totally authentic. The menu is in Spanish but the staff speak English. Watch for the salsas - they are hot! 
Another tip: if you want tacos, you need to be there during the first shift (before 9pm, I believe). Otherwise, they only make tortas. They're okay, but not as good as the tacos.
The butcher shop part of the store in the back seems a bit odd -- hardly any stuff in the refrigerator -- but adds to the unique ambience of the place."
Itacate	5	2019-01-05	"Itacate probably serves the best tacos I have ever had in Toronto. From the tortillas - an extremely important, and underrated (in Toronto) part of of the taco, to the salsas, Itacate tacos are exceptional. Particularly the Al Pastor - by far the best I have had in the city (you get a spit and a pineapple! The real deal!)

Certainly come here for the food, and skip the more trendy spots in the city. Itacate is authentic, and delicious."
Itacate	5	2019-07-24	We don't have very many examples of good Mexican food back home in Hawaii. I knew there had to be some good examples here in Toronto. I was not disappointed. My son and I practically swallowed the steak tacos whole and I quickly rushed to order more. I never had a pombazo before that was also delicious. Fresh ingredients and cooked with care. I will be back before we leave town
Itacate	5	2018-12-01	"Bring cash. Have patience. Be hungry. Eat everything you can. 

You'll be hard pressed to find another place like this in Toronto. This is the best. The dishes here are an experience. You'll leave here, walk a block, and then want to return for more. 

To all the reviewers docking stars for this place being cash-only....really?!?"
Mexico Lindo	5	2020-05-31	ALERT: This restaurant's website is incorrect on the Yelp site--it will take you to a similarly named restaurant in another city. Please do try this restaurant, it is a small, cozy family restaurant run by Mexicans. The food is wonderful and the atmosphere authentic. Our all time favourite is Burrito del Mar, and we order it every time. The food is tasty and quite filling--and the beer is cold and authentic as well. We have been going to this restaurant for at least twenty years now and it has always been the same in quality and atmosphere. You can't get better than that.
Mexico Lindo	5	2019-08-10	"Came here for pre-dinner drinks with a friend and I must say it's a COMPLETE GEM. I don't know why more people don't come to eat here, it's awesome. I pass by on my way to work every day but I never noticed it. 
We sat out on the patio and it was an extremely nice day. It let us talk and catch up since we haven't in a while. Our table was a little weird, every time I leaned on it it would roll because of the wheels on the bottom.
The service was amazing, but it was also not super busy at 5PM on a Friday - it started picking up around 7PM after we left. The server was very attentive to our needs, periodically checking in but not *too* often. 
The food/drink was unbelievable! I had a strawberry daiquiri and my friend had a piña colada. They use real coconuts and real strawberries (albeit they were frozen) and they tasted AMAZING, better than the ones I had in Mexico. We had some chips with guacamole and it was sooooooo fresh. They make their chips in house and you can really tell. Very comparable to one restaurant I went to in Mexico called Coco Cabana outside our resort in Cancun."
Mexico Lindo	2	2017-10-25	"The decor is nice and the atmosphere feels right, but this place lacked a bit of service attention. 

We dropped by for a quick bite as we love Mexican food. We ended up ordering the fajitas for two. It was a large portion of meat (we got chicken and chorizo mix) but there were only 5 (five) tiny tortillas... that didn't make sense to me. 2 or us, lots of meat, but very few tortillas...we asked and we had to pay to get more, which I thought was not reasonable. I didn't get more cause I'm cheap. Also, we got a tiny container of sour cream. 

Overall it felt like they offered very little in terms of condiments. 
I waited a good 5-10 minutes to get more napkins and some hot sauce (Something good and spicy) but no luck. I ended up getting up and walking to the front to ask for it. Overall the service wasn't great. 
The fajitas were good but nothing out of this world. The selection of Mexican beers was also limited. 
We will have to keep looking for the ultimate Mexican Food place!"
Mexico Lindo	3	2018-07-20	"I'm all for small, authentic , family run business , and this is exactly what you get at Mexico Lindo. 
My friend and I visited on a Wednesday afternoon & we were one of two tables. I ordered the guacamole, & fish tacos (on special on Wednesday's) & my friend ordered the beef chimichanga. 
The guacamole was amazing- lasted us 3-4 refills of chips. It was fresh, smooth & the perfect consistency. I just wish it came with better salsa (tasted like the basic Tostitos one out of the jar). 
The fish tacos- were okay at most. Not much flavour in the tacos (I've had better at JOEYS & other chain restos). Their rice however was fresh & delicious and their salad tasted like a Greek salad but was still very good. Also- there was nothing spicy or flavourful about the dish which is why I was  disappointed. 
The chimichangas- my friend ordered beef but got chicken. Not the biggest deal to us but still odd how the waitress forgot when we were one of two tables. She liked her dish and it was so filling! 

Overall, my friend and I both left with take out boxes because of how filling everything was. Majority - if not all- plates come with beans, rice & salad. Service and food were mediocre at best (the birchmount express location is much better) but I will come back here to support the family's business."
Mexico Lindo	5	2019-07-12	Excellent restaurant! Speedy service. Food arrived hot and fresh. Price was reasonable. Highly recommend, either for a solo meal or with friends.
Mexico Lindo	3	2017-06-18	"We came here for Father's Day dinner on a slow Sunday. On google, it said the restaurant was closed on Sunday but apparently not ( they are open until 9pm), however when we called for a reservation they said they don't take reservation on Friday, Saturday and Sunday and that they were open till 8 pm. 

Restaurant was almost empty and after eating the food here we understand why. Service was okay, food was so-so! Nothing extraordinary that I can talk about nor I would return for."
Mexico Lindo	5	2017-02-09	"The best mexican restaurant I have been to (this is my first authentic mexican restaurant beside's chipotle, taco del mar and fat bastard burrito co.)

I had the camrones in the spicy sauce. Shrimp  were very succulent and sauce tasted yummy, anyone who likes shrimp should try this. I went with the smaller portion and after tasting, I really regret not going for the bigger portion. 

And my girlfriend had the enchiladas suizas. The crepes were stuffed with veggies and cheese topped with sour cream, cheese and enchilada souce. And they had a side of salad, rice and beans, its just worth every penny.

This is my new favourite place..!!!"
Mexico Lindo	5	2013-12-02	"I am always looking for a good authentic Mexican restaurant and this place is now on the top of my charts! 

I went here on a Saturday night and the place was full! I also took the Mexicans eating at this place and the previous reviews on Yelp as a good sign.

The owner is super friendly and being in this restaurant made me feel like I was home, in my second life, Acapulco.

The strawberry daiquiri was delicious! The portions are very generous and the chicken chimichanga hit the spot! But make sure you leave room for dessert.

I love deep fried ice cream, and alot of times the outside just isn't nice but the deep fried ice cream here was so perfect! Just thinking about the food here is making my mouth water!

I am not even a fan of refried beans but the ones here are sooooo delicious! 

I can't wait to come back, maybe I will go there tonight! What are you waiting for, I will meet you there!"
Mexico Lindo	4	2016-04-11	"Been there a few times. Never disappointed in anyway. Only once...they ran out of Guacamole, but that was 8:15pm.
I always go with their combo. A beef burrito and a chicken enchilada served with rice, beans and salad. - $15.95. Sangria - $6.95. And finish off with the Deep Fried Ice Cream - $8.
And recently I found out they have an Express located in Scarborough. Will try that later on."
Mexico Lindo	3	2016-10-29	"I would rate this place a 3.5.  The decor was greatly outdated.  The food was tasty Mexican food, nothing wrong with anything my table got.  Just be weary, if you're not into spice make sure you know what you're ordering with the waiter.  The pictures everyone has posted is exactly what we got.

In terms of the service, it was a one man show.  I get what other reviews mean about the service.  This older gentleman (maybe owner?) took the orders, showed people to their seats, bused the tables, refilled water, etc.  He did everything 2-3 waiters would do.  No surprise that getting his attention would be difficult.  We had no issues with the service.  

FYI, if your mouth is on fire from the chorizo or other spicy sauces, Hollywood Gelato is only a few buildings north."
Mexico Lindo	3	2015-02-11	Came here tonight for dinner tonight because of awesome experience last time.  It was pretty empty on a Wednesday evening.  The owners are really lovely and this is why I give it 3 stars.  The food is not what it was when I visited last. I really enjoy authentic Mexican food and unfortunately the food tonight lacked spice that I really enjoy.   The food was flavourful but not nearly as amazing as I remember.  I ordered my food spicy and they wasn't even the slightest tingle :(
Mexico Lindo	1	2016-06-11	"Tried to go here for our anniversary. No one acknowledged us at the door for quite a while. When the gentleman finally asked for how many and we answered three, he told us 5 min. There were several open tables, not sure why we had to wait, especially since I'm visibly disabled. 

There was one table for two available at the front, and we watched him futz with it and add a third placemat to an already crowded table. When he motioned us over (he didn't come get us, just beckoned) I had to try to explain to him that this table was not suitable as my leg wouldn't fit. He said it was for three. I asked if we could have a four top. He said none were available. I tried again to explain that I'm handicapped and wouldn't fit at this tiny table. 

Let me be clear, there were other available tables, but they were 6 tops, and he didn't want to lose the seats. I offered to wait for a four top but he said he couldn't tell me how long that would be. 

So we left. So much for hospitality. He was rude and dismissive and I won't waste the drive again. We went next door to the seafood restaurant. It was fabulous."
Mexico Lindo	4	2014-06-18	"I love the food at Mexico Lindo, and although I don't live in the area I try to visit every now and again. The owner, Sandra, and her family do a great job and serve authentic Mexican food and drinks.

I always order the chicken fajitas but everything I see coming out of the kitchen looks (and smells) great. The service can be a little 'relaxed' to say the least. Free chips and guacamole while you wait for your meal.

The only thing I would change is the prices, which at around $30 per person with no drinks, is a little on the expensive side. Having said that, this is true for a lot of Mexican restaurants in the city. Overall a solid four stars."
Mexico Lindo	5	2014-05-04	"Delicious. The number one takeaway from this restaurant was ""fresh"". Freshly made guacamole (served right in the mortar and pestle it was prepared in), freshly made tortilla chips, fresh rice, refried beans, and tender chicken and well-seasoned beef. 

I had their ""Tobasco"" combo - a beef burrito in red sauce, and a chicken enchilada in tomatillo sauce. The latter sauce was flavourful and delicious.

We were served by Alexa, who recommended us several items and was a great host. Their diablo hot sauce was also excellent. 

Definitely our new weeknight Mexican spot."
Mexico Lindo	3	2017-11-06	The food was just ok but, I'm sure they can do much better. I think is a bit overpriced for what you get, mexican food is not supposed to be fancy and overpriced
Mexico Lindo	1	2017-10-05	"Worst service ever, was yelled at by the head cook when we asked if take out was available because he was too busy and its not worth his time for a small order. His words.  Avoid this place, much better options ""Mariachi"" on Yonge street 2 mins away.  Playa Cabana downtown."
Mexico Lindo	3	2017-06-02	I was really excited for this place because it had been such a long time since I've had Mexican food. While everything tasted great I was slightly disappointed by the mediocre serving sizes. And warning that the complimentary salsa is very spicy! Also, not that it's the restaurant's fault, but there's a huge sidewalk planter right in front of the entrance which made it pretty much impossible for our stroller to go through. A wheelchair would definitely not be able to pass so heads up. Otherwise seems like a casual and family-friendly place.
Mexico Lindo	5	2017-04-21	"Came here on a weeknight and was really pleasantly surprised with the whole experience.

The food was really great, and the price made it even better. I got enchiladas; they were really tasty, not super greasy, and the portion size was big. 

Our server was friendly and pretty attentive considering she was alone during the dinner rush.

If you're looking for some sleek modern decor, go somewhere else because this place has more of a family restaurant/low key vibe. 

All in all, a great place to go for generous portion sizes, good prices, and a chill atmosphere."
Mexico Lindo	5	2016-09-03	Extremely happy with this place! It was first time for me at Mexican restaurant, and I definitely come back! Food was very tasty! Their Corona taste better than anywhere else! Wonderful place, amazing service! Recommend his restaurant to my friends!
Mexico Lindo	4	2017-06-11	Went for an early Sunday dinner. We got the nachos fiesta to start, I got the deep fried tortilla with her chorizo and she got the beef. quesadilla. Everything was delicious. Service was quick and courteous. Would recommend
Xola Mexican Food	5	2020-03-13	"Wonderful restaurant with great service! They give traditional Mexican food an upscale presentation to all their dishes! And find food that you don't usually find in an average Mexican taco place. 
Ps. That cucumber-spicy fresh water is mouth watering!"
Xola Mexican Food	1	2020-01-29	"I came her few weeks ago. I straight up saw this lady (pretty sure the owner) handle cash/ scratch her head and touched the food right after. I

Of course I only had a few bites and left the rest cause I was so grossed out. When I was paying for my bill, I let her know what I saw and she started giving racist quotes. ""All the chinese places do the same thing"", and walked away.

I would have just left it and not think twice, but for them to say something like that, that is a big nono. 

McDonalds food is higher quality than this. 

DO NOT COME HERE."
Xola Mexican Food	3	2018-09-28	"It is pretty hard to find good Mexican food in Toronto ( at least veggie) and I'm not talking about the good ole beans and cheese on tortilla! Anyway, this restaurant is NOT in that ""off the hook"" food category. 

Dinner with hubby and child on a Friday evening was alright. This place is pretty small and can accommodate 18-20 people total in the restaurant, sitting is pretty tight. 
Service- mediocre, we had to ask for stuff every time as no one really ""checked in"" on us, excepted once towards the end. 
Price- comparable to other restaurants in the neighbourhood. 
Food- ""average"", nothing different than other Mexican restaurants around. 
Rating- 2.5-3/5"
Xola Mexican Food	5	2019-09-24	If you're in the mood for authentic Mexican this is the place.  Best Margaritas, my favourite guacamole is blue cheese with walnuts: cactus one is also pretty divine.  Amazing mexican music & totally worth every penny.
Xola Mexican Food	5	2019-01-06	"Very cozy restaurant with extremely friendly service.  The food is delicious and all made from scratch cooking.  

Guacamole with goat cheese was unique and perfect for an appetizer.

The lamb was fantastic.  Very tasty, very filling. Come hungry.  

I love taquitos and these were delicious and plentiful.  You get five.  Loved the tomatillos salsa too. 

Was there tonight for the first time and will be sure to come back and try some different dishes."
Xola Mexican Food	5	2018-05-27	"Absolutely the best Mexican restaurant in Toronto... The other comments stating the same fact are true. The chef and family cook with heart and the result is pure authentic Mexican food that is definitely top class. We tried the steak taco and duck confit... Our taste buds were having a feista on their own. 

Highly recommend this restaurant and will come back for repeat visits."
Xola Mexican Food	4	2017-12-30	"Xola is definitely one of the better authentic Mexican restaurants around the beaches area (if not the only)

This is the second time we came here. It's a small mom & pop restaurant and has great service and food. 

Ok so first off, this place is not your cheapest Mexican place, but you get what you pay for. But once you stack up the prices against other Mexican places like la carnita and Wilbur, it's actually pretty reasonable. 

Came here twice, once with just 2 people, and another time with 4.

First time we just ordered bunch of apps, wings are awesome and the Baja taco was ok. 

The better experience was when we came with 4 pple. We ordered 3 apps (wings, app trio, and guac) to share and each person ordered a main for themselves. 

The apps were delicious. Guac was $11 and is around that price no matter where u go.. 

App trio was okay I would say..would have liked 1 more tacquitto in there. 

The mains were great. The 4 of us all ordered different things, they brought them out alongside with a container of fresh tortillas. They were even kind enough to bring out more tortillas when we were finished. We were stuffed when done. Bill including tax and tip came to about $35 a person. Pretty good if you ask me.

Overall service was great. 

Would definitely come back especially when you get the Mexican craving and don't want to travel too far!"
Xola Mexican Food	5	2019-09-14	The food was excellent - everything we ordered was very flavourful - the Mango margarita was delicious.  Service and ambiance were excellent as well.  I will be returning again for sure!
Xola Mexican Food	5	2017-12-18	"Best Mex on the beach. Some of the best food I ever ate period
I want to eat here every night. Excellent food."
Xola Mexican Food	5	2019-01-12	Fantastic flavour. Ordered to take-out. Fresh and great quantity. A new favourite for sure.
Xola Mexican Food	4	2017-03-19	"Nice and cozy with friendly service.  Dinner was good but not wow.  We had Barbacoa de Borrego and Chocinita Pibli, both were good but you only get tortillas, a very small cup of beans and pineapple salsa.  No rice.  Both dinners were appetizer sized and priced $18-$20 each. For starters we had guacamole sampler which was excellent but definitely overpriced @ $18.  

I would recommend this place but beware of portion size for the price you pay."
Xola Mexican Food	5	2018-10-16	One of the best Mexican restaurants in Toronto. Small little place and is almost always packed. Everything on the menu is delicious, good portions, but a tad overpriced. What can you expect - leases for restaurants in the Beaches are astronomical. Wife has a shellfish allergy and they were honest to say she wasn't safe to eat there due to the small kitchen and chance on cross-contamination. Fantastic choice of rare tequilas. Cant go wrong with Xola!
Xola Mexican Food	5	2018-10-03	First time here and I loved everything we ordered. The food was authentic and very flavourful. Each dish had its own unique flavours. It's a great Mexican spot in the beaches.
Xola Mexican Food	4	2014-05-17	"Good Eats can be that simple and I love how Xola Mexican Food prepares their food. Fresh ingredients and with a touch of love, herbs and spices, Mexican Food is just that simple.

The interior is small and cozy. We were here for a late brunch on a Sunday and there was no wait at all. Service can be a little slow as Xola is more like a family run and with only 1 chef and 1 server working here during our visit.

We shared: 

Horchata ($3.50)
- I never really into Horchata and I found their version not as nutty and creamy as I preferred
- maybe adding rum to become Ronchata next time!

Burrito Lamb ($8.95)
- slow cooked pulled lamb was so soft and moist with a lot of flavour

Fish Taco ($15)
- fish has a nice and firm texture and the breading was so light and crispy!
- love the spicy mayo, guacamoles, pickled cabbage and everything just go so well together!

Good Mexican food is hard to find in Toronto and of course I would be coming back to Xola for more!"
Xola Mexican Food	4	2017-08-02	Came here upon invitation of my friend for his birthday dinner.  Because the restaurant was tiny, we shut the place down for the night with 20-something people in our party.  Happy to be there as the service was very good, the servers keeping up with the big crowd and I was in good company for the whole meal.  I haven't even started with how the food tasted good and this comes from someone who is not such a big fan of tacos.  I definitely enjoyed the warm nachos, tasty and fresh guacamole samplers and absolutely yummy stuffed poblano pepper tacos.  Definitely a good find!
Xola Mexican Food	2	2017-02-24	"Xola Mexican Food would be a great cosy place to take a first date. They promise Mexican food unlike any other. The small setting is endearing. While the service was excellent, and the menu promised good, fresh ingredients...

No salsa or chips to get you started on the house as is usual in the places I've been. Instead, for $10.50 or so, when we ordered the Guacamole as an appetizer, it was excellent and enough for both of us. As good as avocados can be. Not special.

I ordered the Duck. I received a very small serving roast duck taken off the bone in a small bowl, several small wraps, a  1/2 ramekin of chopped fruit for the wrap, a  1/2 ramekin of sour cream. That's it. No potatoes. No rice. No salad. Messy.  It was OK. Not interesting. Cost over $22.00.

My girlfriend ordered braised Lamb. Same thing. It was a tiny portion, stewed and served in a small bowl, with several small wraps,  1/2 ramekin of black beans. That's it. No potatoes. No rice. No salad. It was just OK. The duck was better. Cost over $18.00.

Add 1 beer and 1 excellent Margarita to that, and the bill was $80. 

Because the service was good, a tip had to be added which brought it up to $90.

Moral to this story - Xola is not even close to worth it. You won't find what you're used to or expect to. If you're open to novelty, you'll be disappointed by what you're served and what you're not.

For the best mexican, its worth the trip to Cielito Lindo in Pickering or Mexican Lindo at 971 O'Connor Dr, Toronto  - the very best. And we could have eaten twice for what I paid.

If you want duck or lamb, better to hit Chinatown or Greek Town respectively."
Xola Mexican Food	5	2018-05-27	Excelente!!!!! I had a great experience at Xola, great service and great food. 100% authentic Mexican food and test. We ordered appetizer Trio, the Duck confit tacos and the Arrechera everything was awesome!!! I definitely will come back!
Xola Mexican Food	5	2018-02-20	My favourite restaurant in the Beach, and some of the best Mexican food in the city. Not the cheapest, but the food is high quality. Great margaritas, guacamole, and tacos. Fish tacos are light and delicate, with a lovely balance of flavours and texture.
Xola Mexican Food	5	2016-08-07	"Absolutely love this place!

Me and my husband have been coming here for years.  The staff is friendly and attentive and the food is delicious.

The prices may shock you at first but all the produce and meat is well sourced and the portions are quite large so you really get what you pay for.  We always make sure to try at least one new thing off the menu whenever we go and are never disappointed.

The food is always fresh and bright and completely satisfying and the close, intimate setting always reminds us of my husband's mother's kitchen. 

A great hidden gem and a must try in the city.  It's definitely worth a walk along Queen street."
Xola Mexican Food	5	2014-08-19	"Very small but very delicious. I have been trying to find the best Mexican food in the city and this one definitely beats out the rest. We goat the goat cheese and sun-dried  guacamole, it was amazing!! The tacos are delicious and just the right portions and amount of spices. 
Also the best margaritas! Definitely recommend the Hibiscus one. 
A hot spot in the beaches for sure!!"
Cinco Mexican Restaurant	5	2020-02-10	I really like the complimentary salsa bar in the restaurant that was paired with the complimentary multi-colored tortilla chips. I ordered the gourmet vegan taco, which I really savored. The chorizo flavored TVP was really delicious. I highly recommend anyone try this restaurant!
Cinco Mexican Restaurant	4	2020-02-03	I absolutely love little unassuming places like cinco. A great addition to the neighbourhood and a little walk from high park. You know this is a great  place when the food is affordable, tasty and authentic! I love the hot sauce choices. The coziness is real here. The only thing is because it is small, it does fill up fast. I highly recommend if your in and around the Roncesvalles neighbourhood! I throughly enjoyed  the carnita and fish tacos I had! Happy eating!
Cinco Mexican Restaurant	4	2019-10-11	Cute restaurant with a large variety of options . We went midday so missed the brunch menu and were too early for dinner menu . We were left with an impressive list of tacos to choose from which were freshly made with just enough spices! Very friendly server who made sure we had a great experience
Cinco Mexican Restaurant	4	2019-02-27	"My husband and I were in the area and thanks to Yelp, we ended up at this cute restaurant. Our visit here definitely didn't disappoint! Upon walking in, the beautiful murals are hard to miss and it's noticeably small with only a few tables but I actually like that about it. There's something great about hole in the wall type places as these very places are often where great food is at and you'll find that's the case here for sure. 

There were so many choices - each of the different tacos sounded delicious! There are street tacos which are smaller in size for about $4 each and there are a few options like chicken, pork, beef, fish, and vegetarian. There are also gourmet tacos which are more of the stars of the menu here since they are bigger in size and there are many more options that the street tacos. Check out the menu as there are too many to name! The gourmet tacos range in price from around $7.99 - $9.00 depending on which one you order. There's something for everyone!

We ended up getting the combined chorizo and beef gourmet taco, as well as the braised pork and pork belly gourmet taco. Both were filling and delicious but the chorizo/beef taco was slightly more flavourful. Complimentary nachos are provided while you wait for your order as well. I also loved how this place has a salsa bar of about six different salsas with different levels of heat. We enjoyed each one but I particularly liked the creamy habanero one. This place is definitely worth a visit!"
Cinco Mexican Restaurant	4	2019-01-20	"Two types of tacos:
Gourmet = two tacos with cheese in middle with loads of stuff inside. About $8 each. I'd say they are better and more complex than the latter, but at $8 is a bit steep.

Street: More simple one tortilla tacos. Still really good and about $4 each.

I'd say in general the tacos are really good. 

The service is quick, though when we were there, there was only one other person so the chef made ours immediately.

The complimentary chips were made on the spot, I saw her frying them while we were there in preparation. Though if you ask for more, it is another $1.50.

The sauces, and get yourself were delicious. I really liked they Mexican mud and the green one, forgot the name."
Cinco Mexican Restaurant	5	2018-10-29	"I honestly don't know why it took us so long to come and try Cinco! We've seen it on yelp and google reviews so many times but finally decided to try it for lunch on Sunday. Located in Roncesvalles is this homey Mexican restaurant. As you walk in, you are pleasantly greeted by the hostess and the chefs. Restaurant isn't too big, and they really only have a couple of tables, i think with the largest table seating 8? Menu is also fair in size, but they have Sunday brunch if you're interested in eggs rather than tacos! We came here specifically for their tacos and salsa bar! 

Hostess/waitress was great in explaining their menu to us. They have 2 types of tacos: Gourmet and Street taco. Gourmet tacos are two tortillas stuffed with cheese in between and then their taco ingredients on top. Street tacos are your typical tacos but with only 1 tortilla. We opted to try one of each. I had the seafood gourmet taco (fish, squid and shrimp) with slaw on top and also the beef street taco. The beef street taco is AMAZING. So flavourful and filled with onions and cilantro on top!! The seafood gourmet taco was good but was nothing overly special in my opinion. My hubby got the rotisserie chicken taco and that was SOOO good. I was first skeptical because rotisserie chicken and tacos together didn't sound appealing, but the sauce, the ingredients, the toppings all combined so well together. Mind you they are not stingy on their meats. They give you a heaping amount and you get really full after one gourmet taco!! The waitress also recommended their churros as they are homemade and lightly dusted with cinnamon. We tried the chocolate filled churro and it was sooooo goood. it comes out pipping hot and with chocolate oozing out. 

Service was also fast and great. They also serve free nacho chips and a help yourself salsa bar which was fun! They had salsa ranging from mild to really spicy. and also had this jalapeno guac that was my fav. I can't wait to return and try their other options!!"
Cinco Mexican Restaurant	5	2019-07-01	The decor, the food, the service and the hardworking owner and staff made this a place we will never forget. Tons of amazing salsa, super authentic food and a cozy home feeling. Top notch and a definite go-to!
Cinco Mexican Restaurant	5	2019-03-11	"What an absolute gem! Had been meaning to write a review and have been here three times so far. The food is incredible. I have Mexican food in LA more often than not and that stuff is amazing ... so I'm always sceptical about what I have over here actually being good. This place is equal to most of my favourites and superior to a few others I have been to over in LA which is saying a lot. 

I really love the diversity of the plates, like whatever you order the sides not only compliment the food but they are plentiful in choice. They even have a salsa bar. 

My only tip would be if you love salsa as passionately as I do ...bring a little plate to the bar so you can load it up with the little salsa cups. 

Long live delicious food!"
Cinco Mexican Restaurant	4	2019-09-01	"First time at Cinco and we were not disappointed. Lots of great things on the menu, so we will definitely be coming back to try more. Also, they have a great salsa bar with a variety of options worth trying. Lively atmosphere, but the service was just a bit slow.
For this first visit, we started with the lime margaritas (FYI that these are frozen, but very good) and the chicken taquitos (good; the shells felt a little tough but all the fresh toppings made up for it).
Then we got the Pollo con mole gourmet taco (very good!) and the enchiladas (3 per order, we couldn't finish it). Trying a different salsa with each bite gives each a unique flavour profile. The morita salsa was my favourite, and the jerk flavoured one is good too.

They also do brunch, and the menu says their cocktail menu is coming."
Cinco Mexican Restaurant	4	2018-08-08	"One of my favourite Mexican restaurants in the city. The menu is mostly tacos but don't judge it's limited appeal.... the tacos are mouthwatering. I had the Pescado (fish) Street tacos and the Cochinita Gourmet Tacos. I would highly recommend the Cochinita Taco even if you're not into pork. The way the pork belly is cooked will have it melting in your mouth. Topped with the braised pork, this taco will leave you wanting to come back for more.

They also make all of their sauces in house which you'll find towards the back of the restaurant. There's quite a variety so ask the chefs nearby what they would recommend with the tacos you order.

Oh and fair warning, their taco sizes are huge especially their Gourmet Tacos. I had one Gourmet and one Street and I had a hard time finishing both. One Gourmet taco or two street tacos are probably a good portion size to have."
Cinco Mexican Restaurant	5	2019-03-15	Amazing lunch specials. They have a very good salsa, you will be impressed with the flavors. Really enjoyed it, will be back and definitely recommend.
Cinco Mexican Restaurant	5	2019-03-08	Excellent Mexican food, great prices, service is amazing ! So happy we had dinner at Cinco and can't wait to go back. Fish tacos and calamari were our favourites. Churros were delish !
Cinco Mexican Restaurant	5	2018-08-24	"It's tough for me to give out five stars but this place is just so great and to top it off (and earn the 5th star) is good value. The flavour in the meat is amazing. Our group had cochinita pibil, beef & carnitas, and fish. Everyone was super happy. Their salsas, a key measure of any Mexican restaurant, are great. 

Best tacos I've had in Toronto, one of the best spots on Roncesvalles. Can't wait to return. It'll be a Ronny staple for our family."
Cinco Mexican Restaurant	4	2017-11-01	"I've been anticipating this restaurant to open since I saw the coming soon signs. Recently opened, I dined in to check it out.

Food: They have a selection of rotisserie chicken (pollo rostizado), gourmet tacos and street tacos. They also have imported Mexican soda (grapefruit, pineapple and other flavours). If you sit in, they give you complimentary nachos and salsa verde! I tried the 1/4 chicken which came with broiled potatoes and three tortillas. The chicken was the star of the plate, it is juicy inside and held a pack of sweet and savoury flavour. 
I left the pescado (fish) street taco for last, it came with two pieces of battered fish, onion, cilantro and one tortilla. I guess I left it out too long, as the fish was not buttery and moist inside. 

Service & atmosphere: The staff are friendly and as I was a first timer they explained the items on their menu. If you want to know more about the food, they'd be glad to share their origins. The murals along the walls are painted with beautiful detail, I could not take my eyes off them.

Price: The 1/4 chicken plate and fish taco was $13.27 altogether. Leaving with a full stomach on that price seems fair to me. The next time I come back, will try the gourmet tacos. This restaurant is a welcomed addition to Roncesvalles!"
Cinco Mexican Restaurant	4	2019-03-08	Ordered the chicken and fish street tacos. Delicious. Probably the best tacos I've actually ever had. Very fresh, well seasoned, not oily. I'd give this place a 5/5 except service was slow and the restaurant is cramped and very cold. Our server was friendly. Washrooms were pretty clean. I'll come back for the tacos hands down.
Cinco Mexican Restaurant	5	2019-09-08	Amazing place! It became my favourite Mexican place! The sauces are amazing! Everything! Price is fair! I loved it!
Cinco Mexican Restaurant	5	2018-05-07	"This is, hands-down, the best mexican food place in Toronto! And I would know!  I live in Cuidad de Mexico, DF, and have travelled (with locals) pretty much every corner of Estados Unidos de Mexico!

In Toronto I've tried every single mexican restaurant in the core (no suburbs), including Los Colibris (high end), Caballito, Grand Electric (fusion), etc. etc.

NONE of the above places are as good as this one. None, even the pricey ones! 

Cinco is a very small restaurant and it gets really busy around brunch on weekends. They have a special brunch menu, but their regular one is also available.  The best items on the menu are tacos and they come in two varieties: specialty (lots of goodies) and regular (simple).  Specialty tacos are around $8 - two are enough for the average guy (150lbs), while the regular are around $5 and you'd probably need three to feel full. They also have a 'salsa bar' with different heat salsas - but they are all sooo goood!!!

The service is good but not servile.  When it gets busy sometimes they forget stuff (no free chips), but just remind them. The flavors of the pork belly and specialty pork are to die for!  I pity the people who don't eat the tastiest meat out there because they are missing on an amazing flavor and texture experience.  The chicken is also good, but the pork is waaay better.  In DF, pork Tacos al Pastor are the main street food, and here they are replicated almost exactly.

Now a word for vegans (one nasty review down the screen, scroll down, you'll find it) - JUST KEEP MOVING!  This is not a restaurant for you!  I can't believe the lady who wrote the review ordered the tacos without meat AND without cheese!!!??? What's left? NOTHING - that's what!  The slow cooked meat with it's juices and mixed with the melted cheese, both soaking into the corny (see what I did there) tortilla is the essence of the food experience here.  During my time in Mexico I didn't meet a single local vegetarian/vegan.  That should tell you about the essence of the cuisine. 

Do yourself a favor and come to this restaurant and eat the dishes as they are written in the menu (no substitutions!) - your taste buds will thank you for hours."
Cinco Mexican Restaurant	5	2019-08-02	Terrific taco lunch today!! Excellent food, staff, and ambience. Will definitely return.
Cinco Mexican Restaurant	5	2018-05-05	"I had a wonderful lunch at Cinco during the Cinco de Mayo gourmet taco special. I arrived just before the lunch crowd and the server was very nice to explain all the specials to me. I ordered both Al pastor (pork) & Marisco (seafood) tacos. Both were very good, packed with flavour and very balanced. Pro tip, try all the different sauce in the back with the tacos. The extra heat makes a big difference.
I will come again for their brunch specials."
Cinco Mexican Restaurant	4	2018-01-20	"Popped into this place around noon and it was absolutely packed. Had a quick look at the menu and thought it was quite nice. We were doing a little food tour on Roncy so didn't want to consume a full meal before we had a chance to sample all of the beautiful offering that the local shops had on offer. 

We walked the stretched and managed find find a few small things to munch on. 

After the walk back, I suggested we get some tacos at Cinco. 

Was provided some awesome tortilla chips at no cost. They had a wide selection of salas at no additional cost as well which was very nice. 

Before I forget, the waitress was exceptional. She had notice that we had popped in earlier and was surprised to see us back a couple hours later. 

The food was spectacular. I ordered the mixed pork 'gourmet' taco - consisting of pork belly, loin and some other delicious ingredients ~$8 and change. My SO ordered the three for $10 and got the fish (2) and beef (1). 

Quite honestly, the food here is delicious and worth the wait. Yes we were there off peak hours and so not everything would have been prepared quickly - so there was a bit of a wait - but it was really delicious (almost as good as Seven Lives in Kensington Market. 

The decor was also very nice and just generally a great experience."
El Catrin Destileria	4	2020-02-09	"We did it! We did the BRUNCH CHALLENGE and won! Today's weather was about -1C and we decided to participate in El Catrin's Brunch Challenge (if you can last throughout your meal on their outside patio, your meal is discounted 50% off!!) 

The whole atmosphere was very cool.  Promptly greeted and showed to our outdoor table!! We were lucky to nab a seat around the fire pit (nice and warm!). 

The brunch overall was so filling and servers brought our 4 course brunch one after another!!

I really enjoyed their huevos, the tomato sauce was yum!"
El Catrin Destileria	3	2020-02-01	"El Catrin is good! Located in the heart of Toronto's Distillery District, it prides itself on its traditional Mexican-style cuisine in a casual, yet oh-so-slightly-upscale atmosphere.

The interior is very tastefully decorated and the restaurant features a large outdoor patio equipped with giant space heaters for colder days.

I went to El Catrin for lunch and tried the Pepito torta while my companion had the Huevos Rancheros. The steak sandwich was really well marinated and super tender. Go for it! Oh, and we had the tableside-made guacamole with the tortilla chips (which turned out to be pretty excellent). You should go for that as well.

There aren't too many great options for food near Corktown/Distillery District, so give El Catrin a try next time you're around."
El Catrin Destileria	4	2020-01-27	"Came here on a chilly Monday night and was surprised by how busy it was! My cousin was in town from Calgary for the night so I wanted to take her somewhere fun like the Distillery, and what better way to warm our chilly January souls than with Mexican food?? 

We are both vegetarian so we did a bunch of share plates, and we were both really happy with the number of options. 

We tried the corn ""esquites"", which was totally not what we were expecting (corn in a shot glass!), but the chipotle aioli it was mixed with was so, so good. I'd buy some in a bottle and take it home if they let me. (Should have asked!)

We also had a good old bowl of tortilla chips, plus the charred cauliflower, which was really good, and the ""La trajinera"" tacos which were also pretty good... though if I'm being picky, I'd love to see at least one more veggie taco option. 

Overall, loved the atmosphere and servers were friendly and helpful. I ended up drinking red wine since I was so cold that night, but I'll definitely be back in the summer to try one of their tequila cocktails (and hopefully snag a seat on that awesome patio)."
El Catrin Destileria	4	2019-12-11	"Food was great service was slow.

Ordered guacamole n chips freshly made smashed in front of you 

Got a michalada wasn't so bad for Canada 

Ordered chicken torta and it was more of gourmet torta which was really good. Came with sliced chicken breast pieces with there chiptole sauce and ciabatta bread. On the spicy side but was really good 

The place is very nice lots of seating, inside and outside but it was snowing outside so all the tables were taken sat on the bar table. Everyone is friendly and nice just didn't wanna wait 45 mins for a torta and chicken burrito."
El Catrin Destileria	5	2020-04-27	Awesome restaurant in the distillery district! The outdoor patio seating is lovely in the summer, and food and drink were all delicious!
El Catrin Destileria	4	2019-08-31	"We came here for dinner on a weeknight, and were seated almost immediately.

We ordered the $15 sopes, which were delicious but came in a really small portion size (only two small pieces). The baja tacos were great, with a light and crispy batter.

Overall, the service and food were good, but it is pricey (understandable though because of its prime location in the Distillery District)."
El Catrin Destileria	3	2020-01-14	Guacamole was good but portions are not that big. The price of dishes are fine. Atmosphere was very nice. For the desert we had churros with chocolate and caramel sauce and they had really good taste and texture. We did waited some extra time for service and we shouldn't, because at that time restaurant wasn't to busy.. No free parking.
El Catrin Destileria	4	2019-08-07	"What a fun little place!!! They have an absolutely beautiful outdoor seating area. I can't think of an ambience much better than sitting outside here on a summer night with a light breeze. Definitely the cutest place in the Distillery District based on just walking around and checking everything out.

The food: Is it overpriced? Absolutely. But I was very pleasantly surprised by its quality and I'm sure you can't get anything cheap in this area. Obviously this isn't some hole in the wall taquería, but for the kind of place this is, the al pastor tacos were great. Super flavorful and tons of pineapple. Much better than whaf I expected. We also ordered chips and guac for the table. There was plenty of guac but an almost laughably small amount of chips, so probably not worth the cost but still good. And of course we enjoyed everything a little more when they brought out our margarita pitcher...

If I'm ever back in Toronto I'd totally come back here. Whether you're coming for dinner or just to grab some drinks and some Instagram pics, this is a good spot."
El Catrin Destileria	5	2019-09-18	"Yum, yum, yum!  I came here with a large group of ladies.  A couple of extra people were added to our reservation on the spot with no problem at all.  We ordered the fixed price menu with 7 courses.  Some of our friends were vegetarian and they were able to make substitutions, also with no problem at all.  

The decor is very cool and artistic.  The large, outdoor patio is great in the summertime and just as lively as inside.  

Delicious food, lovely service.  Can't wait to come back."
El Catrin Destileria	5	2019-09-05	"Loved loved loved this restaurant! 

First off, the ambience was AMAZING! We got there early enough (6pm) where we were able to get a patio table right by the fire. It was so cozy outside and super cute. The chairs and other furniture were funky looking but comfortable. The atmosphere at this place makes it what it is. 

The food and drinks were just as amazing as the ambience though. We ordered a regular and mango margarita. Super good...especially because the mango margarita was actual mango purée and not a syrup. 

The food is served more tapa style, but the specials and tacos could be big enough portions if you aren't super hungry. We ordered the table side guacamole and tuna tostada..both great. For entrees we ordered the quesadilla (I know it sounds weird..but it sounded to amazing to pass up) and the shrimp tacos. Both so so so good! The quesadilla I think was the best as odd as that sounds. The pastor meat in it was bomb! 

Didn't order dessert because we were a tad full...but the churros looked great! I would definitely come here if in the mood for amazing Mexican food and a great environment. Also if you love tequila, lots of options!"
El Catrin Destileria	5	2020-01-10	"Where do I start! This review is long over due as you can see I visited during patio season. They have huge patio with a fire pit! 

This place has the best Mexican food and drinks and needs to be on everyone list of places to check out! I recommend getting a margarita or the horchata colada and tacos and the chips & guac."
El Catrin Destileria	4	2019-08-03	"I love the decor of this place! It has a really Mexican feel. There is an inside and an outdoor patio you can sit at. The restaurant also has a outdoor taqueria if your just grabbing a quick bite and a drink. 

We ordered the chips with table side guacamole. It was made fresh and even grounded up right next to us. Next came the elote that was in small square shot glass size. I ordered the shrimp tacos which were spicy and cooked to perfection. My boyfriend ordered a carne asada dish. He devoured his meal so it must have been very good. 

The staff was very nice and quick. Our food was great and portions are reasonable."
El Catrin Destileria	5	2019-06-18	"I come here several times a year and its still the best! One of my favourite restaurants in Toronto. 

2 years ago they had a dish called the Love Boat which was one of my fav dishes but they discontinued it. I stopped coming as often because of that but decided to revisit for the guac! OH MY GOD. Best.Guac.Ever. They will crush and make the guac in front of you which is a cool personal touch. The flavour is just right! You can taste the hint of lime, the onions and tomatoes! To top it off, the chips they provide are to die for... 

I would also highly recommend the original margarita! One of my favs!! My friend and I once ordered a pitcher and both got pretty drunk off it haha! Perfect amount of tequila in each glass and overall just the perfect amount of sweetness. 

In terms of atmosphere, the inside is pretty dim with loud music. I've sat inside once and can say it is definitely an experience. I did the tasting menu that time, and i believe it was $65/person and you get to experience a bit of everything! Definitely worth it if you have the appetite, I was too full for the best part... the dessert... WHICH TO MENTION, WAS MY FAV PART! I have to talk about the churro.... LITERALLY THE BEST. Nice and thick, with a crunch, very warm, and also the perfect amount of cinnamon sugar! 

Taco portions are also huge. I think I can write an essay because I've tried almost everything on this menu. HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
El Catrin Destileria	5	2019-08-03	"Had a great time here! Yes, like everyone else agrees, the ambiance is 5++. See photos. 

The food is actually quite on point too! My friend who is from Mexico City felt this was very tasty and plans to take her parents here when they come visit from Mexico. Got the guac (fresh they mix it at the table), ceviche trio (refreshing! Good quality seafood and nice flavor combinations), two types of tacos, and the elote which was surprisingly amazing (nothing like the sad mayo based stuff you get on the street). Want to try the deserts but we were too full! 

Service was wonderful too. We got there at 7pm on a Saturday. 1 hour wait for the patio. We went to the bar to get drinks and appetizers and they let us bring our apps outside when our table was ready. Yes we were a little annoying but the girl at the front was very accommodating. Waiter was very attentive and kind :), gave good recommendations."
El Catrin Destileria	4	2019-07-04	"I love the decor of this place! It's so unique. We came here for a company dinner so we had a set menu. It was a lot of food. Everything tasted good. Only one of the dishes was too spicy for me. I liked the simplicity of the food because the taste was just great. Simple doesn't have to mean bland. For a Tuesday evening I didn't expect it to be so busy. But it was very busy. If we didn't have a reservation we would've been waiting a long time I think.

The first item on the set menu is the appetizer of chips & guacamole. It was made fresh & even ground up fresh in a stone bowl. Next came the charred corn off the cobb in a small square shot glass size. Yummy! After that we have the diablito salad with Israeli couscous, then pollo loco (chicken taco), baja (fish taco), squid & chorizo kebab, and then churros for dessert. I had a mushroom taco since I'm allergic to fish. They are able to customize for those with allergies. I'm lactose intolerant & allergic to fish. So I had different items than what was on the set menu.

Waitstaff were quick & nice. Everyone has to wear red on top it seems. I think only the managers didn't wear red. The old wood reminds of reclaimed wood from ships. But apparently it was reclaimed from the old distillery buildings. I'd come here to eat again & I actually want to bring hubby here to try the food."
El Catrin Destileria	4	2019-12-14	"Love, love, love this place. 

There are not a lot of great Mexican restaurants in Toronto.
Look no further than this spot for a great meal.

Their ceviche and fish tacos are da bomb..
Margaritas come in a variety of flavors and as a single drink or by the pitcher.

Do not miss the churros as a finish.  They come with multiple dipping sauces and are great!

They have a great patio in the summertime. 
It gets busy too!  

It's located in the Distillery District.  Green P parking right on the site at a fee. 
This area has a lot of cobblestone walkways so leave the high heels at home."
El Catrin Destileria	4	2019-12-05	This restaurant is gorgeous, one of my favourite patios and restaurant designs in the city. Even the menu is beautifully designed. It is very cozy and colourful. It kind of reminds me of the movie coco. I think it's a nice addition to the distillery district. The only thing is I find it a bit on the pricier side but it makes sense given the location. The food is also delicious here, I had the baja and carnita tacos which were both done really well, packed with flavour.  Try it at least once if your in the area :)
El Catrin Destileria	5	2019-05-29	"we ordered the seven course tasting menu for two, and it was so much food that I'd say I had a solid second trimester food baby: 
-Pepita adobo dip. A nice change of pace from Guacamole and chips
-tuna ceviche
-quinoa queso fresco salad
-handmade tortillas with fresh with and cabbage
-carne Assad's corn tacos
-braised beef with mole
-churros

And a watermelon margarita- delicious!"
El Catrin Destileria	3	2019-10-19	"Would give the drinks a 4/5. Extremely slow wait (~14 minutes to get our drinks). Also asked to remove agave from one of our drinks and the waiter did not communicate that properly to his bar tender - so we got stuck with agave in one of our drinks even though we asked to remove it. 

Not worth the wait. Take your business elsewhere. Did not try the food so I can't give any insight to that."
El Catrin Destileria	4	2019-09-22	"We came on a Saturday afternoon when the patio was relatively crowded. Even so, it was a brief 10 minute wait to be seated. The patio was very cozy and the decor and ambiance was beautiful. We started with the Esquites, which was an extremely small portion, but tasty with just the right amount of spice. As our main course we chose the Pollo Loco chicken tacos, which were fresh, tender and delicious. 

The only thing about our visit that was not fantastic was that it took a substantial amount of time (20+ minutes) for our entrees (the two tacos) to arrive, and the waiter (in the nicest way) stopped by multiple times to let us know he would be checking on our order.

Overall a great place to satisfy your Spanish/Mexican food craving, and definitely worth a repeat visit!"
Comal y Canela	5	2020-05-06	"A lovely little local gem (which of course I discovered thanks to Yelp)!

We visited before COVID times for take out and this tiny place was packed (there are really only about 10 seats or so here). I believe they are offering curbside pick up but please call to make sure!

The lady, who I assumed was the owner, was really lovely and sweet. She took her order and we waited outside the shop so we weren't hovering over the seated peeps enjoying their meals.

Our order was assembled quickly. The lady who took our order also threw in a cheese enchilada for us to try, which was so lovely!

The food was absolutely delicious, the right amount of heat and the food items were packaged with care. Will definitely come back in the future for a sit down meal!"
Comal y Canela	5	2019-12-27	"I have nothing to add. The food here is superb, in particular the birria and carnitas. Tacos, nachos / guac are excellent as well. Their dark mole had an undeniably deep flavour but was a bit too chocolatey for my taste. 

It's not ""cheap"" but what do you expect for a place that makes its own tortillas from scratch and spends a day cooking a stew or 30-ingredient mole?"
Comal y Canela	5	2020-05-22	This is the best Mexican food that we have experienced outside of Mexico (where we live 5 months of the year). Not only is the food fantastic, but this establishment 'gives back' to the community through their efforts at helping underprviledged people and families through their foodbank initiatives. Additionally, the level of customer service is second to none. The owner(s) and staff are very lazer focused on customer satisfaction and take tremendous pride in their food. Bravo!
Comal y Canela	4	2019-05-02	"Updated to a 4 Star. :) Came back for some more tacos and they were very good

This is a tiny and homey place. It's the size of a small room and probably can't house more than 10-12 people but its charm makes up for its size. 

Unfortunately, our server did not understand English but luckily, a kind patron translated for us. Despite the language barrier, we did receive friendly service. Some of the other patrons even asked us how we located this place which is when we got to bring up the awesomeness of Yelp haha. :D 

The food was good but wasn't stand-out. I have had better gobernador tacos and chicken enmoladas elsewhere. I was also a little sad that there wasn't any salsa to put on the tacos so it was missing that spicy kick. However, the warm atmosphere has compelled me to return to try their other interesting dishes like the pressed pork in guajillo and their Mexican brunch. So I'd still be willing to return and who knows, you may expect to see an updated review sometime. :)"
Comal y Canela	5	2019-10-27	Simply amazing. Lovely people and delicious food. Petite and cute spot. Goat stew stood out particularly
Comal y Canela	3	2019-03-10	"Don't expect a Chipotle/Taco Bell type place!

Parking:  There is drive-thru parking for this plaza, but lot was full of deep potholes.  It's best to park on Macdonald Ave.  It's a small residential street, just north of Lawrence.

Restaurant itself is SMALL.  There are 4 tables and a counter with a few stools.  Restaurant opens early for Desayunos.

I believe this restaurant specialises in Michoacan food, the birthplace of canitas, low and slow cooked meats, and stews such as pozole.  Prices for specialty items were on the ""higher end"", e.g. pozole was $15 and a Michoacano Burrito (snout-to-tail, slow cooked pork), $15.  There wasn't much sauce in the burrito itself, no rice, just meat.  It was nicely cooked, but quite porkie.

Overall, the tastes are quite different than, let's say, your typical taco places downtown.  It's more about regional cooking.

Area seems a bit rough, so some of the prices did surprise me.  Ok to try, but I wouldn't drive out of my way (esp at night) to head there!"
Comal y Canela	5	2020-01-09	Having lived in the states enjoying variety of authentic Mexican food, after moving back to Toronto, I have been fairly disappointed and greatly missed real Mexican food. Coma y Canela saved me. Their food is purely authentic. They make everything home made, even the Mole sauce. You will never be disappointed eating here. The only thing is there are not enough seating and you may have to wait for seats if you visit during busy lunch/dinner time.
Comal y Canela	5	2020-03-01	If you walk by too fast and you'll miss the store!  It is a very small shop with all sorts of Mexican delights!  It is located directly across from a major subway stop, Dufferin station.  We pre ordered Rosca de Reyes for the new year and it was amazing.  What they don't have at this location can be found in their larger store.   Well worth the stop
Comal y Canela	5	2019-05-05	"Three visits to this place so far, and we've gotten the enmoladas (chicken mole enchiladas) each time. The mole sauce is addictive; The blend of spices, chilis, and chocolate is rich, creamy, and balanced. 

If you're looking for the next level of shareable nachos, the asada chilaquiles is a mammoth portion of salsa poured over tortillas and topped with steak, cheese, cream, avocado, and beans on the side. 

They also have a tasty carnitas, a solid birria and pozole, along with various tacos (we liked the gobernador and the cochinita so far). 

Most of the dishes come with three types of salsa, onions, limes, and cilantro to dress your food with.

For drinks, I'd recommend the Jamaica, a hibiscus iced tea, and the Tepache, fermented pineapple juice and piloncillo. They have a lower level of sweetness, which was appreciated."
Comal y Canela	4	2019-03-15	"The food is great, and I am Mexican. This is the most authentic mexican food I've ever tried in Toronto so far. 
The inconvenience is the location, it's a headache to find a parking spot, and the place is tiny. If you're lucky you will find a table where to sit. But definitely should give it a try !"
Comal y Canela	5	2020-02-01	"Absolutely amazing food. We got 4 things - sopes, enchiladas, guacamole and chips and shrimp tacos. All the items were delicious but the sopes was above and beyond my expectations. We didn't get a chance to try the mole as they were sold out but we will be back to try it. The guacamole and chips was fresh, a great balance of acid and salt and an overall great starter - especially when you have a dish as rich as the shrimp tacos. We also bought two drinks and out of the two, the cucumber lime was a wonderful, refreshing addition to the meal. Both were wonderful though.

The owner is the absolute sweetest person and proudly stands behind every menu item. She patiently described every menu item we asked about in extreme detail to ensure we got exactly what we would love (honestly we'd probably love everything). 10/10 would recommend to anyone."
Comal y Canela	4	2019-05-10	"I went here because it was virtually the only option when I did a search for birria in Toronto. Unfortunately, when I got there at 10am, they didn't have the goat birria ready yet, so I had to have beef instead. I'll try not to hold that against them. It was good enough that I'm hoping to return for the goat. Super tender, and fresh and hot.

Downsides are that the tortillas aren't as fresh (not bad, but not obviously handmade), and the broth for the birria is more of a salty tomato base than a drinkable mole. But it's still excellent quality for what it is."
Comal y Canela	5	2019-05-30	Best food I had. It's a must try and good services I would recommend to anyone that's curious to go there as soon as possible, worth the price and time
Comal y Canela	5	2018-10-01	Wowwwwwww this place is BOMB. First of all, everything is in Spanish and if you come here, you should speak Spanish. They can speak English, but like... it's part of the experience. Speak Spanish if you can. The food was AH.MAZE.ING. Wow. The tacos were perfect. They gave us a lot of hot sauce and I must warn you - try the hot sauce first. Don't just put it in your mouth or on your food. It's extremely spicy. We had some Spanish ballads playing in the background and horchata to match (the horchata was great for dealing with that spicy hot sauce, too). The place is very small and it doesn't serve alcohol. Maybe try take out?
Comal y Canela	5	2018-08-28	"I've scoured the city for amazing Mexican and no matter where I go, I'm always disappointed. Every 4 and 4.5 star place on Yelp has left me shaking my head, wondering how anyone could be satisfied with such mediocre food.

Today, my long drought has ended because I found what is, by far, the best Mexican food in Toronto. I really don't think any words can explain how much better this place is than the restaurants you'll find in Kensington and elsewhere. The chorizo, carnita and campechano tacos made me think of the absolute best food I've had in Mexico. The pozole was perfect. I was blown away. If you think this praise is so effusive as to be hyperbolic, go check it out and tell me I'm crazy. I'll wait..."
Comal y Canela	5	2019-07-25	This place is authentic, as authentic as it gets. I loved the campechano tacos - really amazing presentation and salsas variation to aadd on top. Love it! It's just sooo small. But even so, worth it!
Comal y Canela	5	2019-06-13	"Always service with a smile at this incredibly clean and tidy little restaurant! The customer service is second to none with this authentic Mexican food! The seating area is very small and cozy, and impeccably clean, and the food is DELICIOUS. Tacos, fresh tortilla chips, AMAZING guacamole, so many ingredients made fresh in house, and the spicy sauces are actually spicy! The tortillas are fresh and delicious as well. 

We ordered a huge takeout order for our office, and they made it very quickly! Everything was well organized and it was a hit! I can't recommend this restaurant enough. I will definitely be coming back."
Comal y Canela	5	2019-03-09	One of the hidden gems in the city .. it's so homey and gives you a welcoming ambience .. the food is really great, tasty and loved the tacos .. the ladies there were so helpful and very attentive .. I would be coming back again .. parking is pretty tricky but they are street parking one block behind the store ..
Comal y Canela	5	2019-04-09	"Hospitality class should use this restaurant as an example! Food is really yums, and definitely fulfilled my cravings.

 If you're looking for authentic Mexican restaurant, this is it. And if you'd like an introduction to Mexican cuisine, they will gladly guide you through their English or Spanish menu."
Comal y Canela	5	2019-11-03	We read the good reviews and decided to give it a try this morning. We weren't disappointed. The space is small, cozy and well-appointed. The food was very reasonably priced and excellent. We had the breakfast; the quality and the price were really unbeatable. Superb restaurant.
Quetzal	5	2020-02-27	"Mr.H and I were here for a celebratory dinner, right when you walk in this place has a modern and minimalist ambiance, very different from most other mexican restaurants. Like really... I did not see one decorative skull. Lol

I tried two cocktails, the Primaverde and a special for the day called Breakfast in Mexico. Both were amazing!

For food we tried the below:

Tuna Tostada - yummy... the sesame and spice on this really makes it unique.

Seafood cocktail - Mr.H loved it but this was my least favorite dish. I thought it was too tart to enjoy. 

Lamb Masa - One of my favorite from the night, the lamb was so beautifully cooked, extremely delicious. A must try if you love lamb.

Beets - This was ordered from the greens section of the menu and was surprisingly very tasty. The creamy base and seasoning made it a perfect pairing with the grill pork.

Grill Pork - OMG! Served with roasted pineapple and a caramelized onion sauce it was what you'd call ""melts-in-your-mouth"" deliciousness!!! 

I'd heard their meats are amazing so I'm excited to try this place again and maybe have the beef next time. 

The service was perfect and I've certainly added this place to my list of must trys in Toronto."
Quetzal	5	2020-02-14	"Loved loved everything! I loved how they serve smaller portion so I could try more dishes. 

Sweetbread is a must try! It is a veal dish with black garlic sauce. It just melted in my mouth. This dish was my fav  the grilled runner bean was amazing too. It tasted so good with sweetbread.

I would definitely go back to try other dishes."
Quetzal	5	2020-01-23	"By far, the best fancy mexicanish food I've ever had! 

We ordered so many dishes - I dont think I can post the names of all the things we ordered! Came here for a birthday dinner and turned out great! The cocktails are mindblowing - theres many new kinds of liquers you can try here! 

The food is amazing! All the food served at quetzal is grilled on Charcoal! Can you imagine the char on that beautiful steak!!!! My mouth waters as I write this review. The menu can be confusing but our server- Brad - so amazing - suggested all the right things! 

 We tried all three desserts on the menu ! I think chocolate one was my least fav! 

Definitely visiting this place again to try the other things on the menu!"
Quetzal	4	2020-01-22	"Every dish I ate here, I had a genuine mmmm. 
Such interesting flavours, pretty presentation and attentive service. So good! One of the dishes had peanuts which wasn't listed on the menu (...) BUT they were able to replace it right away due to an allergy. 
We came here on a Friday night and was able to grab a sit fairly easily. Dishes range between $15-30 and are meant to be shared. I would go back! But maybe for special occasions only."
Quetzal	3	2019-12-03	"I was very excited about trying Quetzal. Upon arrival the ambiance was great, with candlelit tables and a curved ceiling, like being inside of a ship. The bar seating was inviting and the drinks menu was inventive and cocktails were superior with great notes for sipping.

For the food we did the tasting menu, since there were many unique dishes that we wanted to try. The sea bream and scallop ceviche was underwhelming, with the scallops being were quite small and not fresh tasting. The other sushi grade fish - the kanpchi tiradito - was good in comparison. The thin crispy Masa round was similar to a taco pizza, and a fun app to share. 

Next up, the kale salad was tasty and served with the full stems. The bone marrow came with two large bones but didn't seem to have enough flavour cooked into it. Lastly, the skirt steak and 18oz rib eye were served. We were never asked how we liked it cooked when ordering, but we received medium rare which worked out to our tastes. 

Overall, great value for a lot of food and high quality ingredient based dishes, but nothing stood out at the end of the night. I was hoping for a little more bite. 

It's a beautiful restaurant otherwise, and maybe I'm just not the right fit for palette."
Quetzal	3	2019-08-15	"Quetzal is interesting. There's this big huge space that goes for miles with a glimpse into kitchen. At the front, there's a huge table with natural light, and the bar is impeccably stocked and gorgeous. We sat at the bar, and it was fun conversing with our server who was full of quips and stories. His drinks were equally interesting. 

The food though, for Mexican just wasn't as great as the rest of the restaurant itself. Things were plated prettily (maybe a bit oddly), but nothing popped our taste buds as Mexican flavours should. It was just an okay meal. We left a bit hungry and wanting more."
Quetzal	3	2018-12-22	"I had high expectations for this restaurant based on other reviews but for me, it ended up being just an average meal. 

The restaurant itself is very nice inside. The decor is unique and the feel of the restaurant is upscale yet welcoming. Staff are very friendly and professional. I don't particularly enjoy the high seats we had, but that's just me. The menu is a bit confusing so we had a lot of questions, and our server was happy to explain. There were four of us dining and we had intended on ordering our own food, but apparently this restaurant suggests more of a ""family style"" dining experience. I feel that this is a lazy way of serving, as you're basically told that they don't care about timing your food to come out together, so it's suggested you share whatever comes out first. Not my favourite way to eat when I'm dining with people I don't know very well.

One of the guys at our table wanted to order a drink that was under the ""Large Format"" heading, which our server explained was meant to share. She also said it could be served as a single drink if he wanted. I read the description (Velvet Krush) and decided I'd also like to try it. When our drinks were brought out, it was served as a single drink with two straws. I don't know what made her think that two people sitting on opposite ends of the table from each other would want to share a drink like that, but we sent it back requesting two separate glasses. Even if we had been a couple, I would not want to share a drink like that. Very strange. At least the drink was really good. Something I would definitely have again. 

We ordered a few ceviche dishes to start. Most of the dishes were good, but at this price point, I honestly expected to be wowed at least with some of the dishes. The presentation was exceptional, which is probably why I was disappointed, as I expected everything to taste as good as it looked. I did enjoy the scallop ceviche - probably my favourite dish of all the ones I tried. 

I had the hanger steak as my main with a side of grilled mushrooms. The steak was cooked rare, which I found to be a bit rubbery. Had it been cooked a bit more to mid-rare, it probably would have been perfect. Because they sliced the steak before bringing to the table, there's not much you can do to salvage it, aside from ordering a new one. Given the two-hour window they impose, I wasn't prepared to chance it, as we were over 2/3 of our time already. The mushrooms also looked better than they tasted, as I felt the broth kind of watered down the mushroom flavour rather than enhancing it. I also tasted the grilled fish and the coal roasted sweet potato, but neither was to my liking. It seemed like the char from the grill kind of overpowered everything else. 

At the end of the meal, there was nothing really outstanding for me. I'd return if I was with other people who wanted to try it, but can't say I'd rush back anytime soon."
Quetzal	5	2020-01-05	"This restaurant fills two gaps in Toronto:
1) a modern take on Mexican cuisine 
2) a casual fine dining restaurant with an interesting take on both meat and seafood 

This restaurant also has some of the most knowledgeable and service oriented wait staff I have ever encountered. I recommend not reading the menu at all and let the staff and chef curates tasting menu for you (at $65-75 per person plus tax). I have done that 3 times and every time they come up with a sequence of very thoughtful dishes that take the guests dietary reactions in consideration, with great variations that changes according to season. 

The latest hit for me is their special lobster appetizer. Where they grill the whole lobster with spice and matcha. The right amount of heat balanced with the fresh taste of the lobster. Never saw lobster handled this way. Bravo! 

This is a spot suitable for dates and groups of 4-8. Very nice atmosphere."
Quetzal	5	2019-09-03	"Finally a Mexican restaurant in Toronto that is moving the cuisine scene from $10 of poor quality, to high quality/high value dining. 

They seem to have the formula down right here in terms of the atmosphere, the service, and the quality. The space is narrow and beautifully designed to maximize the diner experience, without overcrowding. Service is impeccable and comfortable - there's a genuineness to lengths the servers will go to ensure you're happy. In terms of quality of food - all I can say is excellent. You've got lots of authenticity here, and some creativity that does't disrespect the cuisine or bastardize it. 

A must visit. The hype is worth it."
Quetzal	4	2019-10-22	"While we are Mexican cuisine aficionados, our experience with the food hasn't strayed far from the quotidian comforts of Chipotle and Taco Bell. The concept of haute Mexican cuisine was entirely foreign to us. 

We were seated at the bar, which which is at the front of this incredibly beautiful restaurant. The restaurant features low ceilings and incredibly soft lighting that gave it a very romantic feel. This place is seriously Instagram-friendly.

Mixto ceviche: 3/5 This was the biggest disappointment of the night. I love a good ceviche, and I was so excited to try this after seeing pics on other bloggers' feeds about the Mixto. When it arrived, the dishes didn't match: there was less than half the amount of scallops as the blog post I referenced from a year ago. The dish itself was pretty good - it was halibut + scallops in a sour, acidic bath.

Citrus salad 4/5 We really enjoyed this salad, and the simplicity in ingredients really surprised us. It featured grapefruit, navel oranges, and a green salsa. Atop the oranges were sous vide chayote slices to give it a light crunch. 

Blue corn masa cakes 5/5 This dish was the highlight of our night. The consistency of the cakes was absolutely amazing - it was crispy yet soft at the same time. It's hard to believe that this was a vegetarian dish; the mushrooms were extremely juicy and worked perfectly with the cheese. We could've eaten 5 of these each.

Sweet potato 3/5 This dish was highly recommended on yelp, but it wasn't fantastic. The yam was good, but tasted boiled - the smoke didn't really get through. The sauce was good - it resembled Lao Gan Ma closely - a Chinese black bean peanut paste. Overall, things didn't really mix together. If you do get this though, make sure to order a batch of tortillas to make sweet potato tacos!

To sum up our critique of this place, we think it's fallen to the classic trap that fancy establishments fall prey to when trying to modernize a classic cuisine: losing the integrity of the flavours. Everything felt too refined, not punchy enough. While we understand the value of restraint and nuance, we can't help but think that the fieriness that defines Mexican cuisine was overly diluted. Quetzal ranked 23 out of Canada's best 100 restaurants. While it was a tasty meal, we wouldn't put it in our top 50. 

Also there's only 1 washroom. This means long lines. Don't hold it in."
Quetzal	5	2019-06-26	"It's hard for most to imagine Mexican cuisine without defaulting to tacos, nachos, and burritos. Come to Quetzal to see that it is so much more.

The low sloping ceiling creates a cozy atmosphere that makes you forget you're on busy College Street. The entire staff was warm, inviting, and knowledgeable.

If you're in a party if 2-3 and want to try a variety of dishes, they offer smaller sizes of most dishes. If you're unsure what to order, simply tell them any dietary restrictions and your budget, and they will gladly curate a tasting menu for you.

We ordered 6 items, 3 of which were adjusted to smaller portions. Favourite dishes were the grilled scallops and grilled skirt steak. For a good time, dip that steak in the scallops' butter sauce."
Quetzal	4	2019-05-16	"We had an amazing time here ! Sat in the back at the chefs table which was so fun to watch the action. It was also nice to chat with the chefs. Some people mentioned it was quite warm - they did have some serious fans going on back there but it is warmer than usual. Keep that in mind if you're sensitive to heat but I was very comfortable. I think these reservations go fast so book early if you wish! 

We ordered five dishes: two masa (chicken and mushroom), roasted sun chokes, octopus and chorizo. The real stand out was the octopus, this was incredible. Served with pineapple and squash and a spicy sauce. Chorizo and sun chokes were also absolutely delicious. Both masas were a little more on the plain side and my least favourite of the dishes but still quite tasty. Each dish had absolutely bomb cremas, salsas, and sauces which added more depth. 

Lastly, the service was on point. A little slow at times but it was actually nice because there were so many choices on the menu. What stood out to me was our server pointed out we had ordered quite a lot of food and offered to give us a half portion of the sunchokes. I have never been told I ordered too much at a small plates restaurant so this really impressed me. We opted for no dessert but it was my birthday so the server bought us out dessert anyway which was also a very kind gesture. The dessert was a chocolate sorbet with passion fruit which was quite interesting. 

I highly recommend this place and I will definitely return to try more dishes."
Quetzal	4	2019-12-17	"So long story short I love it! Like really really really great experience. 
The food is obvs amazing. I love how their menu is set up, and the selection is fantastic. Their twist on some of the traditional Mexcian dishes is very superb. Service was impeccable. Our server was extremely knowledgeable fo all the menu items and food preparation. 
Cocktails are amazing as well. 100% Taste was great. Although a bit too pricy. The wine is overpriced too, which I guess it's typical for this type of restaurant. But that's where you lost the fifth star - overpriced alcohol."
Quetzal	5	2019-08-22	"I think most of the yelp reviews are quite fair and appropriate - you can believe the hype on this place. :)

Ordered:
Green Salad - this was a bit boring, i would choose something more interesting on the next run
 
Coal Roasted Sweet Potato - a huge surprise, this was delicious - totally threw me off-guard

Whole Cornish Hen - very tasty and a good size portion

Calamari - I will be ordering this (and the sweet potato) the next time I visit 

Added a couple of cocktails and the dinner came to just over $100 before tip - which is about average these days..

If you can get a chance, sit at the chef's table and check out all their menu first hand. Next visit I plan to try the seabream and the steak & leeks..."
Quetzal	4	2018-11-16	"Went on a Sunday, early evening, walked in and ate at the bar. 

My friend and I were impressed with the bartender who was great at describing the food menu and great with suggestions. We thought he had better service than Alo bar at Yorkville. We also had Alo / Aloette staff sitting beside us. They, of course, had industry treatment, super friendly to each other. 

Food was good. Ordered the Masa with the mushrooms with it, enjoyed the salsas with it. The Lamb melts in your mouth, very fatty so you really need the right salsa / acid to go with it. The mushroom was solid as most reviewers had said. The broth was very flavourful but there is something gritty and slightly bitter at the end on the bottom of the bowl.  We ordered two desserts, one was a chocolate and pear sauce pairing. Not heavy nor too sweet. The second one was a daily special, they call it a Nutella bread with hot chocolate. This hot chocolate is NOT thick, but had a the right spice like in a chai that balances the bread that is a bit on the dry side but the homemade nutella inside was divine!

The atmosphere is fun. The decor is amazing. The staff was really good."
Quetzal	5	2019-09-08	Say at the chef bar and that gave us a real appreciation for how much everyone really cared. Everything was wood fire cooked, it authentic and absolutely packed with flavour. The architecture of the restaurant is immaculate and a must see. I'd recommend this for a professional night out or a date.
Quetzal	4	2019-06-22	After a recent trip to the Yucatan and experiencing authentic Mexican wood-fired cuisine, I have been on a mission to find similar flavours in the city of Toronto. From the moment you walk into the restaurant, Hands down quetzals interior design is beautiful. The sloped ceiling creates an inviting appearance to the dining room and the open fires at the back, fill the space with a smell that instantly indicated that I was in the right place. We ordered many tastes from the menu. We started with several veggie dishes including the grilled asparagus, green salad and grilled runner beans. The favourite from the veggie dishes were the runner beans. They have a similar bite to cactus without the slimey texture. The addition of coconut and cotija cheese added unique flavours and textures to the earthy veggies. The restaurant makes its own masa based dishes and we opted for the Mamelas and the empanada. Both dishes were gluten free and delicious. The mamelas were a flavour bomb with trumpet mushrooms and a cheese sauce. For meat, we had the chorizo, steak and sweet breads. To be honest, the steak was a bit chewy and not a favourite of the group. The sweet breads however, were unreal. I have never had sweet breads before and the way that they were prepared at quetzal proved just how delicious a organ meat can be. For dessert we had the avocado ice cream with GRASSHOPPERS and a passion fruit mousse. I never thought I would enjoy grasshoppers but they truly added the most unique texture in contrast to the smooth creamy ice cream. All in all, quetzal puts an elegant spin on true traditional Mexican fare...this place is worth a visit and the hefty bill.
Quetzal	4	2019-08-20	Really delicious food that takes a twist on traditional Mexican cuisine. Tried the mixto ceviche, sweet potato, salad, octopus and wagyu beef steak. Beautiful interior, not too dark, not too loud. 4 stars given due to prices but food is 5/5!
Quetzal	4	2018-08-26	"I serendipitously passed by Quetzal in early August after dinner while walking along College with my girlfriend. The warm and dazzling interior immediately drew our attention. We were both full at that point, but we both agreed to return again soon, if at minimum to experience the stunning interior architecture.

The next day, my girlfriend returned to Montreal, where she would be based until late September, and I was left longing to try Quetzal. One week later, I found myself in the College St area again, visiting an old friend. Like any proper foodie boyfriend, I couldn't resist temptation, and ventured into Quetzal that night with my friend instead. Was it worth it to forsake my better half and visit Quetzal without her to satisfy my craving? I'd say yes. :-)

I could write paragraphs about Quetzal's beautiful interior design, but a picture is worth a thousand words - so perhaps you should review the photos. The owners of Quetzal did not cut any corners when designing the restaurant. Their use of curved walls, diffused lighting and an open-concept kitchen made an otherwise tight and low-ceiling restaurant feel very spacious. The area was very warm and inviting, and elegantly set the mood for dinner. And trust me, the design was justification enough for visiting. 

The service was also among the best I've  experienced in Toronto - a city whose servers I too often find rude or complacent. Subtle behaviors by the waiters demonstrated Quetzal's commitment to great service. For example, shortly after my friend went to the restroom, a waiter took the care to refold my friends linen napkin. Another example was when I flagged a waiter down about a broken soap dispenser in the men's washroom, and a worker was brought nearly immediately to fix the contraption. Above all, the servers were very friendly and helpful at every interaction. The restaurant was adequately (if not over-) staffed, and at the end of the day, an experienced and friendly restaurant staff is a large part of what any restaurant bill *should* be going towards.

And the food. It was delicious. Quetzal provides traditional Mexican fare, sometimes combined with Canadian accents. I tried the following: Ceviche Verde Mixto (a fresh combination of of scallop and halibut seasoned with a lime base), poblano+Silil pak+ajo salsas (three salsas with exquisite flavors that can be eaten with fresh restaurant made tortillas or reserved for a later course), chorizo toluqueno (three generous pieces of flavorful chorizo), pescado zarandeado (an entire butterflied fish, seasoned with red and green chili sauce), and pollito estillo sinaloa (butterflied wood oven cooked chicken served with luscious roasted mini potatoes and avocado sauce). 

One feedback about the food was that I found it a bit too subtle sometimes and a bit too unsubtle other times. For example, the ceviche tasted too limey, but the chili flavor on the fish or the avocado sauce on the chicken didn't pack enough punch. Another feedback is that some of our dishes were slightly overcooked. However, I believe that these dishes will be fine tuned over time, and I didn't consider these ""issues"" significant enough to stop me from enjoying the food. In fact, I look forward to returning to try the sweetbread, lamb and vegetable dishes that I was unable to try during my first visit.

Quetzal is an ambitious upscale Mexican restaurant venture that is sure to impress across a variety of dimensions - food, service and design. Quetzal gets it and does not compromise on experience. I recommend going with 3-4 friends and ordering a bunch of different plates to try a bit of each."
Quetzal	5	2019-07-07	"I loved this place and will come back every time im in toronto.

We had the asparagus dish, sweet potato with peanuts and pea shoots, triangular corn masa, white bean dip, skirt steak, sunchokes. EVERYTHING was awesome. The drinks were also good. 

Every accomopanying sauce made each dish exponentially better. I wanted to lick the sauce clean off of the plates.

You have to try it."
La Marquesita	5	2019-04-25	"I recently visited La Marquesita, and I have to say I really enjoyed their taquito, they lightly pass the tortilla through oil (makes it a little crunchy) and the filling for the beef is incredibly delicious -- spice levels can also be adjusted to your own taste. Whilst I haven't tried much else on the menu, the one thing I did have was pretty legit. I'd put it above the beef taco at 7 lives which is currently top rated in Toronto right now. Looking forward to going back! 

If you're hesitant to try due to limited reviews, I hope my suggestion urges you to try!"
La Marquesita	4	2019-09-04	"They're a small street-side vendor serving taquitos, gringas, nachos, chilaquiles, and tortas. I had the 2 taquitos combo which came with pop for $10.99 before tip. I only tried the Mazatlan fish taquitos since they had to be the same variety, but they were quite good. Freshly fried, crispy and mildly spicy, the fish was was topped with chipotle mayo and guacamole sauce. I'd like to try the campechano taquitos next time. 

The prices may be a bit high for individual items, but they do have combos such as the 3 taquitos for $14.99. They're a good option near the Ryerson campus."
La Marquesita	3	2019-05-18	"Food (3/5): decent. The corn chips were nice and crispy but the toppings were lacklustre in taste. There also wasn't enough sauce and cheese to cover the chips 

Price (2.5/5): a bit over priced for what you get 

Ambiance (3.5/5): quaint and cute decor, in a good location. No seating though!

Service (4/5): got this to go through ritual, the food was made fresh and there was only a very brief wait!"
La Marquesita	3	2019-06-03	"The place is a small take away joint near Ryerson University, a one amongst many others serving different cuisines. It is an open seating arrangement with 4 large picnic tables and the food carts around it. It was a nice sunny, windy day, perfect to get some spicy food.  Between the three of us we got

CHICKEN TEQUITA: a deep fried taco with guacamole and chicken. Could have been slightly more spicy. It was well marinated. 

CARNITAS TORTAS: this was delicious, a big CARNITAS loaded sandwich served with some nachos on the side. 

I like my Mexican to be slightly more spicy and a little more tangy, this was alright but I have had better and would keep experimenting till I find the flavor."
La Marquesita	4	2019-04-29	"Tucked at the corner right outside of the Ryerson SLC is this shack. Don't let its appearance fool you though, they serve up taquitos with quality ingredients.

While I was snacking on my Monterrey Steak Taquito, the owner was super chill and chatted about how he sources most his ingredients from Mexico and really strives for quality over quantity when it comes to the fillings he cooks up. I could tell he was telling the truth with the tender steak and crisp tortilla I bit into. He also puts in JUST the right amount of filling! Only thing I would critique on is that I'd prefer a guacamole with a thicker consistency."
La Marquesita	5	2019-02-24	"THIS PLACE IS PHENOMENAL!!!!

Everything from the customer service to the delicious food. I ordered two chicken Puebla tacos  and two carnitas tacos. They were fresh, tasty, and hit all the right flavours. Simple and authentic tacos which heavily focused on good quality meat with minimal filler other than some fresh pico and/or pickled onions (this is how tacos are supposed to be). I came back about 20 minutes later and ordered 4 more tacos because they're were literally THAT good. 

Please check this place out. These guys are legit! The dude wearing the supreme hat was super nice and knowledgeable about the food he was serving. I will definitely be going back very very soon. And I have honestly told everyone about this little place. A solid 10/10. I heard they do catering! Check this place out for sure if you're ever in the downtown area around Ryerson. La Marquesita is a hidden gem!"
La Marquesita	4	2019-09-04	I ordered the pulled pork Campechano Torta which was on special through Ritual eats. It's sort of like a taco one a sandwich was interesting to try. The bread is toasted till it's crunchy which helps prevent it from getting soggy from the salsa's and sauces. The meat was tender and came in a good quantity. One of the salsas was a bit overpowering compared to everything else, but otherwise the sandwich meshed well. Not sure if I would pay full price, since it didn't come with a side chips or anything like that, but as a one off meal I definitely enjoyed it.
La Marquesita	3	2019-04-08	"4 stars for their crispy beef tacos, 2 stars for their very greasy veggie tacos. I prefer their crispy tacos to those at the Haam.

Honestly, their crispy tacos are pretty solid, but they need serve it yourself salsa to really bring them together and put them over the top. I'll probably bump this to 4 stars once they do let customers add their own salsa.

Otherwise, you'll still likely get better tacos than you're expecting from this tiny shack across from the Eaton Centre."
La Marquesita	2	2019-11-04	I ordered a taco from here, the Monterrey Steak. So tiny, it fits in the palm of your hand. Taste was ok but I don't think it is worth $6-7.
La Marquesita	5	2019-02-18	Hi, i went to eat lunch here today with my friends and i had a wonderful experience. The space is so clean and beautiful. The food is the best mexican food in toronto. So much variety in their menu. They also have their signature desert. The price is very good too.i am coning back only here for mexican food. The staff is so friendly and fast
La Marquesita	5	2019-05-24	I decided to grab some lunch here and I was not disappointed! I ordered the Mazatlán Fish Tacos and wow! The batter on the fish was not heavy. It had chipotle mayo and guacamole. They gave me a choice of 3 salsas and I chose the Chile de árbol salsa which was medium heat. It was some of the best food I had my whole trip. I highly recommend this place!
La Marquesita	5	2019-05-03	I got a marquesita with cheese and Nutella and it was delicious! I have never tried this before. It had cheese and Nutella and then more Nutella all over the outside. I would also like to try the strawberry and cheese. We also tried their tacos which are great and cheaper than the competition in Kensington. I will definitely be back! It seemed busy and popular, and the guys making the food were friendly.
La Marquesita	5	2019-10-02	My favorite Mexican spot in the city.  My favs are the gorditas, steak tacos, and Mexican fries with steak.
Mariachi’s Restaurant	5	2020-05-08	"been there a couple times just before the lockdown 
staff great 
food fresh and hot .....lots of fun and it doesn't break the bank!!"
Mariachi’s Restaurant	5	2020-01-26	"Amazing and friendly service! The food is good value and very filling. I ordered the veggie fajitas. Definitely add the habanero sauce to give it more spice. The guacamole and tortilla chips are made fresh. My friend really enjoyed his East LA dish and my partner loved the Morelia dish.i also had the sangria which barely tastes like alcohol, but hit me after half the drink. 

I also bought the habanero sauce to take home."
Mariachi’s Restaurant	3	2019-12-23	"Amazing food and drinks. The place is more casual and I loved the decoration. We went at autumn so we could still stay at the patio.

The only thing is that my food was supposed to go in the oven, so my husband dish came first. He finished his meal and then I finally got mine. We complained nicely to the server, but I don't think it made difference. 
I also had a frozen Margherita (which I liked very much) But overall, it's a nice place."
Mariachi’s Restaurant	3	2019-06-06	"So this is my first trip to Canada and I decided to try this place because of a picture I saw of a margarita. So of course,  I did go and order that drink. I asked for a frozen margarita but it was far from frozen. It looked like the machine had melted. They made me another and it looked great but it wasn't sweet. 

I did order the quesadilla with chorizo. It was delicious. They served it Spanish rice and a side salad. First time I've been to a Mexican restaurant and I didn't get black beans. I had the habanero sauce with it and it was super spicy but I live for spicy food!"
Mariachi’s Restaurant	5	2020-02-22	Amazing vibe and great food. Friendly staff.. love the menu and place! Awesome drinks and appetizers
Mariachi’s Restaurant	3	2018-07-24	"It was fun get together at Mariachis last week when me and my friends decided to go here. 
We primarily wanted to try the spicy margaritas. We got the jalepeno cucumber pitcher and the spicy pineapple one. Both were delicious. They got us the frozen style margaritas and I am not sure if they have the on the rocks option. 

During summer they have seating outside which is a small space with quite a few tables in the area. A decent place to sit, however it can get crowded. The place is located on the main road so it's easily accessed. 

We ordered food chicken fajita and our friends got the enchiladas. The fajita were a bit too saucy and wasn't really crisp. We also got some guacamole and that was delicious. So foodwise it was so-so but for drinks it was a really fun place to be!"
Mariachi’s Restaurant	5	2019-05-23	Love this place! I come here almost every week after work for food and drinks. Great cocktails, and great selection of food!
Mariachi’s Restaurant	2	2018-10-13	"Went there on a Sat night at 6pm for dinner before a movie.  
On the plus side the service was reasonably good.  
On the minus side:
1. The prices were much higher than the menu on their website.  This was misleading.
2. The food was small in both flavour and quantity.  

There are far better Mexican restaurants in the area."
Mariachi’s Restaurant	4	2017-11-27	Authentic Mexican place on Eglinton. Nice staff, good quality food, reasonable price and very friendly staff.
Mariachi’s Restaurant	3	2017-12-21	"The food was good and the presentation was awesome but I expected it to be more flavourful. 

The place is clearly family run and the service was great because of that. The lady who served me was super sweet."
Mariachi’s Restaurant	2	2018-06-29	"If you want to go for excellent customer service, go for it. Great people, great location. 

However, if you are going for the food. Skip this place and try something else. Food was mediocre, tasteless and expensive. I'm sorry but I wish I could go back in time and save myself $66."
Mariachi’s Restaurant	1	2017-05-12	"Almost gave it two stars (read to find out more) but the one thing I can't get over is serving an alcoholic drink to someone who specified ""virgin"", when you delivered it to the table she checked again that it was ""virgin"", you agree verbally it had no alcohol, she tries some, tastes alcohol and then you go -- ""Oooh actually this one is the virgin"".  Sure, if she was pregnant or on medication or driving, maybe the sip of alcohol wouldn't be *that* big a deal.  But if she was recovering alcoholic, that one sip could literally change her life, and it's up to you as a business to be honest and knowledgeable about what you're serving.

Things that were terrible:
- we had a reservation, they called us to confirm it was for 700 pm, show up, they say oops we thought 730 pm, they literally have to move people from their seats to accommodate us
- during the 45 minute wait for all this to take place, they took drink orders from us multiple times, but never served us drinks
- they dropped an entire plate of steaming hot chicken fajitas on the ground, it splashed boiling sauce all over people, and their clothes as well
- when i went over to the owner at this point to say - now that we are covered in fajita sauce - can we please have the drinks we keep trying to order? she made a HUGE stink about it, just immediately responded, ""We didn't do any of this on purpose, do you understand? We are doing our best"" and then going to every member of my party reiterating that, as though I had done some rude injustice to her, it was super embarrassing and unprofessional
- drinks still took an extra hour and they weren't good
- they served the birthday girl fajitas with no tortillas or sides, just the meat (she didn't ask for that modification)
- the food was so awful my poor fiance actually sent his BACK -- and this is a guy who complains about NOTHING
- bills took over an hour after asking MULTIPLE times
- the place was so warm they had to keep opening the front door to let in cool air

It almost got 2 stars because they did pay the dry cleaning bill for the jacket that was covered in fajitas sauce, but honestly, I can't forgive the alcohol incident.  This whole experience was stressful and awful. I have no idea why they took our reservation (none of us had been there before), we were clearly too big a group for them at 700 (or 730..or 800...depends who you ask) on a Saturday!"
Mariachi’s Restaurant	5	2017-02-19	"Was at Mariachis on Saturday night for dinner and I left a happy camper! It is a family run establishment; sweetest ladies ever!

Its not fancy and pretentious, very laid back vibe, decor that is typical of mexican restaurants and they have a live band playing. The waitresses laugh and joke with patrons and give great recommendations for food and drinks. Test out your Spanish skills with them, they love it!

We waited a tad long for our food but the staff apologized a few times and checked in so we didn't really notice.

All in all a great experience, I definitely suggest making reservations!"
Mariachi’s Restaurant	5	2018-03-10	"Very nice neighborhood Mexican restaurant.  Staff are very friendly (we were served by a young Mexican girl student) and the food was outstanding. Even my Venezuelan girlfriend was impressed!
We will go back there for sure."
Mariachi’s Restaurant	3	2017-12-09	It's pretty good Mexican food, and the atmosphere is cute. I sometimes come here for lunch when I am at work. Service is friendly and the food is decent. I've ordered the tacos, nachos and the churros. Can't go wrong.
Mariachi’s Restaurant	1	2018-06-14	We went with my children to this restaurant and the service was good but the food was mediocre and heavily priced for the value. I ordered a cheese melt, and got more sausage than cheese and the cheese was cheddar (this dish is not done with cheddar). For $40 dollars per person without alcoholic beverages, one would expect so much more. It was 7 pm and the place was empty. Very disappointed. We won't go back!
Mariachi’s Restaurant	3	2019-02-08	Super expensive for small portions. Good wait staff and very friendly. Better off going to Barburrito not even gonna lie.
Mariachi’s Restaurant	4	2016-02-23	"The food there is amazing, and I'm a fan of this place now :)

The Guacamole and Corn Tortillas are the must to order!!!

Overall, the food is amazing there and I will definitely go back for another round."
Mariachi’s Restaurant	3	2013-10-12	"First things first: Great service! They were so polite, friendly and for the most part fast 

The margaritas were fantastic! I will definitely be back for those! However, the food left my taste buds in complete disappointment!! The appetizer was alright- everything was bland for myself and my boyfriend. 

Entrees: my boyfriend ordered the beef enchiladas. They looked fantastic and I would know, I was looking at his meal for awhile.. I was kept waiting for my chicken enchiladas for about an additional 5-10 minutes after he got his. When it finally came, my rice was cold! Not to mention? I found a hair in it. I pretty much lost my appetite right there. But I was just too hungry in the end- so I ate around my nasty rice. Again, food was bland! For Mexican food, I expect bold flavours and spices... I got none of this. Not to mention, the ""spicy"" sauce was not even a hint of spice in there. 

I gave them three stars because they were über nice and the service was good. However, this is a Mexican place I won't be visiting again for the food."
Mariachi’s Restaurant	4	2018-03-24	The food is pretty good, the margarita is 5 stars. I tried the fajitas, enchiladas, burritos and everything is pretty good but definitely the best part of every visit is a pitcher of margarita
King’s Tacos	4	2020-02-16	"Didn't expect much going into the restaurant but was quite surprised by how roomy it is inside. They can easily host parties with reservations.

We ordered a burrito and one of the make-your-own tacos. Everything was nicely seasoned and they had free chips to start. They also offered 3 types of dips ranging from mild to spicy. Great service with big portions of food. Would come back again"
King’s Tacos	5	2020-01-15	"This year has really started off well for me (at least in terms of food haha)

King Tacos is a family-run Mexican restaurant on St. Clair West. We ordered Gaucamole, Chicken Tacos and Beef Bistec Tacos. 

You do get free fresh chips and sauces with all orders, which I think is super! 

The whole concept is amazing. You get FRESH tacos in a taco box, you assemble it yourself, which I think is nice. You also get 3 different sauces to add to your tacos and you can add cheese too! 

It's very authentic and similar to how it is in Mexico! It's quite a large restaurant with lots of seating. The only thing I would say it as it's family run, it's a little slow. They're definitely hospitable and friendly but the service is a little slow, even for a weekend lunch. I won't ding them for this because the flavours of everything we ordered was scrumptious. Large portions don't hurt either ;)"
King’s Tacos	4	2019-12-09	"Only downside for me, would be better if it was self serve,  order at counter and pick up your food.  Also, no small orders, had to get minimum FOUR tacos. $16.99
Chicken was very good, excellent sauce varieties"
King’s Tacos	4	2019-05-21	"Tacos! Love tacos and loved the flavour of the fillings for the tacos here. 

The only thing I wish they did is being able to mix the tacos choices so you could try more of them without going overboard with the meal sizes. Also feel like because of this the prices are a little more than some other taco spots. 

However overall the tacos are great! Had an enjoyable experience. Side note: the churros are massive."
King’s Tacos	5	2019-08-03	Portion sizes are huge. We've shared one taco dish between two people. Service is always friendly. Free fresh chips and dipping sauces. Very authentic and delicious!
King’s Tacos	4	2019-06-23	Kings Tacos is a family run restaurant, not a chain as I had originally assumed. The meals are really tasty and come in generous quantities. It's also a great for families with little kids.
King’s Tacos	4	2019-09-26	"This family friendly mexican resturant is great.
We opted for the share option, you get a plate of the meat option you choose and some corn tortillas and make your own tacos. 

Everything tasted great. Service was awesome

Only negative was the dessert. We ordered it to go actually and it was hard as though it's been microwaved to long. Also tasted off definitely not what I'm used to and I've had authentic churros plenty of time.

I'll definitely be back just no churros lol"
King’s Tacos	3	2018-08-26	"I was on the street car when I noticed King's Tacos. I was curious so I went in for a bite. I was expecting a fast food restaurant like Taco Bells, but it was a sit down restaurant. King's Tacos decor was plainly decorated in a casual restaurant style. The service was okay, but you have to pay at the front.

The service started with the waitress bringing little bowls of sauce and onions. I am not familiar with Mexican food or tacos. I ordered the Arrachera taco which is made of beef fillets. I added the ingredients and sauces to the tacos to add flavours. I thought that the tacos were okay.

Would I go back? Maybe to try the other tacos. But I am not familiar with Mexican cuisine so it is hard to evaluate the food."
King’s Tacos	4	2019-10-12	Nice place. Well prepared food. Fresh. Very tasty. Good portions. Good customer service.
King’s Tacos	4	2019-08-10	I don't have the pictures to follow but the restaurant was really good and the waiter and the owner was very very nice I would definitely recommend this
King’s Tacos	3	2019-05-18	The food quality and quantity is good. They are making the fresh food for the right price. One thing they need to improve is the cleanliness of the plates and cutlery. Nice spot for Mexican food.
King’s Tacos	4	2020-02-13	Great food, a tad overpriced, but always hits the right spots every single time!!  plenty of vegetarian options, and their mild, medium and hot salsa bowls are to die for!!!
King’s Tacos	4	2019-10-24	I really like this place. It is bright and clean. The food is good and the service is great. There are two shortfalls; no fish tacos, no liquor license. I always get refritos, guacamole, and tacos al pastor. Al pastor is always missing the Pineapple but is good nonetheless. This place needs to serve beer, una cerveza por favor!
King’s Tacos	3	2019-08-16	Had to check this place out after my friends raved about its authenticity. Staff and servers are warm and welcoming. We ordered take out and didn't have to wait too long. I had the chicken tacos which I found to be dry. May have to try the beef ones next time.
King’s Tacos	5	2019-08-22	Delicious food and some of the friendliest restraunt owners I've ever met. Authentic Mexican (as far as I know) but thats what they say and it's so good I just believe em. Not very expensive but very high quality. Fully recommend for anyone who wants tacos or burritos.
King’s Tacos	4	2018-11-15	"Cheap, simple, tasty and huge portions.

They greet you with a (free!) basket of homemade deep-fried tortilla chips and 3 house made sauces: smoky, hot and very hot - all excellent. 

Their guacamole is on point and service is quick. 

We typically order 2-3 different meat platters that come with warm tortillas, diced onions/cilantro and limes to share and essentially make your own tacos. Order lettuce and diced tomato on the side, if you wish. Definitely order a side of grilled jalepenos!"
King’s Tacos	4	2018-02-01	"After hearing rave reviews about this place from my brother, who loves food more than I do, we finally had a chance to feast on the delicious tacos from here. For 6 people we ordered a large guacamole, refried beans and 3 orders of the special build your own tacos (king's special, chorizo and beef with onion). 

When you arrive, they bring you unlimited nachos and their three sauces, mild, medium and spicy. The mild was my favourite! I can't really describe it but it has a nice smokey flavour and orange in colour. The medium is a green hot sauce which was equally delicious with a nice kick. The spicy was my least favourite. It was kind of spicy, but flavourless. 

The guacamole was delicious. It was perfectly mashed and not too chunky or too creamy. 

The refried beans were yummy, but really heavy so I didn't have too much of it. 

My favourite of the three meats we tried was the kings special. I loved the mix of all the flavours of beef, chorizo and bacon mixed with onions. Yummmm! The beef with onion and the chorizo were good, but for some reason, saltier than the kings special. Also, all these plates are extremely greasy, so keep that in mind because you won't be able to stop yourself from stuffing your face until you can't breath. It's just that delicious. The only downfall was that I felt really crappy for the next few days. The food here is really heavy and oily and it will be coming out of your pores. 

The service here is great! They're quick and friendly. This has been one of my favourite taco experiences in Toronto thus far!"
King’s Tacos	5	2019-07-29	The best. Staff are usually friendly and I don't have to wait too long for my food, definitely my go-to taco place
King’s Tacos	5	2018-04-07	Came here for the first time and will definitely come back!! We tried this place on a whim because our regular taco place was closed.  Had found this on yelp and it had pretty good reviews so we decided to give it a try.  As you can see by the pictures is looked great, but not only does it look great it tastes great.  I have never been to a Mexican restaurant like this, basically you make your own tacos. And by the portion size they give you, you can make about 5 tacos. The staff was friendly and nice as well.  I would very much definitely come again.  I just wish I didn't have to pay for street parking.
King’s Tacos	2	2017-10-07	"A disappointment for vegetarians. I'd read about King's tacos on Yelp and on some Facebook discussions and expected to be pleasantly surprised by their home-style serving style and innovative veggie options. Sadly that did not happen. 

We ordered the veggie tacos and were excited to try the welcome chips and salsas. Turns out at least one of the salsas has chicken stock - why!? - and the rest were just watery meh. 

The veggie tacos were fine at best. Pretty oily and just boring. And, finding a meat piece in the veggie mix was the final straw. Definitely won't be back and still in search of a decent veggie taco in Toronto. Tips welcome!"
Los Guaca-Moles	4	2019-02-16	"Located in a side street of Koreatown, this place is a little hidden gem. Though the entrance before you walk in is large and they have signs indicating it's a restaurant, you would have never thought there would be a restaurant hidden within a side residential street. 

We came on a Friday night around 6:30 and we were the only people there. It slowly started to get busy after. The food is great and not very pricey at all. It is authentic Mexican food. We ordered a corn appetizer and it was really good. The tacos were good and my grapefruit margarita on the rocks just hit the right spot. Definitely worth trying out this place and I'll definitely come back when I'm craving for tacos."
Los Guaca-Moles	3	2019-07-07	"The service was great and the ambiance was nice too. I most definitely will come back for drinks.

However, the food was too pricey and the portions too small - it wasn't worth it.
My boyfriend got the Alambre vegetariano for $18, which consisted of 3 tiny tacos filled with a bit of veggies and a small rice tower next to it. For that price he was expecting a nice and filling meal, not a sad appetizer sized meal."
Los Guaca-Moles	5	2018-09-21	"Super-nice back patio and friendly service. Artfully made food. My wife and I stumbled by accidentally. We'd already had dinner earlier that night, but the restaurant's pleasant exterior beckoned. 

Before we knew it we were seated on the back patio. 

We each ordered a couple of tacos and they were nicely done. I really enjoyed my Hongos taco. Perfectly rolled and dressed; crispy and well presented on a thin rectangular plate. 

We were going to leave it at that, but the desert really grabbed us. 

So- 10 years ago I fell in love with avocado gelato. It's really good but I've only seen it made at one gelato place that has long been out of business.  Anyhow, my wife was really excited to spot that on the menu, there it was!!! Avocado gelato. Served with churros and sauce.  Yummm.  So good. Highly recommended. 

We'll be back for a proper dinner for sure.  

Check out the back patio while it's still warmish out. (As I write this, it's almost officially Fall). Cheers!"
Los Guaca-Moles	4	2018-04-29	"My boyfriend and I came here on Friday and had a really positive experience. We stopped in after an event and were looking for a yummy meal.

When you first walk in, you'll notice a Mexican flag covering the door and a long narrow area for guests to sit. Our waiter came over and seated us at a table. The restaurant was dimly lit and it created the perfect environment for a date night. 

We asked our waiter which tacos he would recommend with my two food allergies (I'm both gluten and lactose intolerant) and he recommended we try La Tinga and El Nopal. We also ordered two Lime Margaritas. 

La Tinga Taco
La Tinga is a chicken taco served on a soft corn tortilla. We both found this taco a little bland. The chicken didn't have much flavour; we couldn't really taste the chipotle sauce, the red sauce or the flavour of the onions. (If you visit this restaurant I do not recommend you try this dish). 

El Nopal Taco
I was surprised the waiter suggested we try El Nopal taco. It is a vegetarian taco and I didn't expect it to be as good as La Tinga. To our surprise, El Nopal pushed La Tinga out of the water. El Nopal was absolutely fantastic! It is made with a corn tortilla, cactus strips marinated in a green tomatillo sauce, coriander and crispy tortilla bits.

This was my first time trying a cactus dish and I absolutely loved it! The tacos had a lot of flavour and the cactus flesh was the texture of a root vegetable. I honestly don't know how to explain the flavours of this dish but it is definitely something you need to try!

Lime Margaritas:
We ordered two lime Margaritas and really enjoyed them. I was surprised they arrived on the rocks instead of as a slushy (I missed that memo in the menu) but it was prepared really well. The drinks has the perfect tart flavour and they were quite refreshing.

Would I Return to this restaurant???
Absolutely!!  I'd love to try some of their other tacos and I love how they can accommodate different food intolerances."
Los Guaca-Moles	5	2019-10-26	Best Mexican food I have had in Canada!! Everything was excellent!! Enchiladas were my favourite, but tacos and ceviche were delicious as well. Drinks were great too and the service super friendly and fast. I look forward to go back soon!! I recommend this place 100%
Los Guaca-Moles	5	2018-12-02	"HOLY LOS GUACA-MOLES!!

Los Guacamoles is the BEST Mexican food in Toronto by far! I travel to Mexico regularly and the food at Los Guacamoles matches that of when you travel off the beaten path in Mexico and end up eating the amazing real flavours of one of the most amazing food cultures!

It's a really cute well decorated place too! 

The molè is unbelievable, the dobladas are to die for... but the funnest thing on the menu is the Queso Fundito with Chorizo!  I could eat 20 of those in one seating. I'm getting the shakes just thinking of it...  I think I can't get enough of this place!!

Definitely check it out!!"
Los Guaca-Moles	1	2019-06-21	I rarely ever review restaurants but this was extraordinarily mediocre. Fish stunk, guacamole was too hot (no flavour, just heat) and the service was slow. Don't bother
Los Guaca-Moles	5	2018-03-19	"We came here on a whim, and we were not disappointed. We ordered 3 tacos for two of us and enchiladas for the third. 

For dessert we ordered the avocado helato in addition to the Dulce de Leche Helado. Both are amazing! It's a must get! 

For drinks, we got a mojito, sangria and a Caesar (for myself). The ceasar was done really well! In the end they gave us a free round of a Mexican shot, which was super nice of them!"
Los Guaca-Moles	5	2019-01-02	"Amazing authentic Mexican food, and a friendly environment. Ask for the the really hot sauce ;)
Truly love all the food here, Queso Fundido, Elote, and Dobladas, or Chorizo tacos."
Los Guaca-Moles	4	2019-03-09	Definitely a hidden gem in Toronto's Koreatown but worth it for a late night dinner. The drinks were great, food was great (especially that homemade sauce they serve!!) I had the sangria and the Barbacoa tacos and the queso fundido and it was all soooo good. Only problem was that it felt like the service was slow, my table would visibly be ready to order or leave and it felt like our time there was definitely drawn out
Los Guaca-Moles	1	2019-06-01	"II really, really wanted to just love this place and sorry about the loooong review (i am normally not one to have such an extended view) BUT I made two mistakes today:

1) Cancelling my reservation at Playa Cabana ( the last 5:00 pm spot) to go to this restaurant (SMH)
2) The place is supposed to open at 5,like a dumbass I actually waited until 5:20 when they finally decided they felt like opening.

That kind of slackness will get your business shut down in Toronto, with sooooooooooo many good places to go and eat all within blocks who the hell is really gonna stick around and wait for places to open past the time they should be??? ....ohhhhhhhhh the regret folks.   

When I walked in ,there were only two other people seated ( who also decided to sit outside and wait saw them earlier)..hmm wonder if they too had regret, but anyways onto the experience. Walked in and there was a bartender and 1 person sitting at the bar. So we seat ourselves at the front of the restaurant and it literally took the guy behind the bar 10 min. to finally put down some menus, he goes back to the bar chitty chatty with the guy sitting at the bar another 10 min goes by he  comes back to take the order. We order drinks and food (Sabinita-- layers of refried black beans, cheese, sour cream & guacamole, Poblanito -soft tortilla; mole poblano sauce w/shredded chicken breast; garnished w/sesame seeds) and two Pescado- mole poblano sauce w/shredded chicken breast; garnished w/sesame seeds). 

Slowly two of the wait staff make their way in and the guy behind the bar says something in spanish possibly about being late who knows seems to be the trend here, and then another table of patrons come in and than another the wait staff all of two seem confused and dazed. The Sabinita comes to to the table and I ask the waiter if our drinks are coming he says he doesn't know, 5 min later the rest of the order comes out I ask again about the drinks another guy comes over with a menu I said no I ordered them when I first sat down? Repeated the order ( like really the bartender couldn't remember to send out the friggin drinks when at the time there was a total of 4ppl in the place (I could just imagine if there were more than 12 ppl in this place it would be like chaos to remember OMG all these drinks OMG ....seriously its like amateure night in here).

 He comes back minutes later with the drinks, in all fairness not his fault he didn't take the order initially nor was he the  DUH guy that said didn't know when the drinks were coming, and that is the last time we saw anyone come over,no one came by to check on the table to see if everything was good ( which it was NOT) and the place was not busy 4 tables occupied does not constitute as busy.   

 The Poblanito was just ok , the fish tacos were downright dreadful they were breaded in some sort of cornmeal which  was not an issue but the fish they used had a gelatinous texture and honestly there wasn't a dash of seasoning in the coating or the fish itself  not even the toppings were seasoned. IT WAS BLAND  i could barely get through it so so i doused it with hot sauce and still it stank (tastewise) so I only ate the one left the other one on the plate and covered it with my napkin (RIP).

 So now all I have left is half a beer which i'm chugging so I can get the hell outta there!! I indicate to the waiter that we're ready to leave and the bill arrives and he asked how was it ?  I was blunt, honest said it was terrible he was concerned surprised and wanted specifics, so I went off about the fish he said he would go and let the the guy in the back know ,  I said really you don't have to but off he went came back apologised. I said I guess that is just how its done here the only redeeming thing about this whole meal was the Sabinita & the beer.

 Sad to say but  I'm not one to give 2nd chances when it comes to food & service like I said this city is a ""Food Mecca"" too many other places to go and try, so bottom line I would never venture back to this place, I would rather take my $$ and go around the corner to Barrio Coreano or Tacos El Asador where the service and food at least in my experiences have been consistently great ."
Los Guaca-Moles	5	2018-06-03	I love this place! I try to come in for a visit every time I'm in the city! The service is quick, the food is amazing.
Los Guaca-Moles	3	2018-06-06	It was a good restaurant, the enchiladas were good. The ice cream and dessert were better. Decent prices and service was fast. Nothing stood out to make it great.
Los Guaca-Moles	3	2019-05-11	"Not impressed. I really wanted to like this place. From the reviews it seemed like this was a hidden gem type of place bit all I found there was mediocre overpriced food and indifferent service.
Had the queso fundido which was decent but not great, not hot enough so the cheese was already hardening up, chorizo was bland, also a small portion with only four tortillas for twelve dollars.
The elotes were ok, nothing special. One cob cut in thirds.
The tacos though were really disappointing. Had a fish, a calamari, and a cactus. Three for fifteen dollars was the deal. The fish and calamari were tiny nuggets of tasteless breaded frozen seafood, the nopales tasted like they were straight out of a can. They were all bizarrely garnished with two cucumber half-moons, the fish was garnished with the usual cabbage slaw. 
The two salsas provided were the best part of the meal.
The service was inattentive at best, water was never refilled, waiters were wandering around aimlessly with salsas and dishes, not knowing where they were going. Never were asked how the food was or if we needed anything.
Not a negative experience per se but not one that I care to experience again."
Los Guaca-Moles	1	2018-05-31	"Ordered through Uber eats .. maybe going to restaurant better , not sure , but the food was really gross. Waste of 70 bucks .. threw most of it out and feel really gross and might vomit .. nasty 
0 stars"
Los Guaca-Moles	1	2018-09-23	If you want to pay for a virgin margarita for a regular priced margarita, by all means come to this place!
Los Guaca-Moles	5	2017-05-14	"Went to Los Guaca-Moles for Mother's Day lunch today and it was fabulous! The service was second to none and then the food came in.  It was everything I hope for - a bit of crunch, a smidge of heat, and a healthy dose of citrus.I wanted a little more heat, and they came through with their home-made hot sauces. A touch of smoke made these quite delicious!  I expected at least a hint of cilantro, but that was not to be. No worries! It was a delightful meal and didn't cost a great deal. 
The restaurant is a little off the beaten track, which would account for the low patronage. But if you're looking for a scrumptious dinner in lovely ambiance, go to Los Guaca-Moles!"
Los Guaca-Moles	5	2016-06-16	"Brand New Mexican restaurant in Toronto! Feasted on tacos and chips and guacamole. Decent prices for Toronto. The restaurant just opened and the staff are super friendly. Pitchers of sangria $29 and a back patio will make this a great addition to the area. Food is fresh, tasty, flavours are well balanced and delicious 
Tacos are 3 for $12. Appetizers and burritos as well. Great drinks selection"
Los Guaca-Moles	5	2017-12-03	"Los Guaca-moles is heating up the hood. Start out with the elote (mexican corn - sweet, succulent and bathed in cheeses and spices that  are always a well kept secret.).
Chicken chalupas are my personal favourite - hand crafted corn tortillas smothered in chicken, beans and salsa. Expect a mess. Use your hands here. 
Home made ice creams- avocado and caramel...just as you think you are sugared out pop a churro in your mouth. No words. Good for families or date night. Tequilla, mojitos, sangria and margaritas as well as wines by the glass."
Los Guaca-Moles	3	2017-04-29	"3.5. Actually. We were attempting to visit the Seven Lives Pop Up on Bloor, but the door was locked on Friday night at 7pm. We had seen the sandwich board for Los Guaca Moles on the street and decided that fate wanted us to visit this place instead. 

They were insanely busy during the dinner rush and we sat at the bar for a while waiting while the two staff who were running the bar and the floor got caught up. I have no problem with slow service as long as they keep the drinks coming. They were also apologetic and thanked us for our patience. 

We ordered the Guacamole with crickets which was a decent size and there was nothing wrong with the chips despite what other reviewers have said. The bartender brought us some nice habernero sauce that had a wonderful spice that sneaks up on you. The Pulpo Tostadas were bit too sweet for me. The octopus was tender, but the sauce ruined the flavour a bit for me. I aded more habernero sauce and they were better.

Tacos were loaded with fillings. The fish was dusted in cornmeal and cooked to soft perfection. Chorizo was interesting and quite good, but I""ll confess I only ordered it because they didn't have the liver taco available. The Lengua (tongue) taco was my favourite and reminded me of Mexico. 

There were also a few items going out that looked really delicious and unique to the restaurant. I'd love to go back and try out. 

Overall, I think Los Guaca Moles may be going through a few growing pains, but this leaves more room for them to grow! I'd go back and give them another go. The atmosphere was fun and intimate without being too crowded and I'd love to check out their cozy patio on a warmer night."
Gusto 101	5	2020-03-31	"This seemingly small place serves some delicious food. It looks small from the outside but is actually quite spacious on the inside. We went in early February, and were seated right away. 

I ordered the ground sausage & roasted red pepper pizza, and my best friend ordered the lamb meatballs. We also got an appetizer of the fresh bread (not complimentary). Everything was incredibly delicious. The service was great everyone was so polite. The pizza crust was the perfect texture of just a tiny crispy on the outside, while soft and fluffy on the inside. The lamb meatballs' flavour was very rich (and not too rich), and their sauce was to die for. 

We left feeling extremely full, with tummies satisfied. I will definitely return to this restaurant in the future."
Gusto 101	4	2020-02-16	"Came here on Valentine's Day, despite not having reservations we were accommodated.

The vibe was nice and food was amazing (except the dessert)! We ordered a margarita pizza and mushroom pasta which were both phenomenal! Food did get cold super fast, but I blame the ice box weather.

The pana cotta was a huge let down. The flavors did not mesh well what so ever. Totally avoid at all costs. 

My only feedback is to step up their service. When the server brought out our food, I asked for parmesan cheese and crushed peppers. She said there is already ""a lot"" of parmesan cheese on there, walked away and came back with only crushed pepper?? Lol last I checked I was the one eating the food and didn't ask if she thought I needed parmesan cheese. 

Additionally our actual waiter was slow and did not check on us at all."
Gusto 101	5	2020-02-02	"I was looking for some great Italian places to try out in Toronto and this place caught my attention. The reservation is recommended here. We missed our reservation. So, we had to sit in patio area on the roof near the bar. The other option was to wait for 45 mins. The place has a dim lit kind of ambience. The staff is very well trained and is very friendly.

Now, coming to food, we started with Tuscan fries and Mushroom Bruschetta. Fries were crispy and then Bruschetta just tasted amazing. In Mains, we tried their famous Truffle Mushroom Pasta and Melanzane Pizza. Both dishes just tasted heavenly. The base of Pizza was very thin and full of cheese. The Pasta was creamy and so yummy. We ended our meal with their Chocolate Cake and Tiramisu. Both of them were really good, especially the Tiramisu one. Overall, a great place to try some amazing Italian food. But it is a little costly. So, it might burn your pockets a little bit."
Gusto 101	3	2020-01-18	"Coming here for the 3rd time because I was craving pizza. We got a seat right away around 7pm on Friday on the lower floor. Nice candlelit tables, dim, however very loud and we had to shout across the table to hear each other.

Went with the basic margarita pizza and fries. Despite my food coming fast, my pizza was cold :( Probably waited on the counter too long because my bf's pizza was warm. Thin and crunchy, I had a salt craving that day lol.

The fries tasted like layz fries (oily and crunchy) but airier. Comes with light garlic sauce.

Decided to try a panna cotta for dessert (blood orange for 10.99) I'm sad to say this is one of the worst desserts i've tasted, just wasn't my cup of tea. I thought it would be a custard consistency considering it's heavy cream based, but it came in a cup instead. And it wasn't creamy nor sweet- it was really sour! The orange froth on top was okay but then you get to orange chunks in the middle that's really tangy, and at the bottom you have olive oil?? My taste buds did not like the combination of olive oil and orange. Sorry, but i couldn't finished it :/"
Gusto 101	5	2019-12-23	"After hearing great things about Gusto 101 I finally had my turn to try it and I was not disappointed, AT ALL!

I really liked the rustic interior and the restaurant gave a more upscale casual vibe. I felt welcome in just my jeans and sweater. The staff was super friendly and assisted us happily. We had brought a birthday cake to celebrate our friends birthday and they gladly put it in their fridge, and even cut and served it to us after we sang happy birthday. It was returned in perfect condition (except for those slices we ate of course).

On top of the service and decor, the food was absolutely bomb! Our table of 4 shared the Cavalo Caesar Salad (kale caesar), Polipo (grilled octopus), and Mushroom Brushcetta to start. The Cavalo caesar was tasty and every ingredient complimented eachother. I wasn't too heavy and tasted heavenly. The grilled octopus was tender and delicious. The mushroom bruchetta was also delicious and had lots of mushrooms on top.

For our mains we had the Calamarata (Spicy seafood pasta), Taliatelle (Bolognese ragu pasta) and the Mafalde Al Funghi (Mushroom Truffle Cream Sauce). Can I just say, my personal dish, the Mafalde Al Funghi, was THE BEST mushroom cream pasta I've had thus far, and it's not because I was just hungry. If you love cream pasta, and mushrooms you must try this. Combined with the truffle oil, it just brought my pasta experience to another level. The pasta itself was cooked al dente and complimented this rich sauce so well. I had a sample of the other 2 pastas which were very very good in their own right, but the mushroom pasta was the best in my opinion. If you're lactose intolerant, be wary though.

I'm glad I finally got to try Gusto 101 and am looking forward to my next visit hopefully very very soon."
Gusto 101	5	2020-01-03	"I love this restaurant. Ate out on the patio during the summer and the atmosphere was great, food phenomenal, service was good too. I ordered the kale salad (""Cavolo Nero"" on menu) as the appetizer, which I underestimated at first but was clearly mistaken once I tried it. SO GOOD! The kale salad is a must try. For the main meal I ordered the truffle mushroom pasta (""Mafalde Al Funghi"" on menu) ughhhh so good. Also ordered a Margherita pizza and that was also very delicious but I'd suggest going for something different while you're here! There are a lot of options on the menu including an array of different drinks.!

Would I recommend? Heck yesss"
Gusto 101	4	2019-11-10	"This is a fantastic establishment with embodies delicious Italian cuisine and a culture that resembles Italy. It has a really vibrant, open roof top and a nice, buzzing, dim indoor space. Both areas are loud and roudy and give a great environment to hang, grab food and grab a drink with friends.

I got the infamous Mafalde Al Funghi which is basically their mushroom, truffle pasta! The shape of Mafalde is perfect for picking up the super delicious truffle cream sauce and making each bite so good as you soak in that savoury, creamy sauce. They could've definitely plated the food better and I was originally skeptical when it arrived. But when I had it I was surprised how simple and elegant the dish was, yet it was so tasty. I wish the portions were bigger though for the $22 I had to pay!

They have their own house wine on tap for $1 per ounce! So it was $5 for a glass of wine, which is ridiculously cheap and it tasted pretty reasonable as well! (Another thing that resembles Italy! Cheap wine while you eat your meal!)

All in all, I enjoy this restaurant and I'll definitely come back again!"
Gusto 101	4	2019-09-20	"No wonder this place is so busy almost everyday,every hour, every season. Good service, good food & reasonable pricing ( for downtown core location).

The bad? The wait time. But I hit the jackpot tonight, without much wait time. 

Too loud for a decent conversation. If you want a full on conversation and not wanting to scream on top of your lungs,t with your louder than usual voice. Then this is not the place for you."
Gusto 101	5	2019-09-15	"Go for the Gusto! Superb service, great ambiance and fantastic food. 
Planned a small surprise birthday dinner for my sister. She listed this as one of her favourite eateries in the city so I arrived early with balloons. 
The front entrance staff were very kind to allow me to get a table for four ...with balloons LOL. 
Wait staff were equally friendly and very fast. Service was excellent. 
Food: my sister highly enjoys their kale salad. I thought it was great - massaged kale shredded with some sort of lemon vinaigrette and topped with Parmesan shavings. 
I spied the pizzas making their way to the tables of others so I went with a  prosciutto and arugula option. It was delicious. Perfect combination of flavours with a light, crispy crust. 

Definitely recommend for a nice, light meal with friends. A little loud for a date night but groups seem to like it (there's a second level and a patio during the summer months)."
Gusto 101	5	2019-08-07	"I swear Toronto has the best rooftop patios/bars and this restaurant is one of them. Gusto is a a beautiful restaurant located in downtown Toronto. My friend and I went here on a Sunday afternoon for brunch. There wasn't even a queue to get in, which was a pleasant surprise.

 The restaurant's dinning area is split into two levels. We sat upstairs in their gorgeous rooftop area, it kind of reminded me of a greenhouse. The service here was great as well. Our waiter was polite and very attentive. 

I ordered a mimosas ($11 I think) and the eggs in purgatorio which came with a side of grilled sourdough bread with a spicy tomato like sauce on top. The meal was delicious! The flavor was perfect! The eggs do come runny which I normally don't like but went really well with this meal. I'd definitely recommend trying this place out! There dinner menu looks just as yummy especially if you're in the mood for Italian."
Gusto 101	5	2020-01-20	My boyfriend planned a birthday dinner for 17 friends this past Friday and we were all very happy with our meal. We were in a private wine cellar on the bottom floor and shared family style plates for each course. Family style set ups normally leave me a teeny bit hungry afterwards but not this time at all. As per usual, the highlight was the truffle pasta, which had us all thinking about it the next couple of days. The minimum spend was very reasonable and we would all definitely do it all again. Big shout out to our waitress - you were amazing!
Gusto 101	4	2020-01-20	"Great food with great atmosphere. The lighting is very dim so good for dates! I went with a group of four girls for a friend's birthday and we were seated on the top level.  It was very cold at first due to all the windows but they turned up the heat eventually.  One party of four kept their coats on the whole time since they were seated next to the window.

Staff was friendly and attentive.  The food was great. Mushroom pasta had a great truffle flavour but by the end it was quite heavy. Still finished it though! The grilled octopus was tasty and the kale salad was flavourful with lots of cheese. The chocolate dessert was very dense and rich but good to share with another person.

Would come back and maybe try their burger next time!"
Gusto 101	4	2019-09-08	"Excellent service and food despite breaking my heart. 

Went in yesterday for lunch after watching a TIFF film with the girls (make sure you check out Just Mercy with Michael B Jordan!) and got a nice seat on the upper patio despite the restaurant being quite busy. 

We ended up having the burger, avocado toast and the uova in camicia. All were excellent. Although the avocado toast portion was small, it was absolutely delicious. Keep in mind there is a very spicy drizzle that comes on the dish so if you don't like spicy make sure your server knows. I , however was licking my fingers! You may need two orders for a group of 4 because only 3 smallish slices of bread. 

Now for the sad part....
This was my first visit and I've had it bookmarked forever and was really there to try the pizza and pastas. Of course we get there and the pizza oven was down and they don't serve pastas (except 1 special) on their brunch menu. Yikes! I tried ordering the Eggs in Purgatorio but was told that also was made in the oven (double yikes!!) 

The server was exceptionally kind and was very apologetic. She made good with a complimentary tiramisu which was tasty enough for me to return for that alone. 

Overall, great trendy spot with fantastic service and food. I didn't succeed with the pizza and pastas the first time but I'll brush it off and hopefully be back to try again!"
Gusto 101	4	2019-09-04	"Probably my favourite Italian place in Toronto - definitely coming back for great food and drinks. Would recommend Gusto for date night or drinks and dinner with the girls. 

We came in around 7:30PM Saturday night and were seated relatively quickly. I ordered the Mushroom and Truffle pasta, boyfriend got the T Bone steak, and we had the beef tartare as our app. 

Drinks were so so good, I got the dragon fruit and watermelon cocktail and it tasted like juice but I could taste just the subtle flavour of hard liquor. 

Pasta was perfectly aldente and so much mushroom and truffle flavour, it brought me back to the truffle pasta I had in Florence. T Bone was great, flavour was really good and the addition of mushrooms was a nice touch to balance the strong flavour of steak. Beef tartare was surprisingly delicious, there was a truffle infused sauce that you could mix the beef with and place it on the baguette chip and not was that heavenly. 

Come here if you're looking for great Italian food and cozy vibes."
Gusto 101	4	2019-09-04	"Great place for dinner! Casual atmosphere with really great food! 

We sat in the patio area and had a few of their dishes. We had the cacio e pepe, tomahawk steak, margherita pizza, broccolini, and their rucola salad. Everything was really good! The steak was cooked perfectly, nice and tender. The rucola salad was fresh and love the dressing on it. Finished off with tiramisu and panna cotta... both very good. 

The service was really good and they have a nice wine menu. Would love to go back to try some other things on the menu."
Gusto 101	3	2019-08-27	"I ordered a cappuccino with lenticchie while my friend ordered the mushroom bruschetta and panna cotta. I sampled her food as well so I will share my thoughts.

Cappuccino was okay. It was a nice and quick pick me up after work. Lenticchie was average.The lentils were flavoured with crispy salami, pachino tomatoes and zucchini. I couldn't taste the zucchini but the rest was nicely flavoured.

Mushroom bruschetta and panna cotta was Michu better in comparison. Mushroom bruschetta was nice and crunchy. The mushrooms were flavoured nicely and brought out a lot of its natural flavours. The panna cotta has a citrusy taste and a really great summer treat!

Servers were quick to refill waters and to check if we were doing okay. Price point is fairly high for what we ordered but will come back to try the pasta."
Gusto 101	5	2019-06-23	"This restaurant is a go-to of mine that I can always count on. They serve up tried and true dishes that always taste delicious and are filled with flavour! 

Be aware, wait times can be pretty long at this spot. It is not uncommon to be told that you will have to wait 45 mins at the door. I suggest getting here before the dinner buzz comes in (and I promise it's worth it). The atmosphere is lively, the restaurant is industrial chic, and the service is impeccable. 

As most will note, the mafalde ai funghi is a must try. The truffle cream sauce is to die for. You can't go wrong with this signature dish. Another favourite of mine is the prosciutto e rucola. This pizza is the perfect blend of ingredients. And don't forget to share the burrata as a starter! This creamy delectable cheese will make you feel like you are truly in Italy. 

10/10 spot. Will be coming back again soon."
Gusto 101	5	2020-01-07	"A solid spot for Italian - I now see why this place has so much hype around it. We didn't book reservations, but were able to get a bar seat upstairs. The space was super cool, and my family visiting from out of town loved it!

The bread was delicious, the salad and the pastas were amazing, and the dessert was perfect. I have nothing bad to say - overall a 5/5 for me. I will definitely be back!"
Gusto 101	4	2019-06-29	"Fresh fish, quality pasta and an above average cup of espresso make this livley Italian restaraunt the place to be if you are near the core. 

We arrived as a group of six and were quickly seated.  The service was up to standard for the area; quick, consistent and attentive.  As a side note, the gratuity for a group that size is included.

The layout of high ceiling, exposed brick walls and an open-concept kitchen is fun (if not overplayed ).  At 
1:00pm the restaraunt seemed to be packed with young professionals catching up with old friends.  It's lively and a little loud (in a good way).

We shared a number of dishes.  I tried the Mafalde Funghi pasta (mushrooms), a Margarita Pizza, a Branzino (fish and oh so good) and the Cavolo Nero salad. The food ranged from good to excellent.

The salad was remarkably refreshing and had a good balance of flavours.  The pasta was savory and filling and the pizza was above average if not amazing.

The Branzino looked to be grilled with some olive oil and served on a small bed of veggies.  It was nice and simple.

For dessert I had cannoli and a double espresso.   The coffee was rich and had a distinct flavour (befitting of any self-respecting Italian restaurant).  The cannoli could have been better.  The cream cheese filling just doesn't measure up to the rest of the meal. 

Will definately come back to Gusto next time I am in the area or to catch up with an old friend."
Gusto 101	5	2019-05-30	"We arrived on time for our Monday 11:30am reservation - party of 7. At around noon, the restaurant was PACKED (mostly working professionals) - and rightfully so! Food, service, and vibe were all 5 stars in my book.

We went a little overboard with the apps for the table: 
* house-baked foccacia bread bucket x 2 - seriously addicting, but would taste even better if it was complimentary :P
* burrata served with sweet heirloom tomatoes and fragrant olive oil
* mushroom bruschetta (one per person) - MUST-GET!! cheesy, crunchy, and full of umami flavor

For entrees, most of us ordered the signature pasta dish: truffle funghi, which was creamy, indulgent, and perfect for carb-lovers. Portion was generous, so I'd recommend sharing esp. if you plan to go ham on the starters like we did.

Service was friendly, attentive, and accommodating. For example, they were able to serve 7 pieces of bruschetta even when standard order came in 3 pieces. We had a complicated check split request, and they showed no qualms about it. I'm looking forward to carb-loading here again the next time I'm in town."
Ristorante Sotto Sotto	5	2019-12-31	Love the food here!! Best Italian in town. Highly recommended. And the waitress was very sweet and professional. I ordered octopus for appetizer & pasta for main course. Yummmm
Ristorante Sotto Sotto	2	2019-12-29	"Came here on a Sunday evening with 4 people. The seafood risotto was good with lots of seafood. 

The surprising part was that the server/restaurant added automatically added a 20% tip to the bill. He just put in the tip amount himself on the POS terminal and said service charge was added. 

I do not like being forced into tipping at a certain amount and therefore would not visit the restaurant again."
Ristorante Sotto Sotto	5	2019-06-29	"Came here after hearing about this location in Drake song. This location would definitely be considered fine dining and would excellent for a upscale occasion. The walls are filled with celebs that have came to dine here over the years which is different for sure. 

I came here for work and ended up eating at the bar which was a pleasurable experience. The tiger Shrimp were big and nicely seasoned but the asparagus was incredible! Yum!

Next time in Toronto I'll be back to visit and check out more items on the menu!"
Ristorante Sotto Sotto	5	2019-02-06	"What a fantastic place! A hidden gem at that! We had reservations and once we arrived we were immediately seated upstairs in a dim area lit with candles. Our server was lovely and described the specials and menu in detail. I went with the Pappardelle Dei Castelli and Minestrone soup. We were brought some fresh bread and olive oil which was amazing. 

My soup was amazing. Not over done and was tasty. The entree was perfection. You can tell the noodles are homemade and wow that sauce was amazing- I opted for butter cream sauce versus the wine sauce that is typically included. Glad I went this route!! 

We had to try some dessert too so we all split the Gelato Affogato and Devils Chocolate Gelati. Both were satisfying and presented nicely. 

Love this intimate establishment and will definately be back!"
Ristorante Sotto Sotto	1	2018-11-06	"AVOID 
TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE
BETTER OPTIONS ELSEWHERE
-  was served 3 risottos when I asked for one, and was blamed by the staff that I ordered that many
-  risotto was raw as well

I was quite excited to try this place with two friends. The miscommunication ruined the whole experience for me. 

Knowing that the lunch stops at 3pm and that the risotto takes 40 mins to cook. I called in ahead of time to speak to someone around 1:30pm to have my amalfi risotto ready as I was making my way there. I spoke to a server, I informed her that I wanted 1 order of the Seafood risotto for a table of 3 people. I think it was this point where the miscommunication happened. She agreed and said it will be ready for us.

We arrived at 2pm, we spoke to the initial server and I asked him about the risotto, that I called in about. And he's like is it for here or to go? I told him that we were dining in. 

We were seated and waited for 40 mins. Before the risotto came out. To our surprise they brought us THREE RISOTTO dishes. Mind you, on the menu the risotto dish serves 2 people. At no point in time between 2pm to 2:40pm there was any clarification on the order. So I asked the server and informed him that I only wanted 1. So he fetched the server that I spoke to on the phone. And she insisted that I ordered 3 Risottos. I tried to explain to her that party was not ready to eat 6 peoples portion of risotto.

My experience is already ruined at this point. I don't know why she would think that I would want 6 people amounts of risotto. I could've tried other things in the restaurant. 

The risotto itself looked amazing. So if the food was okay I didn't mind.

Unfortunately the risotto was under-cooked. It had a grainy, sandy texture that stuck to the teeth. I informed my guests, and another one agreed with me. I let the server know, he brought Chef Massimo Renzi tableside and he just told me it was cooked al dente, and that he used carnaroli rice. 

So know we're stuck eating extra risotto that was under-cooked. My other friend thought the rice was fine, until he tried the one underneath the top layer. I'm assuming that the chef probably tasted that top layer and thought the other rice cooked as well. 

The seafood in the risotto was perfectly cooked but the dish was spoiled under-cooked rice. 

I think ultimately the experience was ruined when I got 3 Risottos instead of 1. Which caused the quality of control to go down on the rice. 

You will see in the photos that you can see the centre of the rice. Which is an indicator that the rice was raw."
Ristorante Sotto Sotto	2	2018-12-05	"Sotto Sotto has been on my list for a long time and I was happy to be able to dine there recently.

The waiter kept asking us repeatedly if we want sparkling water and we had to tell him at least 3-4 times that we don't. Finally we got our actual drinks and wanted to place the food order. For some reason, the waiter stopped coming to our table. We witnessed other tables order and eat their appetizers and order and get their entrees while we got no service. Finally after being in the restaurant for over 30 minutes (and not placed an order yet) my wife had enough and left the table to find the manager. During this time, the waiter came to our table and said ""I saw you were talking, I didn't want to interrupt you"" which is a rather odd excuse - were we supposed to sit in silence to get serviced?

My wife returned with the manager who was a class act and we got assigned another waiter who was attentive and fantastic for the rest of the night. We decided to share the risotto. I'm not claiming to be expert in Italian food despite being in Italy for over 10 times, but the rice was simply too hard. I'm aware of the fact that you're not supposed to overcook it to a point where it's mushy but too hard is too hard. I was hoping to eat Italian food that's spectacular but it was actually below average and very pricey."
Ristorante Sotto Sotto	4	2019-01-03	"The ambience here is romantic and elegant. The service is amazing and the food is good. 

I like getting their pasta here. The pasta dishes may be small but they are rich in flavor. I've had some of their seafood dishes and I enjoyed those as well. Not every item I've tried was impressive but the food is good in general. 

Overall, I think Sotto Sotto is a decent spot for Italian fare if you are in the area. The ambience is lovely for a night out."
Ristorante Sotto Sotto	5	2019-05-01	"This restaurant has been on my list since hearing it in a Drake song and didn't disappoint. 

We ordered the grilled calamari, scallops, carbonara, gnocchi, and the tiramisu and chocolate lava cake for dessert. The scallops were a bit salty but overall, everything was delicious! My personal favourite would be the gnocchi. The service was also amazing - our server was friendly and attentive. 

As an added bonus, got to see Drake and Jimmy Butler!"
Ristorante Sotto Sotto	5	2019-12-29	"As an Italian chef myself, there aren't many restaurants where I would dine unless it's my own or Sotto Sotto. 
Hands down one of The Best Italian Restaurant in Ontario."
Ristorante Sotto Sotto	5	2018-10-12	Great recommendation from Max at the Ritz Carlton.   We were celebrating my husband's 40th birthday.   We had the scampi appetizer, which came with three perfectly cooked scallops.  Husband order the carbonara and I had the angel hair pasta with shrimp,arugula, and tomato sauce.  We shared a 1/2 liter of Chianti ($45.00).  Total bill was 145 Canadian dollars.  Everything was perfectly seasoned and pasta al dente.  Restaurant is small, dimly lit and quaint and our server was very helpful.
Ristorante Sotto Sotto	4	2018-10-18	"Top 3 Italian in the city.  

Nice atmosphere. Valet parking. Great service. Very tasty Italian with gluten free options. 

Ask for the house made fresh stuffed  pasta.  

My date and I had an amazing stuffed pasta that was off the menu.  This was one of the best pasta dishes I've had in the city. 

The lamb melts in your mouth.  They lay the fish out for display which is great for assessing freshness."
Ristorante Sotto Sotto	4	2018-06-03	"I'm on a classic Toronto restaurant tour this year, and so Sotto Sotto was a must visit. 

The last time I came here was probably a decade ago and I remember it fondly, but feeling a little out of place because of the prices. This time round, I'm finding the prices still an issue. 

The food is good. A solid 8/10 for Italian. But the place is just old and run down now. The service is great, there's no doubt about it. There's a reason why this restaurant has been around for as long as it has. However, when you spend the amount that you do at this restaurant, there are comparatively better options in Toronto now. So while the price made me feel out of place 10 years ago, now the price makes me feel I can get better value elsewhere."
Ristorante Sotto Sotto	5	2019-10-25	"Sotto Sotta is a spectacular restaurant. The pasta is particularly delicious; homemade, flavourful, and generously portioned.

I enjoyed my birthday and would recommend celebrating special occasions at Sotto Sotto at any time."
Ristorante Sotto Sotto	5	2018-11-05	Some of the best gnocchi I've ever had (and I'm a gnocchi connoisseur). Perfect portion size, still had room for dick after dinner.
Ristorante Sotto Sotto	3	2019-05-06	"It's in yorkville and it has a cool name so it must be good, right? Right! Only, it doesn't get any better than good. Took my sis for her bday and was so shocked at how basic the flavours were. My mom got the four cheese spaghetti-- it was drippy n barely had taste. Mine was 7/10--a chicken dish, sister said her pasta was ""more wet than buttery"". The best part about this place was the beautiful interior and great service. I wish I liked the food more bcoz everyone seemed so nice."
Ristorante Sotto Sotto	4	2018-04-05	"Classy high end italian restaurant. Very dimmed, the waiters need a flashlight to see the menu with the customers. It was fine for us but older individuals might not be able to see the menu. I saw an older man looking at the menu as far as he could hold haha.

The washroom is upstairs close to where the kitchen is. It's an inconvenience how far it is but the washroom is pretty. There is a vanity section for the ladies. 

Food was amazing. Spectacular. Every dish was great and is truly authentic. Their seafood done to perfection. Lovely selection of wine. Complimentary bread.

Service was accomadating but very cliche. The moment we paid, he stopped coming to us. Still half a bottle of wine left but did not stop at all to finish pouring."
Ristorante Sotto Sotto	5	2018-11-29	Came here because of the lyric in the Drake song and it was a really authentic experience. Would completely recommend it- thanks Drake.
Ristorante Sotto Sotto	4	2019-05-22	"Haven't been to this restaurant in years but came tonight to celebrate a birthday. We were seated promptly, but unfortunately upstairs next to a large and loud group of men so it was a little hard to carry on a conversation. The service was excellent...warm, professional, and efficient. We shared several appetizers..all very good. One of our party ordered the mussels as a main course. They were a little too ""fishy"" so they were immediately taken back and replaced with an acceptable pasta dish. My ""Vitello de la Nonna"" was delicious. The others enjoyed their mains as well. This restaurant is worth another visit to see if they can live up to their 5 star potential."
Ristorante Sotto Sotto	3	2018-07-19	"Was here to celebrate my bestfriend's birthday. To start of with the service, I thought it was ok..we always had to ask for water refills. I didn't feel that the service was upscale enough for such a sophisticated, classy Italian restaurant.

Our server was knowledgeable and he made some recommendations. He suggested our party to order the Antipasto Gordonia ($24.95 pp) to share as we were all seafood lovers. I enjoyed the grilled calamari and tiger shrimps but everything else on that platter was mediocre. In terms of main, I ordered the Spaghetti Alla Carbonara ($22.95). The texture of the pasta was cooked to perfect al dente which I love. Flavour was rich but a bit too salty for my liking. My other friend who ordered a tomato based sauce mentioned her dish tasted like something she can make at home herself. Overall, food was just ok; nothing special. 

I probably won't come back as I feel that this one time experience is enough for me unless a friend of mine plan to host a party here in the future."
Ristorante Sotto Sotto	5	2017-11-05	"I went to Sotto Sotto tonight for dinner with my husband. It was his 36th birthday. This was hands down the best experience I've ever had at any restaurant. 

We made resos and were promptly taken to our table as we walked in. The service was totally on point. Our servers name was Frank. He was sooo good and honestly checked in just enough times to make sure we didn't need anything. 

We ordered the share platter app, I had the mushroom pasta and my husband had the salmon pasta. For dessert we had the cannoli and melted lava cake with a latte. I can't tell you how delicious the food was. Hands down the best pasta we've ever had. The ambiance, the lighting and the service was all top notch. 

I would highly recommend this place and am gonna add this to a regular spot for date nights !! Loved it."
Buca	5	2020-02-16	"One of my new favorite restaurants! Their menu changes constantly, but there are classics that stick around. I visited on Valentine's Day and was pleasantly surprised by how spacious it was inside as the exterior looked unpromising. The entrance can be difficult to find, as you need to walk down an alley facing King St.

The atmosphere inside was perfect for a date night - gently lit and very romantic. All of their meats are cured in house, and you can see it as you walk through the restaurant. Service was unbeatable - our server was very helpful in providing recommendations (as it was our first visit), and checked on us after each course. Water glasses never went empty, and the table was wiped down frequently.

As for food...

Tonno ($19): albacore tuna, my favourite dish from the evening. I'm a big fan of tuna and this dish was not only visually appealing, it was a delight on the palate. I could probably eat 5 plates of this myself, as it's so light and refreshing. Don't be intimidated by the chilis - it's definitely not a spicy dish.

Nodini ($8): tiny bread knots with garlic and olive oil, they were so crispy I thought they were fried (but they're not!) a must try if you visit, one of their most popular menu items.

Cervello ($10): lamb brains wrapped in prosciutto, it was a little salty for my liking, and lamb brains are definitely an acquired taste (really it's the texture more than the taste), but a really interesting experience if you're feeling adventurous.

Salumi di buca ($32 for 5): we opted for the soppressata and petto d'oca, which came with pickled eggplant preserves on the side. Delectable, and easy to see why it's such a popular item on the menu. You can customize your board, choosing between 2-5 meat options (they also offer a cheese board).

Bigoli ($26): duck egg pasta with duck offal ragu, the serving size is small, but the taste was unbelievable. You can tell from one bite that the pasta was made in-house. Since we tried so many things on the menu the small serving size didn't bother me, but if this is all you plan on ordering, you may leave a little hungry.

Pizze bianca ($30): I can't remember the name of the pizza as it was a special menu item, but it was topped with grilled pears and salumi and was an absolute treat. The pizzas here are a decent size, with an ultra thin crispy crust.

Tiramisu ($15): classic Italian dessert, enjoyable, but it was about 80% cream and only 20% ladyfingers. I'd recommend you share this with someone else as it's quite heavy.

Panna cotta ($15): topped with black cherries, cookie crumble, and balsamic reduction, again a very heavy dessert and I wasn't a fan. The toppings were incredible but the panna cotta itself was very tough (almost like a hard jello), and virtually flavourless.

The prices are steep for the small portion sizes, but it's a treat if you do decide to visit."
Buca	5	2020-01-30	"One of the most celebrated names in Italian food in Toronto is Buca. With two locations in the city, Chef Rob Gentile's original restaurant opened in 2009 in the Fashion District. You don't have to look far to find the accolades. Canada's 100 Best Restaurants listed them at #3 in 2015, #17 in 2016, #16 in 2017, #44 in 2018, and #45 in 2019. Toronto Life has them at #39 on their The City's 100 Best Restaurants 2018 list. And blogTO calls them the #1 Best Italian Restaurant in the city. What's the difference between the (original) Fashion District location and the one in Yorkville? It's mainly that the Yorkville restaurant focuses more on seafood offerings while the Fashion District upholds the classics that everyone loves. Both locations are excellent and offer the exact same consistency and high level of culinary perfection.

The word ""buca"" in Italian translates to hole. Which makes sense because the restaurant pretty much resides in one. Formerly a boiler room, the space is now an expansive and gorgeous restaurant comprised of towering ceilings, all of the exposed brick that you could imagine, and industrial-cool light fixtures. Where the Yorkville location feels more polished and modern, this one is rustic and mysterious. It actually feels a bit like dining in a wine cellar, among stacked bottles and wine barrels. Finding the entrance on King Street can be a little bit tricky because the signage isn't extremely obvious and you have to enter through the laneway. Then you proceed down the stairs and into the depths of the subterranean feast that awaits you. I visited on a Saturday evening - for my birthday, no less. The room is always full of customers and a reservation is certainly recommended.

Met by the friendly and professional staff at the bottom of the stairs, our coats were whisked away and we were seated at our table immediately. The experience felt special right from the very start.

In need of a beverage, I found myself looking over the list of seasonal and house cocktails. I also appreciated the addition of virgin cocktails, because there are certainly times when I don't feel like drinking alcohol but still appreciate the opportunity to order something interesting. However, this wasn't one of those times and the seasonal Frutto Divino (Fresh persimmon puree, calvados, chamomile, lime, egg white - $17.00) was calling to me. The persimmon in this 2oz cocktail caught my attention as it's my favourite seasonal fruit around the holidays. The egg white is the component that sealed my decision. This beverage was expertly mixed and tasted grown-up yet sweet at the same time. I loved the punchy zip from the lime and the fragrant sweetness from the persimmon.

The food at Buca is very serious business, although it somehow feels relaxed. The locally sourced, constantly changing menu involves ingredients that are seasonal and source specific. Nose-to-tail cooking is embraced at Buca (which I especially love). The hospitality is also top-notch, with every staff member exuding a welcoming and knowledgeable disposition. I was so ready to eat!

One famed menu item that I'd kept hearing about over and over was the Salumi di Buca (Selection of 5 salumi served with seasonal preserves - $32.00), a platter of incredible artisan cured meats. So of course the feast began with that. From left to right:

Speck: (which comes with the gnocco fritto, see below).

Petto d'Oca: Cured goose breast, cinnamon, clove, orange.

Salame Toscano: Cured beef sausage, black pepper.

Finocchiona: Cured pork sausage, black pepper, fennel.

Soppressata: Cured beef sausage, calabrese spices.

Salsiccine: Spicy calabrese style pork sausage.

We also added the Gnocco Fritto (Tuscan spiced dumplings, speck - $10.00), a personal favourite, which was served on the same board. This whole entire situation was heavenly. Served with an acidic eggplant preserve (which served amazingly to cut through some of the fat), the beautiful presentation of meats ranged from spicy soppressata to a decadent goose breast that tasted like Christmas. Each one was unique, expertly seasoned, and fragrantly herbed. Largely based in seasonal offerings, I want to keep returning to order this so that I can try different meats every time. A beautiful sharing experience.

The gnocco fritto, a warm, pillowy fried bread, especially owns my soul. From the perfectly uniform shape of each one, to the steamy aroma as you tear them apart, these are what dreams are made of. Served with buttery, melt-in-your-mouth speck, an intensely flavourful cured ham.

I also couldn't resist the Nodini (Warm bread knots, olive oil, rosemary, garlic - $8.00). At this point I was willing to accept that this meal was going to be extremely carb-heavy. I mean, who says ""no"" to perfect little bread balls? A golden, buttery crust on the outside that gives way to a warm and soft inside. All soaking in a garlicy bath.

So things were going well.

Next I took my attention to the Paste section because"
Buca	3	2019-09-30	"The pasta is really good. You can tell it's homemade once you take a bite. However, prices are quite high with portion sizes small. I ordered the duck pasta and felt I wanted more pasta but I guess it's filling but I don't think it's worth the price. I love my desserts but all their desserts were over $15 so I passed. The service was good and attentive.

They do not do separate cheques. Therefore, if you come with a large group be prepared to grab your calculators so you can split the bill easier. I'm a little annoyed that the host never checked me in with my open table reservation which resulted in a warning email from Open Table for a No Show. He did resolve it after the phone call but it was quite inconvenient to have to call the restaurant to have them fix the problem."
Buca	4	2019-08-25	"Buca has long been one of Toronto-proper's go-tos for Italian food. It costs a pretty penny, but it does so with good reason.

It's relatively upscale - not elaborately, but enough that it borders on pretentious. For instance, if you want to pack up your food to take home, they'll do it for you and give you a coat check ticket to pick up your food on the way out the door. That's overkill if you ask me, but a nice touch regardless.

I had a chance to sample an assortment of pizzas and pastas. The quality of their pizza toppings are unreal - the funghi is especially good and was my favourite dish of the evening! The pastas are cooked al dente, but I found my sampled dishes to be -too- al dente. The sauces were quite nice though.

Also, don't miss their tiramisu - it's probably one of the best I've had in Toronto."
Buca	5	2019-08-16	"Dinner for 4 on Thursday - Summer.  We were able to get in but highly recommend you to make reservation.  Two hosts, very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful.  We were seated in the comunal table (sits 8, but no one else joined). Great view to the kitchen.

Ambience is modern, dressy.  Great for special occasions.  You will feel you are in a restaurant in Italy.  Big open floor but somehow allows for intimate conversations.  Most people were enjoying one another and their food.

Prosciutto and selection of 3 cheeses were very tasty.  Prosciutto directly from Parma.  Best cheese of the 3 was Parmigiano (other two were Peccorino and Mozarella di Buffala).

For entrees:  Capeletti was our favorite dish- pasta filled w ricotta, lemon sauce and mushrooms.  Maccheroncini was a close second call- tomato sauce was so tasty and natural!.  Pomodoro e Tartufo pizza was done to perfection.  I noticed other reviews calling the weird shape of their pizzas.  Nothing weird about that.  Perfectly shaped and done Italian style.  Again, we felt we were in Italy.

Desserts: Torta Amalfi (almond based cake w fruit) was very tasty, recommend to share between 2 or 3.  Their gelatos were fluffy and flavorful.

Lastly, as expected, they had a very good selection of wines.  Their Italian list is very extensive.  We opted for a bottle of Nebbiolo and it paired very well w our dinner."
Buca	4	2019-05-22	"Came here with a few friends for dinner, we had a reservation. The high ceilings and ambient lighting make for a beautiful dining experience!

I ordered the SCIALATIELLI (don't ask me to pronounce this because I have no idea) as I can't have tomato-based pasta and this white pasta was recommended by the server. Of course, portion sizes are on the smaller side but the dish was very rich. We didn't order any appetizers but next time I come back I would definitely recommend sharing an appetizer in addition to the main, as I left a little bit hungry.

We also ordered a bottle of red wine to share, needles to say they only have Italian wines in their selection. 

Overall, it was a great experience to dine here with friends, we spent almost 4 HOURS here talking and having a great time! A part of that was because the server never came to check on us and we actually had to flag them down when we wanted to leave. Oh well!"
Buca	5	2019-09-29	"I came to Toronto with a few bookmarks after stalking Instagram. 
Yelp isn't very helpful in Toronto because most places don't have a lot of reviews. This place, however had plenty and most were good. 
We canceled our reservation at the CN tower restaurant which we'd heard wasn't as good as the view so...
Buca is in a very cool part of the city and full of smartly dressed locals. 
The server (tall, good looking Italian- sorry, I didn't get his name) was very sweet, patient and helpful. We debated in a few things and went with his recommendations each time. We were not disappointed. From the wine to the app and main, we were very pleased. I can't recommend the bison carpaccio enough.  The pasta with the goat ragu melted in my mouth. 
I would have loved to have dessert, but didn't have room. 
Definitely make your way to buca. You won't be disappointed"
Buca	4	2019-10-24	"Always had pleasant experience here. The food is good, and service is fast even on the busy nights. Some dishes have more of an acquired taste though so I try to go for something basic. Great burratas and wine selection.
Took one star off for it being overpriced for the amount of food you get"
Buca	4	2019-07-16	"We came for dinner on a Monday night and there was still a decent number of people within the restaurant even though it was a work night. The service was really nice as they helped suggest the best sellers of the restaurant.

Food:  For dinner, we had two pastas: Bigoli and Spaghetti Al Nero di Maiale and two pizzas: Prosciutto con Cipolle and Funghi. The duck ragu (Bigoli) was AMAZING, rich and perfectly cooked at al dente. The spaghetti had a unique taste in which it had a strong smoked taste which is not for everyone. I would recommend the prosciutto pizza because with the fresco it was delicious. On the other hand, the funghi had an overpowering Gorgonzola taste. Do not recommend! 

Overall, this meal was a bit pricey but it would be a great location for a date night as the ambience is dim, classy and rustic."
Buca	4	2019-08-30	Good food, but the pasta and pizza was a little saltier then expected (But still good)!  Sevice was okay as well
Buca	5	2019-08-05	"We came here for my birthday dinner. Off the bat, the ambience was wonderful. Lightly dimmed, warm setting and small but inviting space. We started off with the salumi di Mare platter. I didn't think that you can turn seafood into a salami-type dish, but apparently you can and it was absolutely wonderful and unique. We also had the seasonal oysters which were very worth it. The caviar and the arugula addition gave them a great taste.

We finished off with the nodini and the funghi, and I highly recommend both.

In my eyes, the star of the show was the dessert, which was a cake with hazelnut, squid ink, and olive oil. We were a bit apprehensive at first but the combination of ingredients was magical, to say the least! It was very light and airy, yet rich.

I recommend this restaurant for anyone who wants to trespass the reigns of what they think Italian godo should be, and try something new. We will definitely be coming back for our next special occasion!"
Buca	1	2019-10-20	"Service was horrible. I cant explain with the words. We waited a lot for everything. The bill came 15 minute after I asked. Pasta was extremley small but i cant understand this shit. Why dont you put more pastocon the plate ? Pasta is super cheap thing also there is no cheaper pasta than $22. Like just put some more that than i can say it worth! 

Terrible experience I dont reccomend to people go there."
Buca	5	2019-09-17	Definitely an experience of a lifetime. This is a good date night restaurant. The vibes, the food, just perfect. One thing to note is that the restaurant's entrance isn't on the main street so you have to walk through a cute alley to get there. Also, it's super busy on the weekends, so I recommend making reservations ahead of time. Their food was amazing, from the starters to the mains. I will definitely recommend this place to anyone who's looking for good Italian food.
Buca	4	2018-12-09	"Came here for a friend's birthday dinner, but was only able to stay for a glass of wine and some appetizers. The service is swanky; waiters are able to explain the menu quite extensively, and ours took the craft of wine very seriously (uncertain whether he was a sommelier). There were certain parts in the night where service, however, was surprising and poorer than expected. May I also mention that their website menu isn't up to date? Makes it difficult for a foodie to choose beforehand!

We started with a bunch of appetizers, listed below.

Charcuterie & Cheese Board
We chose an array of five different meats and cheeses, which came served with three different preserves. It was, quite frankly, very shocking that the board didn't come with any bread or crackers. When prompted and asked, the server point blank asked if we'd like to order the light fried bread (gnocco fritto) to go with the cheeses - for another $10! It therefore felt a bit cheap that they wouldn't even offer a bit of bread to accompany the salty cheese and charcuterie. As such, our experience of the board was a bit lacking; it was a little difficult to finish the remnants of the cheese.
We were told that the cured elk is very unique; Baro and one other restaurant in Western Canada are the sole providers of this elk. The elk certainly tasted interesting! The spices used made it taste like gingerbread and Christmas. Haha! A crowd favourite was the spicy salami (salsiccine), though my favourites were the leaner meats... Unfortunately, can't remember their names!
With regards to cheese, we only hoped that there was some bread. That said, everyone had their distinct preferences. I like milder cheeses, and so enjoyed the parmigiano.

Nodini 
This app probably offered the highest value with regards to quantity / price. There were roughly 12 knots, which were flavourful, warm, and had a nice crunch. My only criticism is that they could have been a little softer (I found them a little dense and dry) and they were swimming in a touch too much olive oil.

Parmigiana di Melanzane
This was my favourite appetizer of the evening! The fried eggplant was lightly breaded and wonderfully crisp. The tomato sauce with the tanginess of the ricotta was super delicious and addicting! The appetizer is quite small for its price point, and so we got 2 to share among the 6 of us.

We also ordered two bottles of red wine... It was really nice! Unfortunately I forgot the name, but it was quite medium/full-bodied, without any harsh acidity or dryness, and went down smoothly. The rest of the party continued to order mains and desserts, but I had to leave early.

I was surprised to hear that they don't separate bills - as such, I had to do the math first and pay my part separately. How interesting! I also appreciated the Italian cookie given as a takeaway favour. The amaretti cookie was chewy and doughy, and had a wonderful almond flavour. I loved it!

Overall, I found Buca to be quite pricey with very small portions. Would I go again? Probably not, unless there was a special function of sorts!"
Buca	1	2019-05-22	"We came here (King St location) Tuesday evening to take our guests from Vancouver to a nice dinner. Buca has been my favorite Italian spots in Toronto and has been my top recommendation for good restaurants in the city. We never once had a negative experience at Buca until last night. It was very disappointing to be in such a classy restaurant only to be treated poorly by their servers. We ordered charcuterie and pasta amongst the 5 of us. As we finished our dinner, we had told our server to pack up my bigoli pasta. As I picked up my takeout box, I realized it was not what I ordered. I quickly told the server that this was not mine and to my surprise, she yelled ""f*** off"" and stormed off in the kitchen. We were in shock as to why she responded this way. She returned shortly after, visibly disgruntled, and told me to stay put while the manager comes to talk to me. The manager arrives and simply tells me to wait while they make a new one for me to take home. She was not apologetic at all. Mind you, we had to wait 30 minutes for them to make the pasta again and as soon as I received it, they did not even acknowledge the fact that it shouldn't have taken that long. 

Mistakes happen but under no circumstances should servers be swearing at their customers. We are extremely confused as to what led to such aggresive remarks when we were the ones who had to wait 30 minutes to get our takeout. Definitely not going back after this incident. Servers were rude and ruined our evening."
Buca	5	2018-05-02	"We finally got to Buca (King W, Toronto) for my Birthday. 

I'm so happy that we did, you can tell they take prides in what they serve there. Every little detail is known by the staff so you feel like you're getting the experience of passion, and a unique dish. 

After requesting our servers top picks (as I always do) she insisted that we allow the kitchen to choose for us (umm.. maybe on another budget lady $55 for a personal pizza, maybe if you're buying) and then suggested we pair something from every section of the menu, followed by an entree each. (Really, who eats like this?) I felt slightly annoyed by her lack of flexibility with recommendations. 

My BF and I shared the 'PARMIGIANA DI MELANZANE' ($16) it was mouth watering and I LOVED it, he thought it 'was good but didn't blow his mind' I would recommend trying it but it's not a huge portion so, perfect for two.

I originally went thinking I would try the 'gnocchi' as it came highly recommended but, our server mentioned that the menu had just changed so it would most likely be a different one and suggested I go for something 'different.'  I agreed so I went with what she described as a house favourite. 

I ended up with the 'BIGOLI' ($24) torchio extruded pasta, duck offal ragu, Venetian spices, mascarpone, basil. It was rich (comparable to a thicker cream based sauce), I liked it but wouldn't order again. Personally, it felt liked pasta and blended cream sauce. I need something added for texture/ variety. I didn't personally wow me, especially in contrast to his entree which was the 'CRESC'TAJAT' ($28) we both preferre. The pasta with octopus, mussels and tomato base was phenomenal!! I had plate envy the entire time, watching him grab different bites lol. 

Anyway I can't complain not a morsel of food was left from any of our 3 dishes, and we were seriously stuffed to the brim. 

Next, I need to try their branzino, gnocchi & pizza! 

Definitely, can be on the pricey side if you add a bottle of wine, two entrees and an app to share (our bill came to $160 ish) forgot to mention, instead of your typical dessert that restaurants usually give you for your Birthday they gave us a pasta dish take home and two small cookies"
Buca	4	2018-10-09	"Buca is straight up wonderful! 

Great food and great service. Make sure you book ahead if you plan to go on weekends! 

Let's get into the review 

Atmosphere 7/10 
For me this aspect I'd give Buca good but not great. As you enter the doors (be weary the area is under construction and can be difficult to find) you walk down a set of stairs to the host counter where you are promptly greeted and take to your table (we arrived early on a Wed evening and were seating without problem). As we settled in, the restaurant was surprisingly loud for having only half the tables full, but as the evening went on It wasn't straining to have conversation among friends. 

Service 8.5/10
Our kind, knowledgable server, Justina, was very helpful throughout the evening. As Buca's menu has many tasty options and each dish has Italian names and it can be a bit tricky to navigate. This was not a problem as Justina was prompt to make some suggestions on top of some ideas our table had in mind for food. Through the duration of the evening she would regularly come to the table with water refill or to just check up and see how we we're doing. A bonus was that she was very well versed with the wine menu and brought 3 sample tastings to the table before we picked the bottle we wanted! 

Food 8/10 

For fine dine Italian Buca does not disappoint. Though we may not have had some of the keynote dishes the menu has to offer we still managed to have a solid taste of what the restaurant is all about. 

1. Nodini (warm bread knots) 8$ (6/10) 
This rating isn't to say these were bad. It's a different take on bread that you'd normally get at most Itn. restos. They were warm, crunchy and the olive oil was good. Nothing too special. 

2. Gnocco Fritto w/ Pancetta 10$ (8.5/10) 
Another bread like app we had with our charcuterie board. These were fantastic! So fantastic we ordered it twice later on in the meal. Served to you on the charcuterie board these large pillow like pastries are fantastic.  Perfectly salted with an intriguing flavour they become quite addicting. 

3. Charcuterie board 21$ (7.5/10) 
For this portion of our apps, Justina was quite helpful in making suggestions as to what cured meats would go well. We had the cured pork salami, spicy pork sausage and cured pork leg. The board comes with a side of preservatives to balance the taste. 

4. Funghi Pizza 32$ (8/10) 
To start for a pizza this is quite pricey but they do not cheap out on the ingredients they use. Topped with seasonal mushroom, marscapone and gorgonzola, this pizza has flavours that linger in your taste buds after each bite. Well worth it to share if you're in a group. 

5. Seafood pasta w/ octopus, mussels 28$ (7.5/10) 
An neat take on a red sauce pasta. Seafood tasted fresh and noddles were perfectly al dente. 

6. Bigoli pasta w/ duck ragu and marscapone 24$ (7/10) 
Presentation of this dish was very pretty, and the flavour wasn't too bold. Overall it was tasty but i'm not sure if i'd have it again when I go back. 

7. Grilled whole sea bass w/ olives & preserved lemon 42$ (6.5/10) 
Fish was fresh tasting but I'm not sure if it's worth the price. Be careful when eating as some bones are still intact. There was some scales on the skin also. 

8. Prosciutto Pizza w/ pesto, asparagus and burrata cheese 30$ (7.5/10)
Same crust as the other pizza and the flavours went well together. The pesto added to the flavour of the cured meat and cheese shavings. 

9.  layered creme wafer w/ strawberry drizzle 10$ (7.5/10) 
This dessert was pretty tasty. Cream layered between 3 wafers sprinkled with icing sugar tasted fresh and simple. A good way to end the night. 

Overall Buca is a typical fine dine Italian with a few neat renditions on several dishes. Their attention to detail and the freshness they incorporate into every dish made this a restaurant I will be eager to visit again."
Buca	4	2019-08-23	I came here with my friend on a Saturday night. We started off with the Burrata and it was absolutely delicious with the fresh strawberries. I had the pork blood pasta after and it was savory with a strong sour and spicy flavor reminding me of some Sichuan food. What really stood out for me was the tiramisu. The layers of light and smooth cream paired well with the espresso. I love the subtle bitterness and the strong note of coffee. It's a real delight to have with a glass of the Vino Chinato.
Buca	5	2018-11-14	I just had the best friend eggplant, best mushroom pizza, best mussel pasta, best vinegar berry mocktails ever in my entire life. Hand down. It has been a long time that I feel like having ogasim from having dinner.
Buca	5	2018-11-14	Tried Bar Buca for years for brunch (one of my fave spots!) but finally got around to checking out Buca for dinner. Was not disappointed at all. Great venue, service and most of the food... the menu selection was better than I anticipated for someone who loves all sorts of food. Great choices and I was very pleased with the pig ears and duck pasta.
Agio	5	2020-02-12	"The best Italian food I have ever had - even better than the ones I had in Italy. 

The complimentary warm bread that's served with butter and olive + vinegar is simple but good. The owner gave us complimentary appetizer which is amazing - grilled zucchini with pumpkin on top. The star of the show was the lobster spaghetti. The spaghetti was done al dente and the sauce is out of this world, the lobster was a good size and tender but has a bite to it. The clam pasta has so many clams. The portion sizes for all the dishes are big and you will be leaving full and satisfied. Also worth noting is the fried calamari and spinach cheese ravioli with this sauce on top..SO GOOD. The owner also gave us free creme brûlée to share was also fantastic.

If you are a fan of Italian food and you haven't tried this place yet, you're definitely missing out."
Agio	4	2019-07-03	"Interesting spot.
Owner, chef is friendly (not phoney, which I appreciated). 
I appreciated the fair price and quick service.
Decor is NOT great, needs tables, chairs, etc..  it's clean, most importantly.
Really enjoyed the spaghetti w meatballs."
Agio	4	2019-10-11	"I went here for my dinner on a Monday night! 
This place is a one man show! Excellent food, everything freshly made with nice flavours! I was told that they make fresh pasta but i dont think so. Also, 4 stars only because the Tiramisu wasnt the best. Maybe needs to work better on the desserts part of the menu!
Otherwise, food was great! My fav was the limon pasta!"
Agio	3	2019-12-05	"The food was enjoyable, the service was friendly, and the price was reasonable.

However, though my party of four were the only ones in the restaurant aside from another couple, it took very long for our food to come out. I can't imagine how long it would take if it was a full house.  Based on other reviews here, this seems like an ongoing problem at Agio.

The decor is also a mismatch to what they're trying to be... a restaurant that serves high end Italian cuisine. It's basically a hole in the wall here, well below average in all aspects (floor, tables, decor, walls, washrooms, etc)"
Agio	2	2019-07-27	"I came on a Monday around 5pm with two other people. We ordered 3 dishes (ravioli, lobster pasta and shrimp with veggies) and spent over 100$. Here is a short pros and cons list: 

Pros: 
- The food is good 
- The chef gave us some bread with butter, vinegar and olive oil on the side. He also gave us some baked zucchini as an appetizer. 
- He seems knowledgeable about Italian cuisine. He said that he cooked in Italy for 7 years. 
- a lot of street parking nearby

Cons: 
- The restaurant smells like cat. The odour was very strong. 
- The bathroom is in the basement with a very very low ceiling. It reminded me of the bathrooms one would expect to see at a campsite, so it's very usable, but lots of bugs. 
- The decor is very outdated. 
- Too expensive. The ravioli dish was composed of 4 big ravioli. The lobster pasta was also a fair portion. The shrimp with veggies was my main issue. It cost over 25$ if I recall correctly. It was 3 shrimp with a handful or two of steamed veggies. For the price we paid, we expected more. After we finished our meal, we were still not fully satisfied. We ended up going somewhere else and eating more. 

In my opinion, the cons greatly outweigh the pros. There are many other cleaner Italian restaurants that serve much more equally delicious food for the same price."
Agio	4	2018-11-20	"This place is a hidden gem and the prices are great! It looks like the restaurant needs some renovation, but don't be fooled by the interior, the food here is great!

Service:

The owner is very friendly and welcoming. He is the chef as well. The service was attentive and the server ensured everything was going well.  

Food:

Lobster Risotto - This was very creamy and cheesy. I took one bite and I knew right away that this is something I would order again if I return in the future. Highly recommend this if you eat here.

Gnocchi - The gnocchi is handmade and it was delicious. The texture of the gnocchi was amazing. The gnocchi was in a rose sauce and this was very tasty. 

Overall:

I enjoyed the food here very much; I absolutely love the pasta here! The prices are also very good for the food quality. I will definitely return to try more pasta."
Agio	5	2020-02-19	"What else can I say but amazing Italian food. I have been there 3 times and never have been disappointed. I have tried various items from the menu and all have been great. Some of my favourites:
Appies: Grilled Eggplant with Ricotta cheese, Grilled King mushroom
Pasta: Anything with lobster!, Spaghetti with meatballs or Ragu

This place is an unassuming friendly little joint that doesn't pretend to be pretentious. The prices are reasonable - A large lobster with pasta for $40?! and the chef is super friendly. As other Yelpers have indicated, this is not a place that will impress you with its decor and ambiance but the food is the star of the show, as it always should be. 

From what I can gather, small talk with the chef and pictures adorned on the walls, the chef (Korean descent?) has been classically trained in Italian cooking from other master Italian chefs. And yes, he has definitely learned well from them!  

Give this place a try. You will not be disappointed. Trust your instincts and trust the yelp rating!"
Agio	4	2019-02-24	"To be honest, when I walked into this small restaurant, I was shocked because it looked very small and outdated! It was quite sketchy. However, when the food was here,OMG! The seasoning of my lobster pasta is perfect! I was not a big fan of tomato sauce nor the carbs. But I forgot about my diet plan and had LOTs of pasta! My husband order the steak, which was seasoning perfect as well. The cut of meat was great and favour is right at the point. 
Well the only downside was the home made tiramisu, which was very disappointed. I had lots of different types of tiramisu in Italy and Italian restaurants. This one was definitely on the AVOIDLIST. 
However, I'll go back soon to try other dishes for sure!"
Agio	5	2018-05-04	"Amazing food!!  I would only recommend eating here if you have time to enjoy the food since at times it's a one-man show and it may take a while to get your meal.  I truly enjoyed all the things I tried here starting with the complimentary bread.  It was warm, crunchy on the outside and chewy in the middle...simple exquisite. 

Straciatella Soup$7.50  - This Italian egg drop soup is addictive and I had it every time I came here.

The chef brought out a complimentary zucchini bite appetizer while we waited for dinner and it was finger licking good.  The zucchini is grilled and topped with butternut squash and sauce.

Lobster pasta $38 - Daaaamn, this dish was hella delicious.  The lobster was fresh and meaty.  The pasta was perfectly cooked and covered in delicious tomato sauce.

Cauliflower Fritter $10.50 - These lightly breaded and deep fried cauliflowers were so good on their own that I didn't eat much of the 2 different dipping sauce that accompanied them.

Spaghetti Carbonara $18 - Loved it!  The sauce was creamy and flavorful.  The pasta was cooked just right.  Simple dish, but very satisfying. 

The dessert game here is not as strong as the rest of the food.  They offer tiramisu and crème brulee for $8.

Street parking right on St Clair was free and easy to find on a weekday.

Agio	3	2020-04-24	Terrific food, poor atmosphere, great customer service.  They deliver and are open during covid!
Agio	5	2020-03-21	Really nice guy running this restaurant and excellent food. All pasta is handmade, sauce home cooked. Yoy can tell this chef learned his trade in Italy
Agio	4	2018-10-14	"Our entire meal was fresh and delicious!

We were given a warm loaf of bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, followed by an amuse bouche of grilled zucchini topped with mashed sweet potato and a balsamic glaze. A lovely way to start our meal. 

Next came the mozzarella fritters with a chunky tomato sauce. They were rounds of mozzarella in a bread crumb coating. They were light and crisp, melty and yummy! You could see and taste the herbs and the delicious saltiness went perfectly with the sweet freshness of the tomato sauce. Our main dish was Agio's gnocci with porcini mushrooms and Alfredo sauce. It was rich, creamy with nice chunks of mushroom. The gnocci was cooked to the right texture and the mushroom and cream sauce was very rich, flavourful and satisfying. 

We finished our meal with a perfect creme brulee - a lightly sweet and super airy filling topped with a crunchy sugar shell. One of the best I've tasted in Toronto. 

Try Agio! (PS. Sorry I was too excited to eat that I forgot to snap pics of the fritters and the creme brulee!)"
Agio	5	2019-08-06	"We had the lobster pasta special and the salmon fillet with pumpkin seed crust tonight. Absolutely excellent. 

As it was our anniversary, the owner/chef gave us (my spouse) a lovely serving of tiramisu served in a martini glass. Nice.

This is definitely a local restaurant where food is treated in a special and personal way."
Agio	3	2018-12-12	"A difficult review to write... have had Agio bookmarked for a long time. 

Pitched it for my work lunch and because everyone trusted me Agio was booked. 

There were a few changes in numbers but the day before I did confirm 9 people with a birthday celebration. 

We arrive to a chilly empty restaurant at 12pm hungry and ready to try delicious pasta. 

We sit and ariund 1215pm i order calamari, trio bruschetta and cauliflower fritters to start. Half of us were there and the other half trickled in. The latest person arrive and we order entrees around 1240pm. 

At 115pm is when we first start to get appetizers. The friendly owner was the only one taking care of tables and cooking. 

Our entrees came around 145pm. The difficulty is that not everyone has a 2 hour lunch. The birthday girl ended up having to leave with no entree just apps because she had an appointment at 2pm. 

We finally wrapped up the meal around 215 with creme brulee on the house, the owner made it specifically for us the might before. 

I liked the apps, amuse bouche of squash stuff grilled zucchini. My spicy tomato spaghetti was delicious and pasta was fresh. 

The chef reminded us this several times that his food is made fresh. 

We ended up being the only table the whole time, off the lunch menu the meatballs werent available and half the table didnt love their entrees. Not 4.5 stars love anyways. 

Disappointing because I felt like the chef should have had someone come in to help or tell us the calamari cant be ordered becausr of the work behind it. Turned out chewy which was unfortunate. 

Just wish there was more communication. It was quite embarrassing for me to be responsible for a mediocre hangry people filled lunch :(

I was still defending the restaurant the next week... ill go back to try with a smaller group. 

It does have character I just don't think it was a good mix for a large group that didn't have 2.5 hrs for lunch."
Agio	4	2018-04-14	"I wanted to give this pace 5* because of their great service and freebies. I mean, it's a cute, tiny place, the 2 people who were staffing (older Asian man and youngish Asian girl) were nice, and they gave us a free app (squash on zucchini with some type of sauce) and a free crème brûlée at the end: 1 for 2 to share. 

So service-wise, it was a definite 5/5. I felt like a real VIP here. 

Carbonaras ($17) looked great and so did the coffees. However, they had run out of Italian coffee, so that was a tad odd. 

I had the lobster pasta in red sauce (that's actually its description, and the price of $38 was not disclosed in the menu). Man, that was a GIANT plate. Getting the meat was a real workout but worth. They gave a whole lobster with the proper equipment and lemon water so I didn't smell like PEI after. 

Lobster was good, I'm sure, but the sauce was too overwhelming to get the taste of lobster. Then again, lobster is generally mild but still. Pasta texture and all was great. Sauce was a little spicy but I think I should have mixed it all up first so the spice wasn't just on the top. 

Crème brûlée was great! The caramel was a little thick but I guess some like it thick. The custard was very smooth, no lumps, and it wasn't cold. I know that's a weird expectation but I've had cold, liquid custard before... as a crème brûlée. I def recommend this dessert. The portion was just right for 2 people. 

Would I recommend? Yes, because it's at an average price (maybe $1 pricier than other places) but with spectacular service."
Agio	5	2019-04-05	This is a hidden gem! If you are ever in the Toronto area, Agio is a must. Everything from the friendly service, cozy environment and authentic food was beyond incredible. I would highly recommend from the appetizer menu the cauliflower fritters, grilled and fried calamari. The owner also gave great recommendations for our main courses and they were all delicious. I will certainly visit again my next time in Toronto.
Agio	5	2020-01-04	"Excellent food! Do yourself a favour and eat here! 

Tiny little place a few steps from the corner of Lansdowne.  We were skeptical upon entering as it was completely empty on a sat night at 6.  We read reviews before choosing to come here and they were good so in we went.  Very small restaurant that fits about 30 people.  Lovely server was very attentive (possibly the owner's daughter?).  We ordered calamari fritti to start and while we waited for that, the chef made us a little plate of
Grilled zucchini topped with mashed butternut squash and balsamic glaze.  It was excellent. They also brought out freshly warmed bread with our wines which were reasonably priced and excellent.  Then came the calamari which you could tell was a freshly cut whole squid that was breaded and fried.  It was perfectly cooked and had a great sauce for dipping. Next came our pastas which were also perfectly done.  The sauces were excellent and pasta not overdone.  Lastly we had creme brûlée which was so good! Chef came out to speak to us and told us that he worked in an Italian restaurant in Japan for 6 years before going to Italy for another 6 years for more training.  The inside of the restaurant could be better but the food was absolutely divine.  My husband and I will definitely be back!"
Agio	5	2017-08-11	"Absolutely spectacular Italian food. Solid 5 stars. Walking into this restaurant feels like cottage, where it's a little run down, door is open, and washroom, I am short and the ceiling is low( never felt that tall before) Took me awhile to figure out the washroom as I was so focused on the bears hanging on the door.

The chef's wife paints really well. There were paintings on the wall done by his wife and the portraits on the side are the frequent customers, painted by his wife.

Table cloth was kind of like ones that your friend doesn't want but during university years, you will take it because you will take whatever is free. 

Having said all of that, the food was worth the lack of decor in the restaurant. It speaks for itself.

Appetizer: The oyster mushroom has a beef/steak taste to it. It was smoky and flavourful. 

The lobster ravioli (I selected the one with alfredo sauce) was around $42 but the pasta was cooked al dente. Big chucks of lobster inside. Worth every penny. 

The clam pasta, you really have to eat it with the clams otherwise the pasta does not have enough flavours. 

I came in feeling not hungry but walking out wanting another plate of lobster pasta!!!!

Tip: call to make reservations in advance, limited spots and chef is particular on that!"
Agio	3	2019-02-15	"Foods were good and we had a good time dining as a group. Unfortunately, nearing the end of our meal, we got yelled at by the chef for being late for our reservation. 
We apologize but he kept on going which makes it awkward for us and leaves a sour taste on otherwise a nice evening out with friends and good meal."
Agio	4	2019-10-06	My friend and I almost walked right out after arriving at Agio and finding ourselves the only 2 people there for at least 10 minutes. There were plenty of good reviews on Yelp so we decided to give it a chance. Things started to look up after the chef/owner finally came out of the kitchen. The restaurants decor is quirky and if you dont care about aesthetics, I think you will enjoy this restaurant. The Korean man knows his Italian food. His entertaining stories are a bonus.
Baretto Caffe	5	2020-04-09	"Amazing, family-owned caffe. The people, food, drink, ambience are all great!
Prosciutto, veggie and chicken paninis are my favourite lunch at Baretto. 
Order, takeout and enjoy soon!"
Baretto Caffe	3	2019-10-30	"The first thing that'll happen when you arrive (after a tiny struggle to find this place cus it's in the corner where the main entrance is) is that you'll be greeted by the nicest lady everrrrr! You can order at the counter for takeout or have a seat by the windows and she'll come over to take you order.

We ordered the alfredo pasta and a pizza. Pizza was a thin flatbread style pizza topped with some cheapo cheese. The alfredo pasta was a good size for the price but really tasted like nothing special. Pasta wasn't homemade and the sauce was pretty average. 

Service over Food here!"
Baretto Caffe	5	2019-10-29	"Absolutely another one of those hidden gems! I very much recommend going if you're looking for delicious yet affordable cheap eats!

I had the prosciutto bruschetta toast. Unlike the bruschetta with the diced tomato, this is more of your open sandwich idea. The bread was garlic bread! Super pleasing. The prosciutto was plentiful and the arugula was a great match.

We sat in and it took little time to get our food. The server was genuinely so nice and attentive. 

I really recommend stopping by and enjoy a no frills eating environment."
Baretto Caffe	2	2019-09-18	"I was so looking forward to trying this place out based on all the Yelp reviews and I'm sad to say, my experience here was not a good one.  The cafe is so quaint and located inside a non-descript office building with a cute Koi pond to the side.  

There were 3 people working during a busy-ish lunch time and it took them 15+ min to just take our order.  My daughter's cheese pizza came out first with extra sprinkling of Parmesan cheese which she hates.  It would have been nice to know that even a cheese pizza would come showered in Parmesan.  My husband's lasagna took 30 min to arrive with the same amount of Parmesan on top.  You can see the amount of Parmesan on the photos below.  This was perhaps the best dish of the day still.  The lasagna had a nice meaty sauce and was definitely a pre-made lasagna that was reheated which made us wonder why it would take 30 min to just reheat and serve a premade lasagna.  My fettucine primavera also came doused in too much Parmesan in a tomato sauce that was way too watery and sweet.  Let's just say my pasta was beyond disappointing.  

Based on this experience, I am not sure if I would return here any time soon."
Baretto Caffe	5	2019-08-07	"This cafe is tucked away inside a medical building.  I was skeptical at first when I went in as I was thinking this is probably just another run-of-the-mill cafe that takes advantage of the fact that people are waiting for their doctors or dentists or kids who are at the doctor or dentist and just need something to eat.  Boy was I wrong.

The space is elegant and clean.  Very spacious - tables are set a fairly good distance apart giving you the feel of privacy.  Decor is great and the music is a mixture of classical and, what I assume to be, European pop?  Ambience is definitely 5/5.

Service was great - the servers were kind, asked if it was our first time and explained their menu.  They checked in with us at appropriate frequencies to refill water and ask us how everything was. 5/5.

The food - great food for an unassuming cafe.  The lasagna was delicious and quite a large portion.  The side of greens was fresh and the garlic toast was great.  5/5 for the lasagna.  The prosciutto panini was good - nice crispy bread with delicious prosciutto, slices of tomatoes and lettuce inside - basic but still done well.  A little sad that it doesn't come with anything on the side but oh well - 4/5.

Value - I think this is what brings this place really up.  The lasagna was about $10.50, the panini $7.7 (before tax + tip).  The lasagna is totally worth it at that price point - really should have just gotten two of those.

Overall, quite a hidden spacious cafe that serves delicious food at reasonable prices."
Baretto Caffe	5	2019-05-25	"Uh I love this place. Super tucked away in a medical office centre, it may be easy to miss.

Service is IMPECCABLE, def à 5* restaurant quality. Very attentive, genuine, and happy. Two of the senior staff came to tend to my date and me, and were very glad to answer some questions about the menu.

The antipasto was BLISS. Lots of prosciutto to make it worth it, veg were very fresh. I loved the tomatoes, they're so lovely they gotta be organic. The owner came to suggest drizzling olive oil over it and he was right! It was phenomenally better, which I thought was already impossible.

I had the prosciutto rosé which was good but def eons away from the antipasto.

What I love is that the price point is excellent. It's my third time here and I def will return!"
Baretto Caffe	5	2020-03-11	Weird location and a bit confusing to find but totally worth it! You can take out or sit down and be served. Very friendly staff. I ordered Pasta with rossa sauce, delicious.
Baretto Caffe	5	2020-01-23	The rose pasta was so creamy and delicious. Highly highly recommend! Along with the hazelnut latte and white chocolate cappuccino, we thoroughly enjoyed our visit to this cafe. It was a bit hard to find at first and busy as we went around 1pm but it cleared up and we found a spot to sit. After trying the food, I understood why this place has a 5 star rating. You also get a free cappuccino if you spend over $20. The owners were so friendly and told us about the same cafe that their family owns in Italy.
Baretto Caffe	5	2019-02-06	"After my initial visit, I have become a regular here, visiting once a week to enjoy their delicious breakfast. It's one of the highlights of my week. Although I had come on Monday this week already, I decided to come again on Wednesday through the freezing rain because I needed a little pick me up. I definitely got more than that. 

The food was amazing as usual, and service was exceptional; they've always been consistent in terms of quality and professionalism. After enjoying my usual breakfast of croissant with fried egg and prosciutto and ginseng cappuccino (this coffee is addictive!), the owner, Manuel, gave me a brownie on the house. It was delicious! Moist cake with rich chocolate flavour which is not overly sweet (I mean, brownies are supposed to be sweet, right?). Thank you for making my day!"
Baretto Caffe	5	2019-07-26	"This place is hands down amazing. Came with a friend this Wednesday. As other reviews have stated, it is a bit hard to find the entrance, so use the pictures others have posted for reference! The waitress who tended to us was friendly and accommodating. 

I would die for the americano served here, please get it, the coffee is amazing, smooth, and light. 

The caprese salad is amazing, specifically the spices, and the mozzarella, which I believe was freshly made. 
We piled the salad on top of the bread given to us, and please do yourself a favour and try that, as it is amazing. The freshness of all the ingredients with an extra drizzle of balsamic on top of a warm crusty bread is near godly.

My friend's pasta was also spectacular. The pasta was perfectly cooked al denté, and the sauce was just creamy enough to the point where it doesn't overwhelm you. 

Overall, amazing restaurant, both my friend and I will be returning for many more times to come."
Baretto Caffe	5	2019-07-21	"This is one of my favourite newly found gems for great pasta! All the staff are extremely friendly and greet you right as you walk in. What's great about it is that you can't eat for here and pack it to go! Another great thing about Baretto Caffe is that you're able to pick what kind of pasta you'd like to eat (rotini, fettuccini, penne, etc.). I've had their rosé rotini pasta and it's to die for. It tastes very authentic to their culture and its great for its price. I'd like to say that their food was the star of the show, however their service and friendliness of all the staff really made it one of the most enjoyable and pleasant dining experiences I've had, if not the best! I would go here again :)

Food: 10/10
Service: 10/10
Worth?: 10/10"
Baretto Caffe	5	2019-12-23	This little cafe is a hidden gem, located in a medical building. We were greeted warmly by both staff upon arrival and seated promptly. The pasta and antipasto were both beautifully set and more importantly, had impeccable taste. The server came to check on us regularly throughout the meal. Definitely coming back for another quiet peaceful lunch!
Baretto Caffe	4	2019-06-15	"Finally I got a chance to check out this little place. We came here on Friday afternoon 3pm. Unfortunately their pasta was sold out. I was eager to try the pesto pasta. Instead we got Lasagna and Prosciutto pizza. Both were awesome. It was the best lasagna I had so far! 
I also try their latte which was very impressed as well. 
I will definitely come back to try their pesto pasta next time .
Decoration was modern and clean. Nice and quiet place for afternoon tea ."
Baretto Caffe	5	2018-11-12	"Definitely a hidden gem in this area. I was searching for restaurants around the area one day and came across this place with 5 stars. My first thought was they probably only have a few reviews to uphold the 5 stars rating but to my surprise, they have over 200 reviews! 

I had to give this place a try. It's hidden at the back of a medical centre with ample amount of parking at the back. The service is absolutely spectacular, as the owner and waiters came by a few times to check on us. They even gave us some free Italian pastries! The food was excellent with large portions. I checked in with Yelp and got a free cappuccino. I ordered the gingseng cappuccino and it was really good but slightly on the sweeter side. My party of five also ordered pizza and pasta and they all loved their dishes. 

This is definitely a place worth to try and the service you get is unbeatable. They deserve the 5 stars rating!"
Baretto Caffe	4	2018-09-12	"Completely hidden from the street as it's located inside a medical building.  Thank you for the Yelper who posted the photo of the actual building!  Otherwise, I would've missed it.  :)

Very, very close to a 5*!  The only reasons why it missed the mark was that the food took sometime after ordering, 20mins+.  And there was a missing ingredient in the Fantasia Salad - corn!  I didn't bother mentioning it 'cause we were soo hungry by the time the food arrived.

If you're looking for a quick meal, this is not the place for you.  Please allow some time to soak in the '80s Italo-Disco music and the owners kind demeanor!

Personally, if it were my first time, I'd order a caffeinated drink (good beans), pasta, pizza, panini, & pastry.  I'd skip the salads.  The Fantasia was good, but it's something that you can make at home.  Latté was smooth and very, very good!

Pasta with rosé sauce was DELICIOUS!  It arrived to the table piping hot and fresh tasting.  If you're not too hungry, it can definitely be shared btw 2 ppl as it also comes with some garlic bread + a side salad.

Owner was very nice, always checking in on us.  She was upbeat and always said, ""with pleasure"" and seemed to mean it!  There were some nice touches like providing us with place mats and glasses of water with ice.  Very warm atmosphere!

Too bad/thank God this place isn't located too close by.  Otherwise, it can be dangerous!"
Baretto Caffe	5	2018-09-11	"For a few years I've heard about this place, drove by this place, promised myself I'd stop by one day....and it finally happened!  It's an unassuming little cafe - tucked inside a medical building so it might be easy to miss - there is a sign out front indicating the cafe is in the plaza.

I checked in on Yelp and luckily check in offer is a free cap/latte/tea - yeah!   I also ordered a slice of the veggie pizza b/c I was a little hungry.  They do have a pretty good food menu - from breakfast items, to pizzas to pastas.  

Seating is in the front - a few tables and off to the side in a little room - which is so nice - fireplace, clean tables, nice art.  

The veggie pizza (the menu says they use whatever seasonal veggies they have on hand) was pretty good - medium crust, nice and crispy crust and you could see the veggies - mushrooms, peppers.  Not like some veggie pizzas where everything is diced up so fine you can't see anything.  It came with a little side salad.

I ordered the latte and it was nice - smooth and flavourful and they do latte art here!  I got the teddy bear :)  

I could hear the owners/staff greeting a lot of customers - so I assume quite a few people are regulars (assuming they are coming in to the medical offices first).  

I'll definitely be back!"
Baretto Caffe	5	2019-07-30	"Beautiful Cafe, bright, clean and airy. 
The staff were very friendly, the service excellent and the food was amazing!
We will definitely be back."
Baretto Caffe	5	2019-09-13	"Super cute little cafe in a non-descript building. 

Food is fresh, well priced, and delicious. 

I ordered the small prosciutto pizza. And my friend ordered the fettuccini pasta with Rossa. Both were very tasty. 

Service is friendly, efficiently and genuine. 

Nice little gem of a cafe."
Baretto Caffe	5	2019-11-08	"I have been wanting to come to this spot since my last visit to Toronto based on their offerings, the Yelp reviews and pictures. Today was the day. 

The location is a bit strange behind an office building where you need to enter into the office building to get to the cafe. Once you are there the service is very attentive, the food is wonderful and really authentic. The seating area is very quiet and just a refreshing break from the congestion of the city. 

I took my sister and brother in law who are locals and they will be back often based on our experience.

Thank you for starting our day with a joyfully experience."
Baretto Caffe	5	2020-02-18	Fyi adding to my previous update, the service is better than the food. I agree. The food is average but the service is exceptional. I certainly felt like I was in italy and given the VIP treatment however.
Sugo	5	2020-05-10	This might be the best restaurant in Toronto! Even during social-distancing, delivery has been easy and delicious.
Sugo	5	2020-05-23	"This place has high energy, amazing staff, and even better food! I came with 5 of my friends and ordered a large majority of the menu!

For starters, we got the burrata salad. It was a tad on the salty side, but other than that, the creamy burrata spilled on the tomato salad. But some of that on the bread they provide and you have yourself a bruschetta! 

They have an excellent deal where you can pair a protein with a side of pasta. In my case, I got the chicken parmesan with spaghetti. The noodles were el dente and the sauce was nice and tangy, which played the perfect pairing with the rich and hearty chicken parmesan. 

We also ordered the rigatoni with the vodka sauce and it was rich and delicious. On the side, we also got eggplant parmesan. It was fried nicely and seasoned very well. We also got the chicken parm sandwich and the deli sandwich. The deli sandwich was just okay, as it was outshined by the other dishes we got.

They also sell their homemade sauce and I grabbed one of those to get the Sugo experience at home! It didn't feel the same without the loud restaurant and friendly service staff. 

Overall, this experience was amazing and I will definitely be coming back."
Sugo	4	2020-04-13	"This place is advertised as a red sauce style joint and they have really hit the mark with that. I did take out, but got a chance to see the bustling dining room. Everyone seemed to be having a great time, and every dish looked fantastic. 

My partner and I got the chicken parm sandwiches and they were simply perfect. Soft bun, crispy chicken (perfectly done), and sauce to die for. Some extra toppings for extra measure. A side of Caesar salad, very garlicky, but I like it thar way. We also ordered the meatball appetizer, which is one meatball the size of a softball. How they cooked that perfectly through is beyond me, but it was great.

This place is a perfect combo of hip and classic. Staff had real character, but were attentive and friendly. I highly recommend Sugo."
Sugo	4	2020-03-18	"Dude - the food here is AMAZING. My boyfriend and I ordered the chicken parmesan sandwich and the rigatoni. We probably should have ordered the Sugo Platter, but didn't realize it was an option until afterwards. The rigatoni was definitely the star of the show - it was piping hot and full of flavor, with the pasta cooked perfectly.

The only reason I'm knocking a star off is because I'm a selfish American and they were taking American dollar-for-Canadian dollar to pay since we ran out of Canadian cash. It also seems like it would have been overwhelmingly busy if we had come at regular mealtimes, so try to go at a weird time like 3pm for lunch."
Sugo	5	2020-02-24	"Oh yes padre. I have been salivating over this place for for quite some time now and when I was able to finally visit I was glad to see I wasn't disappointed!

My friend and I went on a Friday night at 5pm and to our delight there was no line up! Their dining area is very small and they don't do reservations. It's decorated with red and white table linens and there's a simple chalk menu board above where the cashier is. This area is for takeout orders. We sat down and our waitress came by to give us some advice about her favs which helped.

We got mozzarella sticks to start which was served with their signature sugo. They were super tasty. We also got a caesar salad. It was very fresh and super garlicky, just the way I like it! My friend got the gnocchi that came with their signature sugo (sauce) and I got chicken parmigiana with spaghetti in sugo. They gave me 2 pieces of chicken, and the mountain of spaghetti was HUGE. I seriously had leftovers for 2 meals after that. 

The chicken parmigiana was magnificent, tender and flavourful. The spaghetti was cooked perfectly and sauce was deliziosa. I had some of my friend's gnocchi too and wish I got too because it was so tasty, light and fluffy little pillows of gnocchi heaven.

We got tiramisu afterwards to share for dessert. Honestly at this point I was surprised we were able to have anything else. The tiramisu was so good. A good portion and it was one of the best tiramisus I've ever had!

Can't wait to come back here for the other dishes!"
Sugo	5	2020-03-03	"This place is as good as they say and possibly even better. It is simple, but yet packed with flavour. How one could ever leave without a belly literally overfilled with pasta, I do not know. Each pasta is huge to begin with but getting the Sugo Platter is a great deal. There you can mix and match a veal/chicken/eggplant parm or meatball with their rigatoni/spaghetti/gnocchi pasta. Or you could dk a pasta and a salad. Whichever route you choose, be warned, it is a mountain full and you will be overly satisfied (if that's even possible). The desserts were also tremendously delicious. The tiramisu was wonderfully made, but the canoli was a favourite of mine. The ricotta filling was light with a hint kf lemon inside. I would go back just for that. But obviously the pasta is amazing too. 

I love Italian food and am DEFINITELY a fan of Sugo. It's probably a good thing I don't live close otherwise I'd be doing take out way too often.

Like all posts say, the wait time is real. If you can do takeout, do it. If you can wait, then do that too."
Sugo	4	2020-03-18	"Giant portion sizes, affordable, a great environment. Came here on a regular weekday night and it was packed. We waited a solid hour before being seated. It is definitely a small establishment. Parking is also your typical Toronto city street parking. I was fortunate enough to find residential parking, most of them are by permit only though, so read the signs! 

Food-wise, I ordered the spaghetti with Bolognese sauce. The pasta was cooked to al dente and bolognese was sparsely embedded with meat. The tomato sauce was tart with a dash of basil and a bit of parmesan (mixed in). It was definitely homemade sauce. It wasn't 100% to my liking as I prefer a more sweet taste. I can tell why others would be so intrigued by this dish however. I am interested in trying their rose sauce pasta at my next visit. So yes, I will be returning! Hopefully with a smaller queue next time, but most likely not."
Sugo	4	2020-02-18	"The wait can be brutal especially on the weekends but their service is quick, attentive and super friendly. 
I really enjoyed their sauces on the pasta (but I wish the pasta was homemade, taste like the ones I get on sale at the grocery store). The tomato burrata was a touch too salty, needed more bread to absorb the salt. Tiramisu was creamy and delicious! Mmm I'll be back!"
Sugo	4	2020-01-24	"Dropped by Sugo on the west end for some late dinner on a Thursday night. We got there just after 8 but it was still super busy! We had to wait an hour to get a table. However, there is a thrift store nearby so we went and walked around there until the table was ready. 

The food arrived super quickly after we ordered which was really nice. We got the spaghetti and meatballs plate, as well as the rigatoni and garden salad. They do shares plates for $3 off, and I believe its around the same portion as a regular plate. Each plate came up to around $20. The portions are huge!! I think the bolognese spaghetti size is larger than the rose rigatoni just because of the pasta difference but they were both amazing! They also have a lot of sauce at the bottom which I love. I also really liked the meatball which was really big. I feel like there could be more herbs in the dishes but that's also my personal preference. The garden salad had a lot of dressing but it was a pretty good size. We had enough leftover for two takeout boxes for lunch the next day.

The service here is so sweet! They are very welcoming and accommodating with everything. I would recommend coming early to avoid the wait. It is a small restaurant, but I do like how cozy again. I would come back if I'm in the area, also to try the tiramisu!"
Sugo	5	2020-01-18	"Love this place. Food is delicious. I had burger and it was amazing... They are realy using quilty ingredients. Menu is full of good Italian food. I don't know the name of the chef but kudos to him what ever he does. The only I wish that is bigger space and also more parking availability. Sugo is located on busy Bloor Street West. Prices are right. My wife had pasta and she was impress. The portions are big. Enterier is cozy decorated but tables are small so there is no to much space to enjoy. If you wanna use this place for takeout I think is better option. They are always busy so you have to give some extra time to yourself before actually  get seated. Overall nice experience and for sure we are coming back again. 
I wish they have more choice of burger buns for some people who doesn't eat sesame."
Sugo	2	2020-03-09	This place is overhyped.... the food was quite mediocre however the line was out the door the entire time we were there. We tried the Spaghetti & Meatballs and the Chicken Parmesan Sandwich. The meatball was delicious. However the rest was forgettable.
Sugo	3	2019-11-27	"This place was really busy on a weekday afternoon (3pm), if you come after 4, there will be a bit of a wait. Customer service is great here, the staff are very friendly. 
I had the giant meatball which was delicious although the sauce it came in was a bit too salty. The spaghetti was good (cooked al dente) and the portion size is huge. The best part of the meal was the tiramisu - it was creamy, decadent and chocolaty, get the tiramisu if you come to Sugo!"
Sugo	4	2019-10-08	"If you are a pasta-lover then you've definitely heard of Sugo! I heard and seen of Sugo plenty on social media and knew this spot definitely belongs on my bucketlist. I stopped by around 1 PM on a Saturday and waited about 20 minutes for a table for 2. It is a small restaurant with very cozy and homey vibes, and surprisingly there was plenty of street parking available along Bloor St around this time. 

I decided to go with the spaghetti and meatballs, and my friend went with the rigatoni with calamari for our appetizer. The calamari was perfectly crispy, and the two sauces provided complimented it very well. The two pasta dishes were pretty good but standard - it wasn't THE BEST we've ever had. The meatball with my spaghetti stood out the most, it was very juicy, tender and flavourful. The food were definitely worth the 20 minutes wait but absolutely not worth 2 hours wait time like some of the other reviews mentioned here. Their generous portion and aesthetics are probably what attracts most of the customers here at first... it is what attracted me, anyway!

The service at Sugo is definitely one of the top. We were always notified with wait times and offered drinks while we waited, and our server explained the menu and how everything worked at their establishment very well. Our food arrived just a bit slow but we were warned of that right after as we ordered so it is no biggie. Although, we felt a bit rushed in the end. My friend and I stopped eating for not even 2 minutes and we were given take out boxes and the bill already LMAO would've been nice if we had some more time to settle in with the food... 

I'd definitely come back for their pasta, but not during their rush hour where wait time is a couple hours. I'd recommend Sugo for a cute lunch date/spot, the best atmosphere for it!!"
Sugo	5	2019-09-01	"Lets just say... it's defs the worth! When we first got there on a tuesday night we honestly didn't think it was that busy, since there was only a few people outside waiting. Oh man, we were wrong! When we inside to put our name on the list, ends up there was a 3 page waiting list & almost a 2 hour wait (currently 7:30ish). We went out for a bit then, realized they did take out. So instead of waiting the 2 hours, we ended up waiting 30mins & sat across the street on the bench - and well, though it wasn't ideal the food defs made up for it! Also, everything was fairly priced!! 

We got the mozzarella sticks, meatballs, pepper poppers, calamari & half pasta and half salad - and none of the food disappointed!! The mozzarella sticks had the cheesy pull, meatballs were soft and the sauce went perfect with it. As for the calamari, it was soft and perfectly salted!! The pasta and salad - if you get together you save $3, both were delicious and i would say probably one of my favourite caesar salads. 

Though we didn't get a chance to dine in, we were really impressed with the food and we would defs come back!!"
Sugo	5	2020-01-18	Worth the wait! My friend has been telling me about this place for a while and I have been following Sugo's insta for a while now. So I was super happy to finally have visited this place. It is a small establishment so we had to wait almost 2 hours but once we sat down, it was easy to forget the wait. I loved the energy of the place and the staff were super friendly. You leave your number with the staff and they will call you when the table is ready. The portions here are very generous and  the spaghetti sauce is soooooo good. Everything we had from apps to mains were delicious. We also tried the tiramisu and hazelnut gelato which I also recommend. Overall, 5/5 experience and I guarantee you will most likely have leftovers for the next day to relive the deliciousness!!
Sugo	4	2019-10-20	"So I kept reading the veal sandwich was the 'real' deal and not being Italian, I thought m, ""what does that mean?"" I've had plenty of veal sandwiches so how was this one different?
So the veal is thicker and reminded of a steak sandwich. Plus there was more than 1 layer of it! Bonus not skimpy on the meat. Third, the breading was barely noticeable. So you're not eating a ton of batter.
It's $13 for veal, sauce and cheese with 50 cents for every extra. I got mushrooms and peppers.
Very filling. Now I know."
Sugo	5	2019-08-06	"After a 2 hour wait time, we sat down for a carb heavy meal and every bite was delicious! 

My BF bet his friends they couldn't finish a meal on their own (both of them did.)  haha We shared a meal between us and were both FULL. Great value if you don't bet your friends and end up paying for the whole table Haha!

Blasting music and wine flowing it made for a fun atmosphere!  We'll be back! :) 

We did the Veal Parm & Spaghetti  Apparently it's all homemade."
Sugo	5	2020-02-11	"I was in the mood for some comforting Italian food. So happy to have chosen Sugo. 
Caesar salad was on point. Calamari was tender and savory. Veal Parmigiana sandwich was delicious. 
We also had the eggplant parmigiana that was equally delicious. To finish we had the cannoli and espresso. 
You won't be disappointed- worth the wait."
Sugo	5	2020-01-20	"Went on a Monday, came right at opening and they quickly filled up to full house of happy diners within the hour. Having finally experienced the hype, can safely say it's worth it! There's the option of doing a 50/50 split platter if you're indecisive like me, which two of us ordered a veal parm/gnocchi platter and their burrata to share. Burrata was on a bruschetta based, thick cut of garlic-y bread with all that cheese  The veal parm was tender and coated with mozz, gnocchi was fresh and soft, along with the Aperol spritz - such a good meal 
."
Sugo	5	2019-07-10	"My hometown is full of expensive Italian restaurants, and recently I went to an underwhelming one in the outskirts of Toronto. But after my visit to Sugo I left painfully full, satisfied, and itching to go back. Great food does not need to cost an arm and a leg.

We went in for lunch in this small and welcoming restaurant, with us in a line against the wall as we wait our turn for our feast. We were quickly given the bar seating along the perimeter.

Our waiter was snappy, funny, casual, and informative. Real cool guy that gave us everything we need to make a solid decision on what to order. That decision was... to order as much as possible.

We ordered the spaghetti, gnocci, rigatoni, and deli sandwich along with chicken parm and meatballs. My main dish with the chicken parm was excellent, with the chicken juicy and well cooked. I COULD NOT GET ENOUGH OF THE GNOCCI. That sharp, zesty sauce really complimented all those soft dough meatballs, mozzarella cheese, and chicken. Also, I love how each pasta has it's own dedicated sauce. The spicy pink sauce with the rigatoni was my second favorite; I'll probably go that way with a veal parm next!

Thanks Sugo for the great experience, my friends and I will be back soon! #werenotfromnyc"
Trattoria Nervosa	4	2020-02-08	"Came here with a craving for something creamy and truffle-based. Lucky for me, I scoped the restaurant ahead of time and was completely entranced by others' photos of their Mafalde ai Funghi ($23). 

Cutting straight to the chase, the pasta was everything I wanted and needed it to be. It was delicious, creamy, earthy.. yum.. it hit just the spot! Portions were fair, especially since cream sauce pastas are so heavy, but I did find myself wanting some more protein in my meal and ended up sharing an order of mussels with my partner.

Although on the more expensive side, I have yet to find myself a better creamy truffle pasta so I guess I'll just have to take the hit whenever I crave this dish! (But if you know of a better place, please do hit me up in my messages!)"
Trattoria Nervosa	4	2020-02-08	"First I'd like the customers to know, the chefs who work here are not Italian! so for those picky eaters who expect nonas food and that authentic taste I wouldnt recommend eating here. 

I have been eating here for the last 10 years, over the years I started to know the waiter's waitress and the chefs and they all have 1 thing in common and that's great customer service but unfortunately over the years I did notice a drastic change in the dinning in experience. 

The restaurant has got really busy where at times you'll have to wait just to dine-in and even if you do decide to wait to dine-in the restaurant is SMALL and it being over crowded, barely any room to move you'll feel over welmed!

Depending who's on shift some waitresses will try to rush you to order and leave (since they are that busy) the experience of dinning in has declined. I do not recommend dinning in.

I have stopped dinning in for the last 5 years, i have been using Ubereats or just walking down the street to pick up my order. 

The Calamarata Con Gameria is what has me being a loyal customer, the chefs have made my gameri perfect everytime over the years. I personally have never had the desire to try something else off there menu. I have been busy enjoying my Calamarata Con Gameri :) I highly recommend trying. 

***************************************
1 change I didnt like is the to-go brown boxes, for the money I spend I prefer the black containers they used before!"
Trattoria Nervosa	3	2020-01-11	"A very popular Italian restaurant, but didn't quite live up to the hype.

We came on a hot summer day and it was very crowded. We ended up getting a seat upstairs outside on the balcony, but it was very crowded--both in terms of people and seating space.
The seats were pretty minuscule and packed together. There was barely enough space for us to squeeze between the tables to sit down on the outer seats--despite being on the thinner side myself. My other friends, who chose to sit on the inner side, would definitely not be able to squeeze into the outer seats because they are tall men who also hit the gym--their extra pound of muscles already cut them from sitting here, so I can only imagine the types of people who are regular patrons. 

We got the calamaratato con gamberi, mafalde al funghi, rigatoni bologanese, and risotto nervosa.
The server recommended the calamaratato con gamberi since it was a popular dish with some spiciness, but it was quite lackluster. The dish wasn't spicy at all, granted we're quite accustomed to spicy foods. 
The mafalde al funghi was delicious and creamy with a full bodied flavour. 
The rigatoni bologanese was a very typical pasta that tasted like a deconstructed lasagna--which isn't a bad thing. It felt too commonplace and lackluster for this price point though.
The risotto nervosa was probably the star of the show. The risotto is amazing and creamy and the braised beef pairs well with it. Though I will admit that the beef, when eaten on its own, felt a little dry. 

Perhaps it's because I'm more accustomed to Asian food, but this restaurant felt quite underwhelming and overpriced.
Many of the dishes didn't stand out too much and is quite comparable to what you would find at much lower price points or even store bought. Don't get me wrong, the food was good, but perhaps not worthy of a second visit."
Trattoria Nervosa	5	2019-12-11	"Second visit (first one being years back) but this was just having pizzas. Definitely returning to have other hot menu items.

Tried both the Classica and Prosciutto E Rucola. Loved both but if I had to choose, Classica was my favourite (maybe because I'm a huge fan of sopressata)."
Trattoria Nervosa	2	2020-05-15	"My boyfriend and I used to go to Trattoria Nervosa all the time, it closed down a couple of times for ""renovations"" so we havent been in a while. We just ordered from them after they opened up post-COVID era and were supremely disappointed with the food. The prices stayed the same but the portions were significantly smaller and the crust for the pizza wasnt as good as it used to be. You used to be able to smell truffles when you walked in the restaurant, I couldnt even taste them at all on the pizza. They also got rid of the beef carpaccio and the risotto nervosa which were a couple of our favourite dishes! :("
Trattoria Nervosa	2	2019-11-11	"Unfortunately they did not let us make reservations probably because of the small size of the restaurant. 

I had a really uncomfortable time at this restaurant... let me tell you why...

The seating arrangement of the tables was very poor. 

We were seated on the second floor at a small table. There was another table, located one foot away from us, between us and the wall/window. Directly behind my friends seat was another table, so when she sat down, her chair was almost touching this other table. Directly behind my chair was someone else's chair. We were squished!!

When I sat down my chair was back to back with their chair. There was no room for the people in the table at the window to get out and for the servers to get over to them, so my friend and I had to stand up and tuck our chair in to let them through. When another couple came and sat there, I also had to stand up again and push my chair in to let them through. This was incredibly uncomfortable. 

A restaurant is supposed to be a relaxing place, especially when you are spending hard working money. I shouldn't be standing up and needing to let people through time and time again.

When serving the table behind me, the server had to squeeze behind my chair and stand right against the back and the side of my chair. It was not a relaxing dining experience at all! Service was okay at best, when they weren't getting me to stand up or squish us.

I ordered the malfalde ai fungi, it tasted delicious for the first few bites but the cream was so rich it was difficult to finish and I felt a little nauseous at the end. 

I expected much better!"
Trattoria Nervosa	5	2019-10-22	"I was on the hunt for good Italian food in Yorkville that wasn't ridiculously overpriced. Upon recommendation and the great online reviews, a girlfriend and I decided to go with Nervosa, and I'm sooo happy we did. 

The food was amazing! I went with the Calamarata Con Gamberi dish which was to die for. It included ""wild shrimp, tomato sauce, cherry tomato, chillies, marjoram and parsley."" It was spicy but had just the right amount without overdoing it. My friend went with the Mafalde Al Funghi which is one of the pasta dishes that Nervosa is well known for. This dish included ""portobello, porcini, crimini, oyster mushrooms, parmigiano, truffle paste and light cream sauce."" I also got a bite of hers and despite hating mushroom, it was delicious. We also got the Bruschetta Al Funghi, which again included mushrooms but was nonetheless tasty. I've actually never had bruschetta prepared with mushrooms replaced by tomatoes, but I'd order it again. 

To drink we got the Must Be Nice & Diablo cocktails, both of which were so good. None overly sweet which is usually my number one issue with cocktails. 

The service was superb! All the waiters that served us were friendly and attentive. Our food took probably a bit over 10 minutes to come which was great, considering the restaurant was packed and it was a Saturday night. Even the wait to be seated initially went by fast. 

I will hands down be back! I absolutely loved it here!"
Trattoria Nervosa	4	2019-09-30	"As much as I dislike the Yorkville neighborhood and its army of pretentious patrons, I can't say a bad word about Trattoria Nervosa. 

In fact, we have been coming here once a year (usually in the summer) for about 3 years now and have enjoyed it every time.  

Space isn't plentiful at Trattoria Nervosa but they make good use of what they have (despite frequently being at capacity).  The seating is a bit cozy but it does not feel too snug or crowded.  The upstairs dining room gets a ton of natural light and feels a lot bigger than it actually is.

The service is excellent.  The waitstaff are professional, quick and knowledgeable about the menu.  

The food is always excellent.  They have an extensive menu but we usually order one of their rich decadent pastas and thin crust pizzas.  Everything is made fresh and has the right amount of flavor.  

For dessert, I recommend the pistachio cannoli (for which there is always room)."
Trattoria Nervosa	4	2019-09-24	"Great service, great food and very European on flavour/style (including the tight seating :).

We shared a few pizzas as appetizers which were delicious!  Oven baked with thin crusts-we really enjoyed it!

The main courses of lamb and bass were both perfectly prepared and tasted great.  The lamb was a little bit small in portion size.

This Italian restaurant in Yorkville is a must try.

The only downside is the price...it's not cheap, but is anything in Yorkville cheap"
Trattoria Nervosa	5	2019-12-05	A hidden little gem!!!! Great Italian Restaurant in the Yorkville area.  When I say little gem I mean little.  It's not very big but the flavors are LARGE.  We came early for lunch.  We where promptly seated.  Ordered sparkling water and a carafe of white wine.  Ordered the calamarata con gamberi - wild shrimp, tomato sauce, cherry tomato, chillies - AMAZING.  Husband got the rigatoni with bolognese sauce.  Delicious.  Finish our lunch with dessert - tiramisu this was creamy, slightly sweet and the best I've ever had.  *Note- come early  as we where eating lunch the place filled up pretty fast.  By the time we left there where people waiting outside waiting outside to get it.
Trattoria Nervosa	4	2019-04-05	"Love this cozy, Italian place in yorkville. They don't make resos and there's usually a bit of a wait so try not to come hungry because it's worth the wait. In the summer their patio is lovely. 

For drinks, their sangria is amazing I order it every time I go. Usually get some bread for the table, downside is that it's not complimentary but tastes great with their olive oil. My go-to at any Italian restaurant is always pasta and their mafalde e funghi is top-notch! But I've also enjoyed their kale salad and capalleni with tomatoes and goat cheese. A bit pricey for what it is, but not bad compared to Yorkville standards. Definitely recommend it."
Trattoria Nervosa	4	2019-07-11	"I have eaten here twice, several weeks apart and on both occasion I found the food to be near impeccable. The octopus appetizer was amazing, as was the beef short ribs & mushroom risotto. In fact, I found the risotto to be almost on par in standards to the best risotto meals I've had in Venice. And that is truly rare!

The pizza with nudja is also quite a unique offering not commonly found in pizzerias here in Canada. I would have liked the crust a bit more charred and the dough a bit more chewy. The pizzas were the only items on the menu that I felt were over-priced.

I would return, no doubt about it. If there is any criticism at all, it's the seating arrangements. You feel like you are sardines in a can sitting almost shoulder to shoulder!"
Trattoria Nervosa	4	2018-12-12	"Delicious and authentic Italian food in Yorkville. I came for a weekday lunch and the restaurant was bustling with business by noon time. Sadly they don't take reservations here, so come early or prepare to wait a bit for a table.

I ordered the Mafalde al Funghi and as a truffle lover, I absolutely LOVED this dish and would order it again in a heartbeat (despite so many other appealing dishes on the menu!). The dish is deliciously aromatic, creamy, and rich in mushroom flavor. The ribbon-like pasta shape is also eye-catching, making the dish appear more appetizing and more unique than your typical pasta dish.

Seating was a bit tight and the restaurant got pretty loud once the lunch crowd came in, but it was still a fantastic meal overall."
Trattoria Nervosa	4	2019-06-25	"**atmosphere & service 5/5 came by for lunch, sat on the patio. service was ok. the inside 2nd fl is really cute! 

**overall food 4/5 

asiago al forno 4/5 wished we got more croustini because the cheese portion was a lot compared to the croustini. it was really good! gooey baked asiago cheese w.herbs & garlic.

mafalde ai funghi 4/5
pasta itself was too al dente for my liking. i dont like hard chewy pasta stuck to my molars. but flavours were amazing! creamy, cheesy & lots of assorted mushrooms! mmm! 

risotto nervosa 3/5
the risotto was good! made w.assorted mushrooms. the short rib was too dry. a little gravy or sauce wouldve helped.  

nduja pizza 4/5
crust was amazing! thin & chewy. sauce was simple & perfectly seasoned. roasted peppers, smoked provolone nduja (sausage) crumbles and fior de latte cheese! just a tad salty over all. 

definitely coming back here to check out their other pastas & pizzas!"
Trattoria Nervosa	4	2019-05-18	This was a follow up trip to this eatery. I quite enjoyed their pasta dish on a last minute take out and vowed to come back. This trip was for an early dinner. I didn't realise they had seating upstairs with a mini patio which is sure to please for people watching.  I had the margherita pizza on this visit. The service is ok for what it is. On to the pizza, a decent take on it and go toe to toe with the local multi location restaurants. The crust was decent and so was the sauce. I was slightly more impressed with their pasta dish though so check and check. I will be back to try out other stuff.
Trattoria Nervosa	5	2018-11-20	"Amazing food, amazing service!

First time I went for their famous funghi pasta, so tasty and the portion has a good size!
While I was waiting for my pasta, I saw some pizzas and it was looking so good.
I'm not a big fan of pizza (I know, weird hahaha), but the next time I went there I needed to try it for sure.
I ordered the ""Prosciutto e Rucola"" pizza, I finished the whole pizza!!!! Light but filling, crunchy crust and fresh ingredients! I asked for more Parmesan and there he came with lots of it, loved!

For dessert I got the cannoli, it comes 2 pieces, and soooooo good! Full of pistachios on top, it was delicious.

Our server was David, such a kind and fun guy, thanks man! :)"
Trattoria Nervosa	4	2019-12-18	Their mafalde ai fungi pasta is delicious (although heavy). Their wine selection is pretty good, service is decently quick. It's a great restaurant that brings in a diverse crowd. Although I didn't eat it, their pizza looks good too. Overall, great option to eat Italian in Yorkville!
Trattoria Nervosa	4	2019-05-22	"TL;DR Decent Italian food with fresh ingredients, good price for Yorkville

Came on a Saturday at lunch, no wait for walk-in, shared 2 dishes as we weren't hungry. 

Kale salad 4.5/5 - Possibly one the best kale salads we've ever had. Comes with finely chopped kale soaked in vinaigrette. The combination of dried berries and pine nuts is what made this dish so tasty. Highly recommend

Branzino 4/5 the fish itself was tender and beautifully made. The green sauce of herbs and lemon is also delicious. The issue was that not enough salt or acid was in the dish, thus was lacking flavour."
Trattoria Nervosa	3	2019-03-24	"This is a very cute restaurant in the heart of Yorkville on the corner of Yorkville Avenue. 

Like most of the reviewers, I went for the popular dish, Malafalde di Funghi. This pasta dish tasted as good as it looked. It's creamy and the pasta was al denté. 

We sat on the main floor, which was buzzing on Friday afternoon. Next time, I'd like to check out the rooftop patio when the weather is nicer. 

The price is mid to higher end, which I'm not crazy about. And after reading other people's reviews, the taste for other highlighted dishes seemed more conflicted (less consensus -except for the dish I got), so this wouldn't be a go-to spot for me. 

Atmosphere is on point. It's not stuffy like most of the restaurants in Yorkville. It feels homey.

The server we had was super busy, but he did what he needed to do. He was very on point with pouring our champagne and always made sure our glasses were filled. 

Overall, it was a pleasant experience."
Trattoria Nervosa	2	2019-10-20	We came here today to have her usual Sunday family dinner. However, we found her self with a very poor service, unfriendly waiter, cold food and very plain flavors. The place is very cozy, Nevertheless I would not recommend this place.
Enoteca Sociale	5	2019-12-17	I was here over the weekend for a romantic dinner. The staff are lovely and the service was great. Amazing dishes, I highly recommend building your own charcuterie board. It's intimate and candlelit. When I made my reservation, they were very accommodating and replied quickly with answers to my questions.
Enoteca Sociale	3	2019-08-01	"It's become increasingly clear that ambiance plays almost as big a role in my enjoyment of a meal as the food itself, and this concept was certainly illustrated in spades during my time at Enoteca Sociale.

We arrived around 6:00 on a weekday, and though we didn't have a reservation, we were immediately shown to a table on the patio.

It's a nice patio, admittedly, but there are definitely some problems. The biggest and most obvious issue is the lack of space between the tables. We were sitting between two other tables and there was probably only a few inches separating us and our neighbors. It was less than private, to put it mildly.

We were also sitting underneath some trees and there was some sap or something that kept falling. The diners to our left actually wound up moving because of it, and my dining companion wound up with some gross-looking stuff on her shirt.

It's not exactly an atmosphere conducive to enjoying a quiet, romantic meal, is my point.

Anyway, in terms of the food, Enoteca Sociale is definitely an above-average destination. We were presented with some complimentary bread to snack on, and it was delicious. The bread was fresh and tasty, while the accompanying oil contained a smokiness that I found irresistible.

For my main, I went with the Amatriciana (""Guanciale, tomato, Pecorino Romano & chili""), and aside from the fact that it's an almost comically small portion (I think I ate the whole thing in about two minutes), this is definitely a top-notch bowl of pasta. The tomato sauce contains exactly the sort of deep richness that one covets, while the pasta itself was cooked quite well. The concoction could've been hotter (i.e. it was probably sitting for a few minutes before I got it), but otherwise I really dug the heck out of this.

It's just too bad about that ambiance."
Enoteca Sociale	3	2019-05-09	"Enoteca is a nice spot with great drinks and great vibe to grab a bite and hang out with friends. I've driven by Enoteca a number of times and finally had the time to go check this place out. Located just west of Dundas and Dovercourt, you can't miss the massive doors. 

Service was great from start to finish, attentive and overall a good experience. However, the food was decent at best. The Cacio e Pepe was on the saltier side, so be ready for that. It was very rich in flavour, a pinch less of salt and this would be been wonderful. The charcuterie board was decent, although I must say that the cheese was really good. 

Best dish of the night goes to the arancini balls. Really nice and crispy on the outside, stringy and warm cheese on the inside. Drench it in the tomato sauce, you won't regret it."
Enoteca Sociale	4	2018-12-10	"This place is always such a treat! Super warm and casual spot with delicious Italian fare and great service. On our most recent visit, we had their chicken liver mousse, arancini, salmon crudo, squid ink pasta and the amatriciana. All delicious. We also really enjoyed the olive oil that they serve with their complimentary bread.

If you've never been, you honestly cannot go wrong with their pasta dishes. Freshly made pasta and perfectly al dente with great flavors.

Definitely make reservations in advance, especially if you want to go on a weekend."
Enoteca Sociale	4	2019-04-25	"This may sound snobbish - but when I go to a new Italian spot, and I want to test to see if it is good, I will order the simplest thing on the menu. 

Pasta with a tomato based sauce. No major entree. Just an appitezer, and a pasta.

To start - we ordered a prosciutto, a raw cow cheese, a raw goat cheese. Initially thought it was a bit pricey, but the charcuterie board came with pickled peppers/cauliflower, green apple slices (sliced beautifully thin), roasted spicey pecans, and a small bowl of honey. It was very good. The raw goat cheese was my favorite. 

I ordered the Amatriciana - it was very simple, delicious and had a nice bite to it spice wise. I loved it.

We also ordered Cacio e Pepe - which I've never been a fan of because I was find this dish too salty. 

Overall - place was great. A bit pricy, but the food is delicious."
Enoteca Sociale	5	2019-04-06	Great place with such a cozy ambiance! We sat at the bar and enjoyed some of the best ribeye steak I ever had! My husband got the Caccio e Peppe! The ribeye was seasoned perfectly and the salad that came with us was perfect! I wish I was staying in Toronto long enough to eat here again!
Enoteca Sociale	5	2019-10-12	I had this place in my list for a long time and we finally visited during the summer. They have a beautiful patio! We tried Arranchini for appetizers and just loved it... We also have two vegetarian pastas, which were good. the portion sizes were small however the quality of food was rich.
Enoteca Sociale	4	2019-03-23	Been meaning to try this place. Finally did for an anniversary with the girlfriend. Got the seafood pasta, vitello tonnato, gnocchi and the amatriciana. All delicious! Paired all that with a (their last) bottle of Barolo Docg 2012 which was great! Nice ambience and our waiter was very pleesant!
Enoteca Sociale	4	2018-11-04	"Our decision to come here was pretty last minute and we weren't able to make a reservation online because all the times were full (Saturday evening), so we decided to go early. We got there at 5:00pm, right when they opened, and we were seated immediately. 

The service was great, as it was actually pretty quiet in the beginning. We were given complimentary warm rosemary bread to start, which we devoured immediately. They even gave us a refill of the bread which is 10/10 service in my books because I love carbs. 

We ordered the beef crudo ($15) to start. This was probably my favourite part of the meal. The beef and tomatoes were seasoned perfectly and paired with a crunchy flatbread. I would highly recommend this as a shared starter! 

I got the gnocchi ($15). The sauce was delicious and they gave me a huge slather of ricotta on top, which I very much appreciated. The gnocchi was alright, the texture wasn't as chewy as I'd hoped it would be. It was a little soft and mushy, more potato-y than pasta-y. It wasn't bad, but I would've preferred if it was a little firmer. 

I didn't get to try the cacio e pepe ($13), but my boyfriend really enjoyed it and said it was delicious. 

I was impressed by the low prices when I first looked at the menu, but the portions were a little smaller than average, so I'd say the prices were fair."
Enoteca Sociale	4	2018-03-26	"This has been on my Food List for almost 2 years (if you don't have a food list, get your priorities straight). I went after spending a week in the Bahamas and I was really looking forward to some good pasta. Let's get one thing out of the way, service was great - I had at least 3 different servers pouring water, bringing over fresh bread and removing plates. 

Moving on to the Pasta, we ordered 2 pasta dishes. The Cacio e Pepe & the Amatriciana. Now I know authentic pasta is supposed to be served Al Dente but this was taken to a whole other level, almost to a pain where I thought they may have undercooked it. That's what I didn't like, if it was cooked a bit more then I would have enjoyed it a bit more. That's just personal preference though. 

What I liked was the simplicity of the dishes. The Cacio e Pepe was made with sheep's milk cheese and black pepper. Super simple, not too creamy or cheesy - really good. The Amatriciana has chili, tomato and some sort of bacon. Really simple. I actually combined the 2 of them and the Cacio really balanced out the tomato in the Amatriciana. 

We obviously ordered dessert which was a Sticky Toffee Pudding with Ice Cream. It was very rich and sweet. I could only do 1-2 bites, because it was a bit overwhelming for me. 

I would love to check out the cheese cave they have downstairs, and the cute little party room. 


Keep Eating,

Enoteca Sociale	4	2018-12-24	"I've heard tons about Enoteca Sociale on my journey to find some of the best Italian food in the city, and it definitely didn't disappoint.

The menu offers several items that you most likely won't find across other Italian restaurants in the city, so it provides a unique experience to say the least.

Our table tried 2 dishes, the Beef Crudo appetizer, and the Cacio e Pepe Paste. The Beef Crudo was a surprise for our table. Neither of us really eat raw meat - but we went out on a limb to try something new and it didn't disappoint! The beef had a great peppery and citrusy flavour, without being gamey at all - which was fear for us! It was a great appetizer to start and to snack on over discussion.

We then had the Cacio e Pepe that's been raved all over Yelp, however I feel like it left me wanting more. I know that the dish is supposed to be simple and made of limited ingredients, but I felt like I was looking for something a extra to push the flavour profile over the edge.

The service was impeccable as we sat at the bar, our server was always very attentive and helpful. Would come back again to try the other options on the menu!"
Enoteca Sociale	5	2019-05-23	"This place is probably a 4.5, but I'm rounding-up because I think this place needs some love from the 4 stars it currently has. 

I was flying solo and grabbed a seat at the bar, and the bartender was really helpful. Although solo, I could tell this was wonderful date restaurant as it was rather intimate. But fret not, even though I was solo, the restaurant wasn't that 'date-y' and it was lively and social(e) so it's still good for small groups. 

I only ordered 2 small plates to get a sense of the restaurant, and I was really impressed. I ordered the arancini and the rapini, and both were delicious. 

The arancini was one of the better ones I've had and that's saying something, because I have had some delicious arancini. The ones served at Enoteca Sociale had great texture, and wonderful combination of the crunchy outer crust and the soft cheese and rice inside were perfect. It was a perfect ratio of rice, cheese, and fried breading. 

The rapini was also very flavorful and had a nice level of oil and acid. They keep it in long strips and so it was rather difficult to cut with a butter knife, but that was the only drawback of 2 delicious dishes. 

Although a small sampling, I was impressed and definitely want to get back to try some of their main dishes and entrees. I can't speak to those dishes, but I can point you in the direction of some of their starters. Definitely recommend those dishes!"
Enoteca Sociale	5	2020-03-08	We returned after a few years.  Our experience was exceptional and better than we remember from last time. No reservations were required, We got a seat at the bar.  Food and service was brilliant.
Enoteca Sociale	3	2017-10-27	"This was in a quieter area. The restaurant was really empty when I came on a weekday. They have a small patio area that is facing a small street. We were seated immediately but no one gave us the menus until 5 minutes later. The service was really slow despite the fact that it was early in the evening without many customers. I noticed they were training some employees that day, so only a few were serving the entire restaurant.

Appetizers: Me and my friends tried a few appetizers and we loved every single one of them.The arancini was great, it was so cheesy and the tomato sauce packed enough flavor. My favorite appetizer is definitely the chicken liver mousse though. The mousse was very flavorful and so smooth. The jelly with the mousse added a nice touch. Next best appetizer is the beef crudo. The aioli served with the beef crudo was amazing, and the beef crudo tasted so fresh overall. I say the chicken liver mousse and the beef crudo are a MUST GET here! 

Mains: The pasta we ordered was SOO SALTY! My group kept waving our server for more water. I hope all their pasta isn't like this, it could be the particular one we got. But the pasta was disappointing. The noodles were cooked nicely, but the sauce was just too salty. We also ordered a side dish of green beans which were alright.

In conclusion, I love the food here. The prices are decent. But I would probably stay away from the pasta that we got this time. Perhaps I will try another pasta next time. The service was slow and my table didn't get much attention from our server. I would have rated it higher if there was better service."
Enoteca Sociale	4	2018-05-30	Enoteca Sociale is famous for their fresh pastas, and now I finally know why. Their SOFT gnocchi was simply divine with tomato, chili and smoked ricotta. Who can say no to smoked ricotta?! I always feel like smoked cheese tastes like meat and it worked so well with the gnocchi. I will definitely be back to try more of their pastas!
Enoteca Sociale	2	2019-07-27	I came here and had a short male server with a buzz cut and glasses that was very rude.
Enoteca Sociale	5	2019-11-16	"One word. FANTASTIC. Came in with no reservation for 2. Immediately the host/ front of house squad accommodated me and got me seated within 2-mins (I was fully prepared to wait for a table). Me and the birthday boy were both first timers - our server had excellent recommendations and he even brought us complimentary olives (WE LOVED THE OLIVES AND BREAD)!!! Ordered off the 3 for 22, the meat portions were GENEROUS... we just came back from Italy in October and felt like we were in Rome again. Some places in TO don't serve portions like that (don't want to say any names - but you know king W isn't your friend). Anyways, carried on and ordered 2 pasta dishes to share the duck and the amatriciana - both were divine. I think the noodles stole the show, thick, soft, and buttery. We ordered the coffee dessert and our server (tall, beard, soft voice, I think he had red hair?) brought  us a surprised cannoli with a candle - very nice touch to end the evening. Other things I wanted to point out - I LOVED the diverse staff, the interior, the soft candles, the low lights, and the intense/bad ass bread cutting lady! She means business. 

Overall, we will be back. Xx"
Enoteca Sociale	5	2018-01-13	"4.5/5. 

If this place were *slightly* more affordable, I'd give it a perfect score. My friend and I shared the arancini, chicken liver mousse, rapini, and one of the soft cheeses. As my main I got the squid ink bigoli while she had the tagliatelle. We were impressed with all of the appetizers and side dishes, though if I had to quibble the the arancini could've used more salt. Highlight would have to be the chicken liver mousse (::Homer Simpson drool::) My pasta dish was excellent: the mussels and anchovies were fresh and tasty without being overpoweringly ""fishy"", and the breadcrumbs added a very enjoyable crunch. Preserved tomatoes lent just the right notes of sweetness. Also was a fan of the robust Bierno red of which I had two glasses. 

All in all, this is definitely one of the most satisfying dining experiences that you can have in the city without burning a huge hole in your wallet. The servers are friendly and don't hesitate to answer any questions you may have about the menu. The ambiance of the restaurant is also warm and inviting without feeling too staid--probaly the perfect place to bring a date. That exposed brick!"
Enoteca Sociale	5	2017-05-01	"Great place for a date. Romantic/rustic decor and a small menu gives room for care in every dish.

The beef crudo was very fresh, soft, and seasoned wonderfully. 

Very good arancini, hot gooey cheese inside a fine crisp shell.

The gnocchi was incredibly soft, sauce could use a little more oomph though.

The chicken liver pate alone was bitter but saved with the accompanying sweet jam.

We loved the panna cotta with rhubarb compote. It was very smooth and the cream dissolved in the mouth, followed by a rush of flavour from the compote."
Enoteca Sociale	4	2018-01-03	"Almost a full restaurant on a Monday? They must be doing something right!

I came in here with the SO for dinner, and it was lively to say the least! We were seated promptly. The ambience is a lovely combination of rustic with modern elements. 

We ordered a couple of arancini balls, and the trout crudo to start. And a couple of pasta dishes - amatriciana and turkey tagliatelle. 

House bread with olive oil - Just perfect way to start. 
Arancini - Crunchy on the outside, soft and cheesy on the inside with a beautiful tomato sauce. Probably one of the best I've had. 
Trout Crudo - It's a delicate dish! I should have eaten this before the arancini... and saved some bread. oh well...
Amatriciana  and Tagliatelle - Perfectly al dente paired with balanced sauces. If you are craving pasta, you are at the right place. 

The cocktails looked great, but I didn't drink this time. I'll have to make a trip down here again - maybe in the summer for the patio!"
Stelvio	5	2020-02-29	Went on a Saturday afternoon and was one of two pairs there which made me sort of second guess but that went away after I tried the gnocchi. Doesn't matter if it's a packed house or you're the only guests if the food holds up. And the food more than holds up. My brunch buddy got the tagliatelle with mushrooms and raved the entire time. Wish there was better bread with something to dip (oils, etc) but that's my only complaint. Portions don't look big but they are quite filling. It ain't cheap though. Well worth it though.
Stelvio	3	2020-02-14	"meeeeeeh.... I really wasn't all that impressed with this place. 

The decor and service were really good for sure. But the food was just OK. Considering how many amazing Italian restaurants there are in Toronto, I would not come back to this one. 

One thing that really surprised me was that the food was cold and didn't taste fresh. It sort of tasted like it had been reheated. 

The appetizers were fine but not amazing. The risotto, osso buco, and pasta did not live up to the hype -- just imo."
Stelvio	5	2020-02-09	Amazing. Felt like I  was back in northern  Italy. Perfect for those common cold dayS in Toronto where all you want is some comfort food. Perfect because not only it is delicious and comforting, but it won't leave you feeling gross. I had plans too go ever since they were on Queen Street, but then they moved and still made it a point of visiting. Went with a friend who lived in Milan for a while, and she also loved it. we ordered two different kinds and shared it, which I recommend doing since the pasta is heavy and you may want to change up your palate. We ordered the pizzoccheri di teglio and the casoncelli alla bergamasca, and nothing was left on our plates by the end of it. A plus was the adorable deCor that made the restaurant feel cozy yet super elegant. Highly recommend checking out this spot for authentic Northern Italian cuisine!
Stelvio	3	2019-05-25	"First time at Stelvio- wasn't as good as I'd hoped. 

We ordered some fritti mozzarella bites and they were good- but definitely needed a dipping sauce. Or maybe I'm just too used to real mozzeralla sticks with marinara. 
I wouldn't recommend it.

I ordered the pasta special which was a gnocchi with truffle, meat, and porcini. When I first got it I was happy that it came with a lot of truffle, but when I got into it I felt like it had too much. It was definitely too much of a good thing. But it was $28 so I guess they wanted you to feel like you got bang for your buck. 

My bf ordered the tagliatelle ragu and it looked good, but he said the primary flavour was salt. When I tried it- I would have to agree. It was tomato and salt. Not complex at all. 

Also as an aside- I would say the pasta portions are relatively small for the price. You get this dish with a little bowl dent in the middle and your pasta portion is basically the size of a rice bowl. 

I'm happy I tried it but I probably wouldn't come back."
Stelvio	5	2019-10-21	"My son wanted to have Italian food to celebrate his 18th birthday. I looked at different options and decided on Stelvio. I am glad that this was the restaurant I chose. We walked there from Chinatown and it was easy to find. Our waitress was a class act. She spent time explaining the menu and each of the dishes. I was impressed by how knowledgeable she was. 

She told us the menu changes every season. I decided to go with her recommendation of the Pizzoccheri Di Teglio. I found out that this is hard to find in the United States and it's only served in the winter months in Italy. I didn't know what to expect but it was delicious. My dad and son were also happy with their dishes. 

It was a nice time with family while eating delicious food."
Stelvio	3	2018-09-25	"Queen West small Italian shop with simple black and white décor, sizeable patio but limited seating inside, typical (you'll get the joke soon) Italian fair with a slight focus on risottos and pastas.

I thought just the décor was black and white, but it turned out the placemats and menus were also black and white - there's a collection of black ink art that reminds me of medieval times when artists worked for months on a simple line drawing to get things just right - whether it was embellishment in a single capital letter, or a decorative flower, or the skull of an animal - because you know, all these are completely related and belong side by side. Nothing wrong with it at all, it was definitely unique and presented artfully. 

The menu is deceptively lengthy - dishes are in Italian then described in English. I've never read a menu that uses ""typical"" as it's adjective of choice so much. Most of my party went for pastas - they were smaller portions than desired. It would've been fine as a lunch portion, but for dinner it was insufficient and taste was simpler than expected (or should I say, typical?). The risotto with veal was actually a highlight despite some other reviews and the portion was actually filling, unlike the gnocchi and ravioli items (those were the smallest!). Overall it was really not bad - but unfortunately underwhelming.

Service is very slow if you're a large group - so please spare them and only come with a few friends. You'll enjoy the ambiance more and sharing more items will be more feasible, and your overall experience will just be that much better! If I'm in the area I suppose I could give it another shot, but for one that values taste over aesthetic, I might not be back."
Stelvio	3	2018-09-26	"This small restaurant isn't a place I would have chosen myself but was suggested to me by a local Torontonian. Stelvio has a location in Toronto as well as in Milan, so my expectations were set really high. The service was great but honestly the food didn't meet my expectations. 
Being a vegetarian my options were limited, so I went with the mushroom risotto. By the time it got to my table it was cold, likely because of the way they plate it; a thin layer of risotto in a large bowl, almost looks like a porridge. 
My colleagues went with the prosciutto and beef wrapped around a thick wooden dowel, which came with polenta fries and looked rather unique, they seemed to enjoy it. 
Wines are all on the pricey side... amarone starts at $185...
All in all I was expecting more."
Stelvio	5	2018-10-28	"Really delicious and hearty food.

The stavroz are a must to try at least once. Great portion to share with one more person (or two). 

The gnocchi was so tender and soft and pillowy, and the pomedoro sauce was a great addition!

The veal was also oh sooo tender! 

I'd for sure go back to try a few more different meals there!"
Stelvio	2	2020-03-06	"Pro
Atmospheric, though nothing particularly unique 

Con
Reached out to their e-mail and never heard back
Very underwhelming service - no plates were offered when they came out with bread, difficult to get the attention of the server, had to repeatedly ask for water refills 
Small portions"
Stelvio	3	2018-03-23	"Hovering between 3 and 4 stars. The food was delicious to be sure, but the price point was extremely high for the portions we received. I realized the pasta is made in house so that accounts for a lot of it, but it still just felt pretty pricey given we didn't really order that much and got pretty hungry again a few hours later.

My husband ordered the ravioli (8 small ravioli in dish. It was FANTASTIC but a tiny portion) and I had the mushroom tagliatelle (also great but just mushrooms tossed in a light sauce with a bit of parsley). We also split the chocolate cake for dessert and I had a glass of wine and the whole tab came out to around $70. WHAT. The night before we ate at another restaurant with dishes packed with seafood, veggies, meat, and more and we spent the same amount of money for around 8-9 small plates of food. And everything was made from scratch there as well. 

The experience was nice, and the food was good but I would probably not return given you can get more for your money in Toronto at other locations and have an equally delicious meal."
Stelvio	5	2019-04-17	Finally tried Stelvio on Saturday night and they did not disappoint! I also found out they're moving to Dundas west pretty soon so I'm glad we caught them while they were still on queen! Food and service was phenomenal. We got the bread which came with olives and a meat and cheese charcuterie to start. All delicious. I drank aperol spritz which was also very good. For mains I got the polenta with sausage and mushrooms which was TO DIE FOR! I've been eyeing it for a while. My bf wanted to get a pasta but when he asked the waitress about the size she said it was smaller and suggested to him a risotto with Oso buco which he was very very impressed with. Overall a great experience and I can't wait to check out the new location which is said to be bigger!
Stelvio	4	2019-07-06	We really enjoyed Stelvio- great Italian food and service. The waiter was also super helpful with the menu and wine pairings. The star of the night was definitely the ossobuco ristotto! It was delicious and I would definitely come back for it.
Stelvio	4	2017-12-05	"I discovered this tiny little Italian restaurant through yelp. On a warm summer day, I imagine it would be lovely to people watch on the patio (the restaurant is situated on a very busy section of Queen st).

I tried two dishes - tagliatelle with fresh homemade meat sauce and fried herbs, and the risotto alla milanese with osso buco. I really enjoyed both the dishes- the risotto, in particular, was richly flavourful. The portion size was also very generous, and I packed half of it home for lunch the next day.

Would definitely want to come back in the future and try other dishes!"
Stelvio	4	2017-11-10	"WHAT TO TRY?!

Since you most likely tried mainly southern Italian cuisine in the many Italian restaurants you've been to, you might be up to trying a restaurant that specializes in Northern italian cuisine here!! Basically I would recommend all the dishes here because it's a different method of flavouring and cooking style. 

We tried the sciatt, a buckwheat fritter that had Valtellina Casera DOP cheese inside the balls! Very unique and very tasty especially when it's served hot, the cheese melts inside. 

We also had the tagliatelle with Ragu Bianco. Homemade tagliatelle with homemade meat sauce. Pasta was al Dante just the way I like it and the pasta had just the right amount of sauce. Not too much and not little. 

We also ordered from the second section and got the polenta salsiccia e Funghi. The sausages on this polenta tasted so good and I'm a big fan of porcini mushroom too so I liked the bite to this mushroom. The polenta was okay, you really need to eat it with the sausage and the mushroom to add the flavor into each bite of this dish. 

The waiter was super friendly and nice. She would walk me through the menu and explain what she would recommend us to eat depending on how hungry and how heavy we want the dishes. She would also be brave enough to say if it was too much and asked us to settle for less food to really enjoy the meal. 

I loved the music they played at this restaurant. They played Italian and it really added to the experience. I thought I was in Italy for a second in my time spent at the restaurant. 

LAST TIP?

You can opt to share dishes because that's what we did so you don't have to just order pasta. You can opt to try the other dishes in the primi and secondi menu too! The restaurant is mainly open for dinners. Only time to catch them for lunch is Friday and Saturday!"
Stelvio	3	2017-10-13	"Stelvio is an Italian restaurant in Downtown Toronto. It was packed on a Saturday night and we were lucky to have a table. After glancing the menu, we placed our order. Shortly after, our server brought us a plate of Poppyseed Sesame Bread served with EVOO balsamic vinegar dipping sauce and herb marinated olives.

Based on other Yelp review, we ordered the Taroz, which consisted of crushed potatoes with green beans, butter, onion and cheese served on a iron skillet. It was to die for. The only other thing to die for was Zuppa D'Orzo Carciofi E Patate, which was a soup with barley, artichoke, potatoes, and garlic.

We're weren't too impressed with the Dante Salad, Tagialette Al Funghi Porcini, and Tagialette Al Funghi Porcini. The Dante Salad consisted of shredded pan seared chicken breast, Caesar DOP cheese, lettuce, and red chicory lightly tossed in a dijon vinaigrette. I didn't like how either Tagialette had much flavor or sauce. Tagialette Al Funghi Porcini consisted of fresh homemade tagliatelle pasta with porcini mushrooms. Tagialette Al Ragu Bianco consisted of fresh homemade tagliatelle pasta with homemade meat sauce and fried herbs including sage and rosemary."
Stelvio	3	2018-12-31	"I really have mixed feelings about this restaurant. I dined here for dinner and tried quite good amount of food from appetizer to pastas. I feel like this place is better for lunch as portions are small and the vibe and lighting in the restaurant was too light for me for an evening dinner. I loved the black and white simple decor, however I would definitely recommend having less light towards evening. 

As for the drink, I tried the Pinot Grigio, and I loved it. If you like an easy white wine with notes of sweetness, this would be perfect.

For appetizer, we ordered a cheese and cold cut board. I was not impressed with the selection of cheeses there. There were two types of cheese and two types of cold cuts. Both cheeses tasted very bland and simple. The portion was fairly good though and it came with a honey and house-made jam which was a nice garnish to it. We also got the meatball to share by the server's recommendation. Probably this was my least favorite item. It was different from a usual Italian meatball you imagine, maybe it is the Milanese way. However I did not like it and it was too dry and meaty. We asked for a side tomato sauce so we can dip them in it.

For main, we ordered two different pasta dishes, the Tagliatelle al funghi porcini and Casoncelli alla bergamasca. They make the pastas fresh in house which I think is what makes this restaurant special. The funghi pasta tasted really good and I loved the mushrooms in it, however I felt it was lacking sauce. Casoncelli alla bergamasca was a meat ravioli with some butter sauce on it, however there was just a little butter sauce on it and it tasted very basic to me. I would say both pastas had very small amount of sauce and both tasted very simple."
Stelvio	3	2020-02-15	The decor was nice and the staff were all very friendly and helpful but it was a veeeery long wait for our main course. I had the Tagliatelle special with sausage, mushroom and black truffles and it was ok, I wasn't that impressed. I wouldn't order it again. But others at my table enjoyed their meals.
Stelvio	1	2019-07-06	The service is terrible and the food is not good enough to make up for the awful service. The one good thing on the menu is the risotto with the veal shank, but everything else we ordered was just okay. The waitress we had didn't listen well enough and took too long doing everything. We weren't even there on a particularly busy night, so the lack of good service can't be blamed on how packed the restaurant was. I would save the money and settle for somewhere else instead.
Stelvio	4	2019-01-08	I love the risotto here. Pricey and there's extra wait time for it, but so creamy and cheesy and delicious.  The rabbit is also delish but I find the portion size a bit small (I could eat two portions both because of the taste and because of the size).  This place is perfect for a date night as it's very small and intimate despite its location which is in the middle of Queen Street busy-ness. This place is northern Italian as opposed to most Italian restaurants you come across, and the Italian I was with said that next time we should bring his Nonna. If that's not a ringing endorsement, I don't know what is.
Stelvio	4	2017-06-05	"Stumbled upon this place while shopping on Queen West, we felt like Italian and hey look! Stelvio is right here! What timing.

I loved pretty much everything about this place: the decor, the service, and especially the food. I've eaten at a LOT of Italian restaurants around the GTA and this place really stands above with the dishes on the menu, they are not like the usual offerings you see around here.

We tried the tagliatella with meat sauce, the sausage risotto, and started with the smashed potato appetizer (with onions, green beans, cheese and bacon). Literally every one of these dishes was amazing. 

My only complaint is that food took a while to come out, I found the seats very cramped and a bit uncomfortable by the end of our meal, and it was a lot louder in there than expected (though I blame this mainly on the loud couple next to us).

Overall there's no way i'm not going back here for the amazing food and lovely staff (I love the little patio out front too and want to check it out). Can't recommend this place enough."
Terroni	4	2020-02-06	"My friend and I came here for her bday. We went during the day time as it gets pretty packed during the night time. The ambience is nice and fancy but still casual. Keep in mind you're probably going to be seated really close to another table.

I ordered the Quattro Stagioni pizza. It was okay, I expected better it tasted kinda basic especially for the price.

My friend, I believe ordered Taiatelle all's Bolognese. I tried some and it had good flavour but nothing amazing.

Also, we got the calamari to share which was really good!

Overall my experience was good. I just wouldn't go back again, there are so many other Italians restaurants that are better."
Terroni	3	2020-02-20	"The only reason I visited was because I had a gift card due to poor service from my previous visit. I'd say they redeemed themselves in terms of service for this visit. Our server was extremely friendly, helpful, and attentive. We were also seated in an area downstairs from the main dining area which made it feel more intimate and allowed the sever to check up on us more often. I came for Valentine's Day dinner and was still able to get a table for a group of 6 a week in advance. 

I ordered the gnocchi and it was alright. The pasta itself was cooked perfectly but the sauce was kind of basic. I've had better gnocchi elsewhere but for the price point here, I was expecting a bit more. I think some pasta may be more worth it than others on their menu. The homemade gelato was the highlight of my meal - super creamy and soft, great flavour, good portion. I had the hazelnut and pistachio and it was some of the best gelato I've ever had. 

Overall, I think you could find better or just as good food elsewhere, at the same price point. But worth a try if your an Italian food lover, even if just for the gelato."
Terroni	3	2020-01-31	"We made resos for a Thursday night. Boy was this place packed! I liked the ambiance but felt like it was too noisy. I liked how it was dimly lit. 
I ordered the duck ravioli. Portion size seemed small. Sauce was good but I felt like it was missing something salty! 
My friend ordered the spicy sausage pasta which was tasty as well. She said it was al dente and the pieces of meat were good. It wasn't too salty or saucy.  
The complimentary bread was mediocre. It was cold and came in a folded paper basket. A small bowl of olive oil was hidden underneath. The olive oil was delishhh though! 
Overall it was alright. Prices are reasonable for the quality. I'm not sure if I'd go back again though!"
Terroni	1	2020-03-18	This place is definitely deceiving with all the good reviews. The food is not particularly good and we ordered a great variety of food so we could try a little bit of everything. The service was lacking and the mandatory tip amount is fairly high for big groups which we felt they did not deserve. The free bread they handed out at the beginning was not enough for the amount of people we had. We expected them to give us one per person at least and they did not warn us that we would be charged for it when we asked for more when we realized there was not enough for everyone. When the bills came and we asked about it, the server very rudely said if you just don't want to pay go talk to my manager. A lot of us will never come back to this restaurant.
Terroni	5	2019-11-13	"This is my go-to Italian restaurant in Toronto, and every time I go I order the truffle sausage pasta. I've tried other things in the menu over the years, but the truffle pasta stays my #1 fav ! 
Al dente pasta with homemade sausage and topped with a GENEROUS amount of shaved truffle.  (See picture) 
This time, we also shared the mushroom salad which was a perfect balance to our meal. (You need to love mushrooms though!) 

Would definitely recommend Terroni to anyone looking for a upscale yet casual Italian dinner in Toronto !"
Terroni	2	2019-12-12	"Very spacious restaurant, a bonus for downtown foodies. 
The location used to be a bank, so the architecture inside is unique, interesting, and stunning.
(Be sure to visit washrooms and vaults in the bsmt.) 

The menu is not typical Italian, which was a bit disappointing for my group of 7, and they're not open to substitutions for dietary / halal purposes. 

Our server was very insistent about what we should and shouldn't apply cheese to, a quick suggestion would've been nice - but then let ppl eat how they want to!

Food was a bit bland, although their tomato sauce tastes fresh and authentic. The fresh cut hot peppers they bring to the table saved our meals. 
*Be prepared to cut the uncooked basil on the Margherita pizza yourself ‍ it's just placed uncooked in the center.  

Desserts are a different story, very nice presentation and the taste was even better! The Tiramisu & Creme Caramel were a nice end to a mehh unexciting lunch. 

Not a lot of veggie/salad/vegan options for those who have medical / religious restrictions. 
But if you're into fusion menus and meat in everything  - this is definitely a great place to go for that."
Terroni	4	2020-03-03	Came here on a Saturday , made a reservation through Opentable on the day of. Was seated right away and was kindly greeted by the staff at the front. Our waiter was very knowledgable and helped guide us through the menu. We ordered 1 seafood pasta and 1 pizza. Overall both items were great for sharing for 2 people. The seafood pasta was very fresh and the pasta noodles tasted very fresh. The pizza we ordered was nice and soft and very fresh tasting. Overall I would say the food was avarage but overall ambiance and service of the restaurant deserves 4 stars. Would highly recommend making a reservation if you plan on dining here on the weekend!
Terroni	3	2020-01-27	"For so many years, I have never visit Terroni.  Actually after dinner tonight I don't think there's an urgent need as everything was normal and on the pricey side.

Was looking at the mushroom pasta special for Monday and the cost was  31.  I asked the waiter what's the portion sIze and he told me 5 pieces.....really?!

OK I went with the grilled calamari for $18 and a side of rapini for $10 instead.  Well, the calamari was alright, I like the tomato arugula salad a lot underneath but the rapini wasn't good as it was super hard to chew.

My friends had the $170 steak combo which came with a salad and a plate of veggies and it tasted good.

So my verdict is 2.5 stars  round up to 3 here we don't have half star option for review.  Prob won't be back tbh."
Terroni	3	2019-11-01	"Authentic italian food served in the same fashion.

Service: The staff were friendly, but the wait times were pretty unacceptable considering we had a large group with a reservation. We arrived on time, but still had to wait upwards of 30 minutes for a table, and it almost ruined the surprise birthday. The food came as ordered, but the waiters clearly didn't communicate with each other as they didn't know who ordered what and had to check several times.

Food: The pasta was cooked al dente, closer to the firmer side. You could tell the pasta was fresh, and they were fairly generous with the truffle shavings. However, the seasoning was a bit overwhelming, as it seemed to overpower the truffle flavour.

Overall: Seating was nice in a semi-private room, food was bene, but waiting half an hour for a reserved spot is not appreciated."
Terroni	4	2019-07-17	"Really delicious food.  The Santo Stefano pizza is a classic with arugula, buffalo mozzarella, and prosciutto.  Probably the best buffalo mozzarella I've had outside of Naples, Italy.  

The C't Mang pizza is a delicious white pizza with lots of mozzarella, Gorgonzola, fresh pears, walnuts, smoked prosciutto, and honey.  So sweet and tasty.  

I washed them down with sweet pear nectar and finished off my dinner with two scoops of gelato.  The hazelnut was rich and creamy, and the lemon flavor had a nice tang and was cool and refreshing.  

You do sit quite close to the next table, so I bumped elbows once with the lady next to me.  But the restaurant is quiet enough to still have a conversation despite all the hustle and bustle."
Terroni	3	2020-01-25	"I would describe this place as a trendy Italian restaurant. My review will only comment on the pizza as I haven't tried the pastas (it seems like my friends enjoyed them). 
I wasn't too impressed by the pizza, the crust was thin and quite crispy, toppings tasted fresh and good quality but not very generous. It's a good place to go for simple business meetings as the atmosphere is nice and trendy or maybe for a date but if you're looking for a more local small  business type of vibe, I would pass. 
Service was a good and fairly fast. I would mind coming back but not my first choice."
Terroni	4	2019-08-15	"Comes with complimentary bread to start. Lots of seating indoors, but you're best case would be to book a reservation. Unfortunately they don't book patio -- that's first come first serve. 

I got a pizza with pears, prosciutto, walnuts and honey $20 -- it was delicious!!!! Couldn't wait to eat it again lol the plate is quite filling. I could only eat half of it and took the rest home. 

Everyone enjoys the pasta -- looks amazing btw. 

Service was okay. Ambience dark and romantic (dim lights)."
Terroni	5	2019-07-24	"Was in Toronto for the weekend to celebrate my birthday. Was staying at a hotel nearby and was recommended this place. 

Came for lunch around 11:30 and asked to sit outside. The waiter immediately told us the specials and gave us a little time to look over the menu. She also gave us some recommendations on wine as well. 

For appetizer we had the Funghi Assoluti (Baked mushroom on arugula) and the fried calamari. The mushrooms were amazing and the calamari was super fresh didn't come with marinara like usual but it didn't need it. 

For main I had the spaghetti in canna a mare. Super flavorful and went great with my wine. My friends had the Rigatoni alla Norma, very good as well but the pasta was a bit more aldente than my friend prefers. We also shared the Tortellini it was so good the sauce was amazing we polished it off with bread. We also got the Branzino and the Li Pecuri pizza (definitely a sharing portion of pizza)"
Terroni	4	2019-04-19	"I've always found Terroni (and some other similar Italian restaurants) slightly overpriced for the food, but I quite enjoyed my dinner here recently. My bill was almost $40 for a main and two apps split among 5 people, but I left quite satisfied and full.

We started off with the beef carpaccio and grilled calamari for the table. I wasn't the biggest fan of the carpaccio, which was thinly sliced raw beef served with spicy arugula and shaved cheese, drizzled with lemon juice. The contrast of the smooth beef, rich cheese, and harsh bite of the arugula was an interesting combination. I did, however, love the grilled calamari! The portion size was mediocre; there were only about three small pieces there. That said, it was grilled to a nice crisp and char, and was so flavourful! I enjoyed that it was also served on a leafy bed of greens with tomatoes, making it a nice and light starter.

My main was the Spaghetti in Canna al Mare - a tomato based spaghetti topped with different seafood such as clams, mussels, calamari, and shrimp. I was very pleasantly surprised at how generous they were with the toppings. My plate had lots of calamari and roughly 8 mussels/clams, along with two meaty shrimps. I wouldn't say that the seafood is very fresh, but the slightly spicy and tangy tomato sauce helped add some flavour and depth. The portions are actually a decent size too - I was unable to finish mine, but fortunately a friend pitched in and helped!

My friend ordered a pizza, and although I forget which one he got, I distinctly remember him asking the server for the one with the most meat (guys will forever be guys). I sampled a small bite, and it was pretty good! There's a fair amount of cheesy goodness on top, and the crust is super thin. There's a nice crunch when you bite into it. Our main complaint is that the pizza arrives uncut - and you're expected to use your fork and knife to manage.

On that note, keep in mind that Terroni doesn't really allow for substitutions or modifications (e.g., doesn't accommodate no cheese or sub cheese requests), and that extends towards asking for their pizza cut. Although my experience here was quite lovely, though I believe there are plenty other Italian places in the city to visit and will be unlikely to return anytime soon!"
Terroni	4	2020-02-21	My friend and I finally decided to go here to give it a try after hearing good words about this location. I had the Spaghetti in Canna a Mare. Flavorful sauce without cheese but the spaghetti was a bit ubdercooked which I found hard to chew. Seafood was fresh and well absorbed the flavors, the calamari was especially tender. My friend had the duck confit stuffed ravioli. She enjoyed it a lot. Spacious restaurant and good service. Will come back again to try the pizza, might skip the pasta in future. They have an entire page of pizza to offer!
Terroni	2	2019-10-20	"This restaurant is really for the experience. With such a lovely ambience and outstanding service from all staff, the food did not meet up to par with what you may expect.

For starters the food is on the higher price end, and smaller quantities. Although, it is all homemade pasta!! 

I've had homemade pasta before so I had high standards walking in.. I was so excited to try the Gnocchi because well, I LOVE Gnocchi. 

However, I was disappointed. The pasta itself was quite soft and seemed soggy with the red sauce altogether. There was no 'bite' to it, more of a 'mush'. I did not enjoy my meal and that left a significant impression on my take of what the rest of the entrees may be like. 

Note: Calamari & Earl Grey tea were delicious!"
Terroni	4	2019-02-22	"My bf took me here for valentine's based on a friends recommendation. Apparently it used to be a court house? I can kinda see it. I like the interior and vibe of this place. We sat in the middle, small table for 2. It's kinda crowded to the next table - the next ppl coming in to sit beside us said the same thing as well.

As always, I check reviews on yelp to see what I'd want to get. I got the ricotta cheese rav pasta and it comes with I think 5 pieces. Looks like a little but trust, the cheese is heavy af. I got full after 2.5 LOL. BUT I didn't wanna pack it so I ate it all!! It did get overwhelming after a while. There was slight cream sauce so I moved pieces of my pasta around for extra flavour.

Prior to that, they brought free bread (4 pieces) with a side of olive oil and peppers. Idk I didn't really like the bread lmao. Wish it also came with balsamic vinegar

I also ordered a bellini. I'm used to my bellini being frozen but this is not. It was a little strong which was good but it was just okay to me. 

Service was great! But food was just ok. Bf agrees with me. 
If I come back, I think i'll try a pizza. Saw so many pass by our table and it looked sooo good! Next time"
Terroni	5	2019-08-27	Had a delicious dinner here my first nite in Toronto. Beautiful space in an incredible historic building. We ordered lots of appetizers with my absolute favourite being the Funghi Assoluti (basked oyster mushrooms, parmigiano, bread crumbs, extra-virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar, arugula,garlic). SO good! for my main, I chose the Spaghetti al Limone (spinach, capers, parmigiano reggiano shavings, lemon, extra-virgin olive oil). Literally one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had. Our Braziluan waiter was wonderful & so sweet & attentive. Absolutely love this place!
Terroni	5	2019-01-21	"5 stars for a wonderful, delicious Italian meal on one of my last nights in Toronto with my fabulous team. 

Our large group of 10 came in a bit earlier than our reservation, so we waited in the lounge area while our table was prepared. The great thing about this is that there is a bar in the lounge, so we were able to have a few glasses of wine while we waited. 

Once our table was ready we were led to a beautiful private room in the back. Our server came over right away, dropped off a round of waters, and started pouring a never-ending supply of wine. He was awesome throughout, always making sure to check in on us, fill up our glasses, and take plates away before the table got too crowded. 

Yes, the wine was delicious, but the food... wow, the food was even better. There were a few appetizers shared throughout the whole table: calamari, burrata, and bread w/ olive oil and balsamic, just to name a few. For mains, my work pals ordered an assortment of pizzas, salads, and pastas. I don't remember everything that was on the table, but I do remember that everything I tried was delicious. For myself, I ordered the tortellini ricotta (spinach tortellini stuffed w/ ricotta & pecorino, topped w/ sage, butter, and parmesan). It. Was. Delicious. Even though I was pretty full by the time my main got to the table, I still finished the whole plate clean, because it was just so good. 

Overall, it was a wonderful evening with my work family. Great food, great drinks, great service, and great company... what else could you want?"
Terroni	4	2019-09-03	"One of my favourite Italians in the city and not just for the food, this location is great for a meal out due to its ambience and the setting in such a historic, classic building - really adds to the experience!

Not to brag but being greedy I had a pizza, pasta and salad last time I went and all were great with fresh ingredients and the salad in particular was really refreshing sandwiched in between my carb medley!

Very good wine selection too.

PS - it you go on a date and it's rubbish they have jail cells underground sooo....."
Carisma	5	2019-12-28	"Good meal last night at Carisma, an old school Italian resto. Michael, the owner, and staff were gregarious and took great care of us. Food was good, but nothing out of this world. 

Food: 4/5
Service: 4.5/5
Value: 4.5/5
Ambience:4.5/5

That said, with the equivalent of a glass of wine per person and a bottle of Prosecco, appetizers, mains, desert and tip the total bill came to 138$ per person which was reasonable for fine dining. If this place offers corkage, I can see ourselves returning."
Carisma	4	2020-01-04	"Got to finally try out the new location with a couple of friends and it's a really great place to go for a nice night out. The restaurant is beautiful, it was easy to get a reservation and the service is impeccable. Our server gave us great recommendations, was super helpful and we got our food in a timely fashion. 

Keep in mind it's more of a fine dining establishment so I found the dishes to be pricey for what we got but I thought it was worth it for a special occasion but not somewhere I'd go frequently. 

The most important part, the food, was delicious. Ordered the tuna tartare ($25) that came with guac as a starter and it was super fresh and tasted great. They also brought our bread in olive oil that was so good and soft that I could've finished the whole plate.

I ordered the spaghettini with shrimp ($30), which our server had said was one of their more popular dishes and it was SOOOO good. The shrimp with the flavourful tomato cream sauce was to die for. My husband got the pasta of the day, a truffle pasta, but thought it was a bit bland and at $40 way too $$$ for what it was. 

Definitely somewhere I'd recommend for a nice meal if you're okay to spend some $ as the food is great as well as the ambiance. You'll be in for a treat."
Carisma	4	2019-08-25	"I came here for an event held by Lincoln Motors & had a great time. The staff was friendly, jovial & very attentive. I had a mixed green salad with shaved parmesan & steak for my main course. The steak was cut into strips, tasted SO juicy & was flavorful. We had a platter of various mini desserts, which were good but nothing extraordinary. 

Service: 5/5
Presentation: 4/5
Taste: 4/5
Price: 3/5
Ambiance: 4/5
Overall: 4/5"
Carisma	3	2019-07-04	"Not feeling it for the new fancy location.

Love the old location with old friendly staff than the new ones.  The price is more expensive, and the food is not as good.  The new staff didn't know about serving / dinner etiquette.  Serving both left and right side.  With the lower food quality and higher price tag / seemed more fancy environment will look for more.  The owner is still there and he has to work hard and busy himself by telling the new younger staff what needs to be done.

Really disappointing that the food was not as good as before (far from it)."
Carisma	4	2019-04-30	"This restaurant had nice modern decor and comfortable seating. I went with a group of 9 people and they gave us a large table that was sectioned off so we had some privacy. 

Food wise I would say was ok, like 3.5/5 stars. This is because the portions seemed very small. The calamari appetizer tasted good, mushroom salad appetizer was good but not worth the price in my opinion, the complimentary bread was a bit burnt and too crunchy, the mozarella with tomato wasn't worth the price and was too simple ... For the main course I got the chicken (first item on the menu under secondi). It came with two large pieces of white and dark meat with potatoes, a grilled lemon on top, and some veggies. This was worth the price because of the amount of meat that was given. A few people at my table ordered the gnocchi which looked very plain when it arrived, but tasted ok. The gnocchi is the same price as the chicken and I would say the chicken is worth more. 

Overall, Iikely won't return often to this restaurant due to the portion sizes, however if I had to pick a few items to have again it would be the calamari appetizer and the chicken dish as the main course."
Carisma	4	2019-08-25	"Visited On: October 2017
Meal: Dinner
Dining Style: Dine-in
Would I Return: Yes

Ordered:
-Steak

Thoughts:
Came here as part of the Lincoln Motor event where they had a 3 course menu. It was my first time having steak and I really enjoyed it. The fluffy bread with the rosemory and oil was to die for. Dessert was an assortment of fruits and baked goods. Service was really good. Our waiter was friendly and funny. He was super quick in refilling our empty wine glasses."
Carisma	5	2019-04-21	"My boyfriend and I went here for my birthday a couple weeks ago. The staff were all very friendly, and our server was equal parts funny and knowledgable. We started with the grilled calamari, which normally isn't my cup of tea but it was delicious. Very light taste, excellent for an appetizer. 

For the main course I had the beef tenderloin with wine reduction and it was quite probably the best beef I have ever had. It's quite a pricey dish but well worth it if you can swing it! 

Finally, I had the tiramisu for dessert. They brought it out with a sparkler, because my boyfriend mentioned it was my birthday. The dish itself was perfect, light and creamy with a good balance of chocolate and coffee tastes.

If you want an elegant dinner served by kind and attentive people, this is a great place for it. Also a perfect date night restaurant!"
Carisma	5	2019-02-17	First time trying their new location, and see if they can keep up their best quality of food and services. Carisma never disappointed me. Upon arrival, I notice the environment is much nicer and more elegant than their old location, as well as their wide open kitchen. We ordered scallop with foie gras, and squid with tomato salsa. Both are delicious, but the scallop is memorable. For main courses, we had the tiger shrimp tomato sauce pasta, and mix seafood in tomato soup. The tiger shrimps are so huge, never seen such a huge size in dining for a long time. For dessert, cream burlee is a must, a small shareable size to finish off the meal. Carisma is definitely a well known high quality Italian fine dining in the downtown Toronto area, and already start my planning to go again for dinner!
Carisma	2	2019-01-10	"Disappointed.

I came here for dinner and the experience was underwhelming overall. 

The ambience is nice. The service was adequate and efficient. However, the food was disappointing. The food wasn't bad, but just not what I expected for the price."
Carisma	4	2019-01-09	"I booked a table at Carisma for NYE for a few reasons. First, I wanted something relatively low key since we had to head to the airport early the next morning. Second, I liked that they had their regular menu going on NYE and we weren't going to get a prix fixe meal; I find holiday ones like NYE and Valentine's Day usually disappoint. Third, it was walkable from our hotel, so we didn't have to contend with surge pricing or getting a ride (not sure how hard that is in Toronto, but it's a mess at home).

I'm not sure when the restaurant moved, the interior looks quite different from the pictures I saw in reviews. White tables, teal, velvet seating left it feeling much brighter that the old space. The acoustics aren't great, it was quite loud in the place which detracted from the romantic vibe they seemed to be trying to create.

We started out with cocktails and the burratina appetizer. He got a manhattan and I got an aperol spritz. They split the appetizer for us, which was very nice. The appetizer itself was good, but not outstanding. We had planned to each order an appetizer portion of pasta and a secondi, but our server felt that might be too much food. Instead, we opted to split the gnocchi as our primi, which again came split for us. It was creamy and rich and the gnocchi delicate, but I felt that it would have benefited from a but more salt. For my main, I got the sea bass and boyfriend got the filet. We also split a bottle of valpolicello. My sea bass came over veggies and potatoes and was quite delicious - my favorite of all the things I ate. Boyfriend like his dish, but felt like it had a bit too much char on it. 

For dessert, we had a glass of dessert wine and split the walnut tart. Both were quite good and to cap off a very filling meal, we had a glass of champagne at midnight with those that stuck around to ring in the New Year.

Service was attentive and knowledgeable. My only knock is that the pacing at the beginning of the meal was quite fast. We had barely finished the last bite of burratina when our gnocchi arrived.

Overall, I got what I wanted; a nice low key NYE and a good meal."
Carisma	5	2020-01-18	Happened upon this place while walking downtown looking for a dinner spot during a work trip.  It was wonderful!  I had the gnocchi and creme brûlée for dessert.  I'll be back!
Carisma	1	2019-10-20	"- Not worth for its price. Both service and quality of food. 
- Pappardelle very hard not fully cooked
- Risotto hard as well 
- In this city when there are so many Italian restaurants to compete with, this type of quality simply unacceptable. 
- The lady who served us seemed very unhappy and no smile during the whole dining period.  At the end of the mains, she wiped the dinning table but did such a sloppy job that all crumbles fell on my lap.  I do not know the purpose of doing it. 
- the ""supervisor"" or the manager walked around the room and consciously or subconsciously patted our velvet lounge chair to tell us hurry up cause we might have chatted too long and eating too slow.  
Overall, we are a group of three and we picked this place for our Japanese friend's visit for our first time. None of us would return again.  Pure disappointment."
Carisma	3	2019-05-24	"So far Scallop and Foie Gras Appetizer was the best. Ordered appetizer size of of Seafood Pasta dish. The pasta was super al dente, to the point of being tough. The one one mussel I had was gross but the lone shrimp was good, as  was the calamari. 
Hubby's steak was good but my lamb chops left much to be desired. I prefer the taste of Australian or New Zealand lamb and I forgot to ask where it was from."
Carisma	5	2018-10-12	"Took my friend here for a birthday lunch. It's been a while since then so my details are sketchy but here's what I remember:

Decor is very dark and luxe.

The food was really tasty. I remember going in with no expectations but we both loved what we ordered and were totally pleasantly surprised!

Would definitely return."
Carisma	5	2019-08-06	Fine Italian dining. Valued accordingly, but you certainly get what you pay for and the service was fantastic (as was the food). At our table the wild boar ragu pasta, sea bass and risotto were favourites. Our selections of Osso buco and delicate fish fillets perfectly prepared and flavored. The restaurant filled up as show time approached but we hardly noticed - not overly noisy despite being full by the time we departed. The food and service were both exceptional. Carisam is our number one choice for Italian food in Toronto. Sophisticated, elegant and classic. Love this place!
Carisma	5	2017-08-06	"Carisma was beyond delicious! The customer service was amazing and the food was even better. We started with the complimentary bread seasoned with rosemary, olive oil, and salt. It was amazing! I ate a piece before I could even snap a picture. We ordered the grilled calamari as an app. It was seasoned simply and well. You could taste the charred, grilled flavor. It was served with tomatoes, olives, etc. 5 stars for that alone. 

For entrees my friend got the daily special of halibut served with an avocado salsa she tasted tasted amazing. I got the rack of lamb cooked medium. The seasoning was perfection and the lamb was cooked perfectly. It came with mashed potatoes and vegetables. I cleaned my plate. Our server and the other servers helping him were hilarious. They were the nicest gentleman ever and really great at their job! Our Carisma experience was outstanding. I highly recommend dining here!"
Carisma	3	2019-02-12	"I have frequently gone by this restaurant, and was curious to try it out. I dined here for a business meeting with several of my colleagues.

The ambiance and decor is elegant and romantic overall, and the staff are very welcoming and hospitable.

Carisma has been an establishment in Toronto for years, and I was eager to try it out based on recommendations.

Upon entering, I was greeted by very hospitable staff. The restaurant was entirely empty upon my arrival, which I found to be unusual given that it was peak dinner time.

Our server was attentive and knowledgeable and had great recommendations about specials that evening and the menu. 

My colleague and I decided to share the Grilled Calamari appetizer, which was quite flavorful in nature with the addition of olives and herbs. Although I didn't partake in the bread, my colleague mentioned that it was quite soft and delicious overall!

For our entrees, we ordered the SeaBass Filet which according to my companion was well-seasoned and delicious overall; another colleague asked for a 'surprise' entree and was presented with a combined dish of the gnocchi and agnolotti, which she enjoyed. My entree was the ahi tuna dish which I was excited about; however, I must admit that this was overdone. It was presented as an entire tuna steak, which was likely the issue in the cook overall, as had it been sliced tuna, there may have been more control over the cook. I had asked for it to be rare, and it was far more than well-done, and even charred on one side. 

Overall, I am glad that I tried this establishment. I commend the staff and service for their efforts."
Carisma	4	2019-08-07	Great spot for really good Italian. My wife loved it here for her birthday. Food was great and service top notch. Worth a try.
Carisma	1	2019-07-04	"Disappointed. 
Good service but not so good food. The pasta was so tough to the point of being uncooked!  the bread was good."
Carisma	5	2018-11-10	I LOVE the new location!  Same exquisite food and the friendliest service but in a bright, modern, beautiful new location!  Congratulations on the next delicious chapter of my favorite restaurant in Toronto!!
Trattoria Taverniti	5	2019-12-07	This quaint Italian restaurant was an excellent choice for our family celebration. From the minute we walked in, we felt welcomed and asked if we wanted drinks etc....our waitress was very professional and accommodating; exceeded our expectations. The appetizers were delicious, especially the arrincini and calamari. Dinner was amazing; the pizza was perfect and the variety of pastas were fresh and tasty. Dessert was refreshing, especially the sorbet, homemade of course. Well deserving a 5 star.
Trattoria Taverniti	4	2020-01-04	"This place is pretty much the definition of a hole in the wall (which full disclosure is in my opinion the best type of restaurant). It's dark and tiny and has very intimate and authentic vibe. 

We started with the meatballs appetizer and those things were melt in your mouth amazing. The marinara was so rich and flavourful we were ecstatic when the server dropped off some bread so we could soak up every last bit of it. 

We opted to share a couple things since neither of us had been there before:

The Bolognese Rigatoni and the Diavolo Pizza. Both were great but the real standout was the Rigatoni. We both heavily favoured it. The sauce was rich and hearty the pasta perfectly al dente, there was absolutely nothing lacking in this dish. 

The only down downside to our experience here was we did have to wait with dirty dishes on our table (which is my biggest restaurant pet peeve) for about 15 minutes after we had finished eating to get our bill. Normally this would really bother me but the friendliness of the staff and the quality of the food really made this place enjoyable.

We look forward to coming back."
Trattoria Taverniti	1	2019-09-09	"I was craving pizza for supper this evening.  I was walking along College Street and came across Trattoria Taverniti.  It looked interesting and I'd never been there so I thought I'd check it out.

When I got here around 6:30pm, it was fairly empty but filled up pretty quickly.

I ordered the Carne pizza.  It was a good pizza and I ended up taking some home for lunch tomorrow.  The crust was crispy and I guess it was the sausage that had a bit of a bite.

I paid my bill and was finishing up my wine, getting ready to go.  Then one of the servers asked if I would move to the patio to a high top chair because they needed my table.  I said I wasn't going to be much longer and didn't want to move to a high top (I have a wonky knee).  About ten seconds later, the second server came over and asked me to move and I told her the same thing.  About five minutes later, one of the servers said I really had to leave because they really needed my table.  I just had a sip of wine left and again said I'd be leaving shortly (and did).  I felt a bit uncomfortable because the table next to mine was looking over and wondering what was going on.

So what started out being a pleasant meal got ruined.  I understand that a small restaurant needs to turn the tables over to make money.  But if the table was reserved and I needed to be gone by 7:30pm (so in about an hour), they should have said so when I was seated so the expectations were set ... rather than kicking me out because someone else needed the table.  Definitely a customer service fail.  As good as the pizza was, I didn't feel valued as a customer so won't be back."
Trattoria Taverniti	1	2018-11-21	"I was in shock with food here...the food was extremely disappointing. For prices that are on par with most mid-range Italian restaurant, the food was horrible.
 
I came here with reservations and we were seated immediately. It was during dinner hours but they only had one staff serving all the tables. With just one server, the service was really slow from bringing us the menus and taking down our orders. 
 
Service:
 
The service was slow since they don't have many staff. 
 
Food:
 
My friend and I ordered two appetizers and two entrees to share. Out of the four items we ordered, only one of the item was decent with the rest being disappointing. 
 
N'duja bruschetta - We were deciding to order a bruschetta and opted for this one because it was different. The menu described this to be a bruschetta with a spicy pork sausage spread drizzled with honey. Although I was aware that this was going to be just a spread on bread, it looked disappointing when it arrived to the table because the spread was so thin. I was expecting something thicker to give it more flavor.  I also looked at other tables bruschetta and it looked very average.
 
Calamari Fritti - Another disappointing appetizer. When this arrived, I was a bit shocked because it didn't even look like there was batter... When my friend and I tried it, we both agreed that there wasn't enough crisp. The dish didn't look appetizing either.  
 
Gnocchi Gorgonzola - I wanted to try the gnocchi since the menu states they are handmade. The pasta came out and I thought the color was unappealing; it was like a greenish/greyish color. I guess it is because this sauce is a nutty creamy sauce. The texture of the gnocchi was chewy and nice. However, I wasn't a fan of the sauce.
 
Tagliatelle al Funghi Misti - This was AWFUL Some of the noodles were stuck together and this is the first time I've experienced this at a restaurant. The menu does mention this is a lighter sauce, and I thought it was a lighter flavor....but I didn't expect it to be less saucy.  There was BARELY any sauce actually.  The sauce was pretty much nonexistent and I felt like eating noodles in water. This pasta had no taste. It was $18 and it was literally just plain noodles without much sauce and flavor; the pasta was very dry. 
 
Overall:
 
I would never return. With most of their pastas ranging from $17-20, I was expecting similar quality to other restaurants in this price range. The tagliatelle was so dry and awful. The bruschetta also barely had any toppings on it."

Service: 3 Stars
Ambience: 4 Stars
Fill Factor: Satisfied

While looking for some good Italian food on College street we stumbled onto this restaurant. When we entered there were about 5 empty tables but according to the hostess they were all reserved. They did manage to squeeze us in though but many groups were turned away during our time there. So I'd you plan to come here it may be a good idea to reserve a table in advance.

Once we were seated we ordered the gnocchi gorgonzola, rigatoni Bolognese, and Stracciatella soup. Let me start off by saying the gnocchi was great. The texture was great and the sauce was nice and creamy. However do note that the sauce was a little bitter so maybe the rosee sauce would be a better choice in this case. I tried a bit of the rigatoni and it was delicious. Loved the sauce. Finally we tried the Stracciatella soup which had shredded chicken and egg drop. It was our first time trying it and it was perfect for the weather that day.

The service was alright here. The servers were friendly but they were really busy so there was no further interaction after they brought our food until we asked for the bill.

The restaurant itself was nice and comfortable. It is not a very big space but it never felt cramped.

I am glad we tried this place out. We enjoyed the food very much and I would love to come back here to try the pizzas next time."
Trattoria Taverniti	3	2019-06-14	"Trattoria taverniti is a little place in Little Italy downtown. Staff are very nice and the decorations are very homie. I ordered the rigatoni bolognese and the pasta is uncooked but that's how it is served but it was very good ! The flavor was good the sauce was just right and there was lots of meat in it! My friend ordered the spaghetti and it was a bit salty for him and it was uncooked a bit. The Quattro formaggi was good and very cheesy and oil ! 
The only bad thing was the service it was very very slow. My friend finished his food before us and we had to wait about another 15-20 mins for our dishes to come. Also asking for water took a while to get their attention because they were all zooming by the tables. 

Overall though the food here is quite good but a little pricey"
Trattoria Taverniti	5	2020-04-20	This is one of our favorite Italian restaurants. It's small and usually requires a reservation, but the food, atmosphere, servers and cooks make it a great experience. We enjoyed most pizzas and the lasagna or carbonara, but everything on the menu is good.
Trattoria Taverniti	3	2020-02-15	In a word, mediocre ! Always a hit or miss. Cramped ,over priced and not overly well trained servers. Stick to the basics when ordering & pass on the deserts. Try this place , you may get lucky but it's always a gamble. Sometimes it pays off , sometimes bust....
Trattoria Taverniti	4	2019-09-13	This is a tiny place but luckily there were tables open without a reservation on a Friday evening. They have a good amount of wine options and the wine doesn't come in wine glasses but just normal drinking glasses. I had the gnocchi with bolognese sauce and the portion was large and it was really good. Maybe not the most flavorful Italian meal but very good.
Trattoria Taverniti	5	2019-03-17	"This was such a lovely find 
Classic and authentic simple and elegant Italian food
Cozy beautiful rustic room red checkered table clothes and lovely pastas!
We had the arugula salad, shared the lasagna and then the pesto tagliatelle. Our server was from Italy. The owner is the Nona of the family. Family traditions and everything 
Going back ASAP, it was great"
Trattoria Taverniti	5	2018-08-14	"Went with my friend out and we found this place.
I thought it will be closed cause of the yelp time it showing us but lucky us got a spot. 
We decided to sit in the patio it was a very cozy one .
My friend ordered a margarita pizza and it was sooooo good.
I ordered the gnocchi with shrimp and I fall in love it was to good.
The waitress was very friendly.
The only thing I didn't like was that the table was not stable it was moving around with every move we did.
The food was perfect would definitely recommend it.
Is a good place to have a date or even a family get together.
Very good keep on going like this."
Trattoria Taverniti	5	2019-08-15	"This was a very memorable dining experience in Little Italy and was a very good choice.  We made the mistake of coming on a Saturday night without reservations; however, we were able to sit outside.  The poor Canadians!  Most of them couldn't handle the summer heat of dining al fresco on a sweltering day, but this was fine with us.

We were well cared for outside, and the food was terrific.  We got the house red wine which was an affordable and pleasant option.  I got the daivolo pizza and it was cooked to perfection.

These guys really should think about expanding, because they could probably double their business with the number of people they turned away as we dined.  Granted it was a Saturday, but it was obviously a popular option for both locals and tourists like us."
Trattoria Taverniti	1	2019-07-12	"Absolutely terrible food and even worse attitude and service. 

Didn't even have a bite of the food"
Trattoria Taverniti	5	2019-06-30	"This place is awesome!! Very authentic and intimate. The food is really good. The service is great and even the chef comes at each table! 
The place is small, reservation is needed and there's a line outside! 
I recommend this Italian traditional place!"
Trattoria Taverniti	5	2018-12-18	"Really good Italian restaurant: ordered the mushroom and the bolognese pastas, a pizza and a dessert for 3 people with a bottle of wine came up to approx 115
Cute cozy 
Waiters are Italian
Really good prices for the area"
Trattoria Taverniti	4	2017-09-11	"Great selection in menu. Staff is friendly but under staffed, took too long to get some attention.

Did was outstanding and hot. No complaints about quality and freshness. Presentation was neat and simple.

Will definitely come back again"
Trattoria Taverniti	5	2019-07-10	Amazing food, atmosphere, and workers. The owner and his mother are really down to earth and the waitress was super nice and gave good recommendations.
Trattoria Taverniti	4	2019-10-02	Very good pasta dishes ! This place was recommended by an Italian friend and this is her go to spot for Italian pasta ! I tried the shrimp one and the mushroom one and they were both delicious and filling. Staff is super friendly and were not annoyed by the baby that was with us. Tiramisu was not bad. The pizza looked really good too. Will come back again ! It's better to book as this place was busy when we arrived.
Trattoria Taverniti	5	2019-10-23	"An amazing casual dining spot with great food. One of the better carbonaras I've had in Toronto. A great spot for a family outing, date night or casual dining with friends. 
I thought the prices were very good and the portions perfect. 
LOVED IT!"
Trattoria Taverniti	5	2018-05-07	"Stumbled across this cute little gem after a drive through little Italy. We found a street adjacent to the restaurant that we were able to park on for free (after hours). The service was great we were promptly seated upon arriving. There was only one table for two left but I think they were saving it for a couple as we were seated at the bar. 

My cousin and I decided that we would order a bunch of food and share everything which was great! We ordered the original bruschetta and it was delicious! There was Parmesan cheese on top and perfectly season tomatoes with a crispy baguette bottom. We also had the calamari which was lightly battered but very flavourful. As a main we ordered a pizza with salami and carbonara pasta. The pizza was really good I loved the crispy crust and the thick layer of cheese. The pasta was good but I've had better. We left with full bellies and had a great evening out. I can't wait to come back and try some other tasty items off the menu!"
Fieramosca	5	2020-03-12	"Definitely a wow dinner. Everything was great!

Grilled Calamari  
Eggplant Parmesan  
Sautéed mushrooms 
Mushroom Pasta 
Chocolate Cake 

Excellent value !-)"
Fieramosca	5	2020-03-12	"Ma ma Mia, the best Italien Restaurant in Toronto.
I tell this as a Le Cordon Bleu trained person from Paris, great athmosphere, amazing owner and fantastic service. thanks to Paul and Floriana.."
Fieramosca	5	2019-05-07	"great service & very attentive. our server picked out our courses for us. we had antipasta selection, soup (tortilini), mushroom risotto, carbonara pasta, lamb chops and veal. for dessert we had their housemade tiramisu, berry cheesecake, and a rich chocolate cake.
my belly was beyond satisfied!"
Fieramosca	2	2019-06-02	"Honestly, I don't know how this place averages 4.5 stars. My review would have been a 3.5 had it not been for the horrible service. 

My party made a reservation for about 12 people and we were given the room upstairs where other parties were dining as well. The layout and spacing in this restaurant are very tight so watch your step. The seating in the front doesn't quite make sense layout wise. When I walked up to the stairs me and an employee were basically dancing around each other to just get by each other...just why.

Our server the entire night honestly had an attitude problem. He basically had a stick up his ***. He was passive aggressive the minute we got there all the way to the end. He asked if we wanted appetizers and since we were waiting on a few people we asked for a couple of minutes. Unlike a regular waiter who would walk away and let you discuss he stood there hovering and just waiting for us to give him an answer before leaving. Even when he was putting dishes down he was just dropping them and tossing side plates here and there, it was completely unprofessional. It was time for pasta and while our waiter dished out the cheese another waiter helped with pepper. But the pepper waiter took a little longer than the cheese and you could hear our waiter yelling at the pepper waiter from the other room. Is this not supposed to be a classy environment? Why are you yelling at him in front of all the customers? 

Aside from the horrible service, the food was actually very good and the portions were huge! I ordered the Spaghetti Mare de Mario and the amount of seafood definitely did not disappoint! There were a ton of mussels but the spaghetti was not fully cooked. I had a chunk of it still stuck to each other and hard...

Overall I do not think this place deserves the rating it has based on this experience."
Fieramosca	5	2020-02-28	We went for our anniversary and had an amazing time. The service was fantastic, the food was unreal, and the portion sizes were perfect. The restaurant is essentially a converted house so the atmosphere is very homey. We left with full bellies and full hearts.
Fieramosca	4	2018-01-16	"Yet another fancy Italian restaurant in Yorkville.  Probably fancy but nothing more than fluff, or so i thought.  I must admit i was quite wrong.  Although the cost to dine there is on a steeper side, i find that it was worth it.  
There were plenty of dishes and drinks to choose from.  And on top of that, there were plenty of specials that's off the menu too.  I chose a fish dish from the special (ah hem... doesn't mean cheaper), and i was pleasantly surprised.  The food came in generous portion, and was nicely flavored.  Food presentation was very pretty to look at.  Overall, everyone had the same opinion and enjoyed their food thoroughly. 
Service was decent.  The server was polite and attentive, but at the same time gave us space to enjoy ourselves.  
Will definitely go back again to try their other dishes."
Fieramosca	5	2019-06-15	"Those of you that say the food is no good here...you simply don't know what you're talking about.  This is quality food with generous portion sizes.   Beautiful restaurant as well.   It's a little pricey but not outrageous.  Buffalo Mozzarella, Eggplant parm, carbonara all top notch.  Maybe not a 5 of 5 but pretty darn close.

Would definitely recommend."
Fieramosca	4	2018-09-13	"I came here last night with my family and had a pleasant experience. The wait staff was friendly. The food was quite good - I had the caprese salad t start and grilled calamari for main. I had a few bites of my fiancé's pasta with shrimp and the pasta was perfectly al Dante. My fiancé's grandmother had the grilled sardines, and his grandfather had the liver. Everyone was very happy with their meals and the portions are quite substantial - you won't leave hungry!

The restaurant is very classic in the sense of very ""white table cloths"" and male servers only which I don't love. It is also on the pricy side (my dish came with 3 medium size pieces of calamari and grilled vegetables for $29 plus tax and tip - would have been $10 cheaper at a Greek restaurant at the Danforth). 

We sat in the back of the restaurant which was close to a very pretty private patio that would be perfect to eat dinner at on a sunny summer evening."
Fieramosca	5	2019-07-21	Just dropped by for lunch with clients the other day and everything was delicious. The portion size is also generous. I think this is one of the best value Italian dining experience in the city!
Fieramosca	3	2018-06-19	"Had a good dinner here last week! The interior is very traditional Italian and very cozy. Restaurant seems to be in an old house. There is a back patio as well a terrace on the third floor but we didn't get to check those out. 

The meal started with warm bread, we also got a caprese salad which i thought was just okay (tomatoes and basil weren't super fresh). My main was pappardelle with tomato sauce, shrimp and mushrooms. The best thing about the dish was how hot it was when it came out! It stayed hot for the entire time I was eating it which was awesome. I also loved the sauce which tasted very fresh and tomato-ey. The shrimp itself was kind of a letdown - it was a little overcooked and they also had the tails on which made it a little awkward to eat. Additionally, there seemed to be a couple pieces of shrimp shell in the pasta - the first time I ate a piece I thought it was maybe a tail I hadn't put off to the side but when it happened again I realized it was a piece of shell. My partner had the carbonara pasta which he said was just okay. For dessert we had tiramisu, it was delicious and a good portion for sharing. The meal was a little pricey, but everything is in Yorkville.

The service could have been better. We spent some time waiting to give our order and also to get water, and when the server did come by he seemed to be in a hurry. My partner felt bad since we'd come in without a reservation, and he wondered if they needed the table - but if the restaurant didn't have room for us, it's their responsibility communicate that - either tell us they don't have a table available or that we need to leave by a certain time. (Neither of those things were mentioned when we were seated.) Our entire meal was just over an hour long so we certainly weren't taking an unusually long time to eat.

Overall the meal was fine but next time I'll probably try one of the other italian restaurants in the neighbourhood!"
Fieramosca	4	2018-02-14	High hope bc of high rating from all the other yelpers. We ordered a special seafood spaghetti and lamb chop.  Why is it special seafood spaghetti?  It is because it included half lobster and crab legs tonight in the spaghetti!  Honestly, there are lots of seafood in the plate, but I would prefer more tomato sauce.  On the other hand, the lamb chop is very good!  Lamb meat is very tender.  At the end of the dinner, the restaurant provide free dessert, which is very nice!
Fieramosca	4	2016-10-29	"I believe this restaurant is an old house - it definitely has that feeling!  The main dining room at the back is filled with tables - a bit too crowded for my taste, but not annoyingly so.  There is also a patio in the back but I believe they have closed it for the season.

The lights are dim, the room has that old world in your grandma's eclectic house feel to it.

The service was just lovely - our server (name I have forgotten unfortunately) was pleasant and FUNNY!  He cracked jokes with us throughout the service which I found nice after a long shitty day at work.  Definitely an extra star for the service.

I ordered the shrimp and mushroom pasta in an olive oil sauce - Linguini DI Mamma Ninetta - this was pretty ok - light and fresh tasting which is what I wanted since I didn't want a heavy cream sauce when I was going dancing later - that would have put me to sleep!.  My only complaint was that the shrimp to mushroom ratio was off - there were only 3-4 shrimp in my dish and it was overloaded with mushrooms.  The portion was pretty big (for me) - enough for 2 meals.

I'd like to check this place out in the summer when the patio opens up!  Overall the food is about a 3 STAR, but the service bumps it to 4 STAR."
Fieramosca	2	2019-07-04	"It is on the $$ side so I expected a great meal. I ordered Spaghetti Carbonara. I can't believe the fatty bacon in this dish. I basically picked out all of the bacon grizzle and ate the spaghetti which, aside from the bacon was good. 

The atmosphere in this establishment is uptight. The tables are too close together, you feel crammed in. It did not make for a very relaxed evening."
Fieramosca	5	2018-11-03	"My favorite Italian restaurant in Toronto. Wonderful service. Elegant, Loud, Positive atmosphere.

I've come here for business dinners and birthday dinners with my girlfriend. It works for either really well. 

No hesitation in recommending it!"
Fieramosca	4	2017-09-17	"Enjoyed a delicious dinner with my mom on a weeknight after catching a fashion show in Yorkville.

We weren't super starving when we arrived so we each opted just for a main. I ordered a delicious glass of sparkling rose which was lovely.

For my entree, I had the mushroom pasta and it was so good. My mom had the veal piccata and loved it. Service was polite and just attentive enough.

Want to come back to try more dishes and some dessert!"
Fieramosca	5	2019-07-07	Had an amazing pasta dish. The pasta was fresh and so was the tomato sauce. The wait staff were all very courteous and kind.
Fieramosca	5	2016-11-04	"Heading out to the ROM for FNL with friends, we wanted some hearty, not to mention tasty, food before our evening out. We were all running a little late, but they held our reservation. I arrived first; our table was at the back and ready. Not a large restaurant as it used to be a home. Classic features and comfortable chairs. So far, so good. 

The rest of our party arrived and our fabulous server was there to take our orders. Another server brought over a complimentary slice of bruschetta while we waited. Mmmmmm. He brought our drinks, a fresh bread basket and went over the specials. They sounded so good, I crumbled and ditched my original choice for the Stuffed Gnocchi with Mushrooms and Sundried Tomatoes in a Rose Sauce($22). My friends ordered Spaghetti Mare Di Mario(seafood in spaghetti for $25), Salisiccia E Quaglia Alla Griglia(4 types of meat for $28) and Bomba Pizza(cheese, green peppers, sausage, onions for $18).  

After the bruschetta and trying to abstain from eating a whole loaf of bread, the food arrived. Hot and smelling amazing. After we were all done taking photos of each other's food, the table fell silent as we dug in. After we all tasted our food, we proceeded to share it. SO good. Healthy portions allowed us to share it without any of us feeling guilty. Everyone agreed my Gnocchi was to die for. The pizza was perfect; thin crust and lots of toppings. The 4 meat dish was polished off. All meats were seasoned perfectly. The seafood pasta had a heap of pasta under those clams! 

We were all so full, dessert wasn't even an option. The wine list was delightful. They offered perfect wines to compliment any meal Fieramosca has to offer.  

Service was excellent. Great timing, didn't abandon us, but didn't bug us. Décor was classic and it didn't feel crowded even though it's a smaller space.  

A great start to the evening! Full and ready to continue our night out!"
Fieramosca	5	2018-09-14	"Very nice quaint Italian bistro known for it's authentic food. The owners close in August to return to Italy and refresh their menu. 
The wine list is diverse from a few regions and wide range of prices. Many great selections that are reasonable. 
The food menu has many different choices of pastas and meats. 
We had the mozzarella and tomatoes which unfortunately was pretty dry and tasteless. Salt and balsamic to sage the day!
My wife had a fusilli with chicken and eggplant in a pink sauce that was excellent. I had the spaghetti with shrimp and chicken with a garlic white wine sauce that I smelled the second I walked thru the door. It was amazing!! Spot on in every way. 
We were sitting for a while talking to a regular guest of the place (3-4x/week) and the owner sat down and talked with us, as she does with many of the guests. After a few minutes she said she was going into the kitchen for desert. She brought out a slice of heaven!! A tiramisu that is to die for!! Light, sweet and aromatic of espresso, of course homemade. A superb ending to a wonderful meal. 
This is a gem of a restaurant. Need reservations."
Fieramosca	2	2019-01-29	"I have one question: who are you people who gave this a 4 or 5 star rating??????
We visited for dinner on Saturday evening. When the server appeared to fill our water glasses using a plastic pitcher we knew it was a bad sign. Most disappointing dining experience. We made the reservation based on reviews. I'm simply shocked this restaurant has a 4.5 rating. The food attempts to be high end fine cuisine but is really just pretending. We had the caprese salad. The tomatoes were large (rock) hard basic garden tomatoes - served freezing cold. The mozzarella was rubbery, not creamy like a caprese salad should be. The arugula was a basic run-of-the-mill salad. Excessive and boring. I had the black cod special. The portion was huge and that was all it had going for it. The cod was served on a big bowl full of under cooked garden vegetables (carrots and cauliflower) with watery-tomato sauce. It was a dish you'd expect at a family restaurant chain. It wasn't served how black cod should be. My husband's excessive serving of orecchette was bland and served in a bowl of liquid. 

The only positive feedback we can share...the martinis were delicious and the server was lovely and friendly. 

It was a cold evening but the dining room was uncomfortably cold and the washrooms were FREEZING.  Yes, it was a very cold evening in the city but this is a restaurant - it should at least be warm. I understand the restaurant has been around for over 30 years - they've had plenty of time to figure out the heating. 

The dining room is old and tired, not in a charming way. There was paint peeling from the ceiling above us. We were seated at a table beside a shelf loaded with about 100 bottles of wine that hadn't been dusted in the restaurant's 30years. I've not seen a worse display of wine.

I loved that it was a family-owned restaurant - that's whey we went. It's low end and overpriced. This is not a Yorkville-grade restaurant. Save your money."
Fieramosca	3	2016-07-03	"You take the good, you take the bad, you take them both and there you have the facts of life... at Fieramosca.  (You are old like me if you know that theme song!)

Have you ever gone to a restaurant with great expectations based on reviews and left disappointed?  That was our experience.

Some call it cozy but for me the table layout in the main dining room is claustrophobically cramped.  If you want a seat on the patio on Friday or Saturday in the summer, make sure to reserve several days in advance.

Reservations are taken by phone and I will admit they were very helpful even if it did take 10 rings for them to answer... I was surprised that a restaurant in this price range did not have online reservations!

Being in a house transformed into a restaurant, the entry hallway is narrow, so if someone is going out, nobody can go in and vice versa.  

So if you are even a little claustrophobic,  be warned, you won't be comfortable here.  

The food:

Complimentary bruschetta:  A plain Pizza crust with bruschetta topping which falls off and wasn't that flavourful. Go to La Bruschetta to find out how it is meant to taste.

Caesar salad:  Crispy romaine, hints of fresh garlic and Parmesan but the dressing seemed watery and the croutons were like rocks.

Bread basket:  Now I know why the croutons are like rocks, the crust on the bread was so hard I was worried I would break a tooth, and I also found it strange to be served whole wheat bread, when I was expecting crusty Italian bread.  

Spaghetti Carbonara:   The reason we came was because Hubby was craving Carbonara and based on great reviews we thought we would try it here but he found Fieramosca's version disappointingly bland, even with extra Parmesan cheese and fresh ground pepper.  

Linguini DI Mamma Ninetta:  I love mushrooms but was surprised that there were so many in this dish... With just 3 small shrimp and a few small pieces of chicken scattered throughout, and very little garlic flavour, this dish was edible but far from great.

Tiramisu:  No coffee flavour!  I have made Tiramisu before and have had it in countless restaurants and I know the lady fingers are to be dipped in coffee before being covered in cream, and these missed the coffee altogether, and the cream here seemed to just be whipped cream, none of the yummy marscapone that I was expecting.   Libretto's Tiramisu in a jar might not be traditional in presentation but has all the flavour that Fieramosca's lacked.  My favourite dessert when done well, I left disappointed.

Lemon Sorbet:  Frozen sorbet in a scooped out lemon, menu says imported from Italy.  I actually liked it better than the sad face Tiramisu so hubby swapped with me because while he usually loves anything lemon, he found an odd aftertaste.  I joked it was the jet fumes to bring frozen sorbet from Italy but the truth is, it was the perfume worn by the woman at the table next to ours.  Thankfully she arrived as we had dessert, so our entire meal was not ruined, but the smell was so overpowering that it gave us both a headache and we wanted to get out of there fast, since with the cramped layout she was almost on top of our table.

Ladies, please don't drown yourself in perfume and go to a restaurant!  Ugh!

TL;DR - Meh. Bottom line nothing was horrible but nothing was great, which for the price was disappointing.  Not worth a second visit.

2 stars bumped to 3 because the service was good.

The search for Pasta Carbonara continues... maybe a trip to NYC or even Rome!"
Blu Ristorante	5	2020-02-15	"Recently came here for winterlicous and we were all left with such a good impression of the place. 

Food, service, location. All great! 

Also, the focaccia bread they bring out with the chilli oil, yum!!"
Blu Ristorante	5	2020-02-13	"Winterlicious 2020 Dinner $53

App: Beef carpaccio 
Main: Beef short rib
Dessert: Pistachio cannoli 

The app was very refreshing and delicious, but it came with a pickled bean which was NOT my taste so I just skipped it. The main was the BEST short rib that I ever had. It was super tender and juicy, the meat came right off the bone! The dessert was good too, I just LOVE pistachios. One thing to mention, although this is fine dining..
 They gave the most generous portion!! I came out STUFFED with AMAZING quality food! 

The staff were very friendly and welcoming. The atmosphere was nice, not too loud and it was a cute little resto. Def want to come back to try their regular menu."
Blu Ristorante	5	2020-06-01	My absolute favourite! Keep coming back for the amazing lamb chops and fantastic service. I've never had to wait to be seated for our reservation and waiters are always prompt and polite.
Blu Ristorante	5	2020-02-03	"This dinner experience  is base on winterlicious 2020. The food was  superb and excellent. We ordered roasted chicken breast and it was moist and  very tasty  while  the beef short rib was soft, like it falls from the bones, taste very good. The serving  is  huge  that I have to ask the staff to pack our dessert. The staff was very attentive to our needs, friendly , polite and  knowledgeable, he explained each item that was on the  menu. The challenge here is the parking, hard to  find, there is a ""P"" parking which is 3-5 min walk but not good on cold weather, maybe for some people  is OK but not for me. I'll come back next time and take UBer."
Blu Ristorante	5	2019-08-20	"I have a very beautiful dining experience here. The staff was very attentive, and Billy the restaurant manager was simply an amazing host. His energy and enthusiasm led the experience to a wonderful memory.

Not only was the food tasty, but the aesthetic finishing of the dishes were beyond excellent. I strongly recommend the Truffle beef Carpaccio; shaved black kale salad; and Roasted butternut Raviolis. 

MUST HAVE DESSERT: Blü chocolate cake

Blü Ristorante is now my new go to in Yorkville for fulfilling my Italian cravings!"
Blu Ristorante	4	2019-09-15	Fantastic service and wonderful dishes. We arrived on a Sunday night at 6pm and shared the entire restaurant with two other tables. It was nice to have a quiet restaurant.  At 7:30pm, the restaurant was half full. The highlight among the dishes was the Apple and Spinach Stuffed Chicken dish. I'd recommend visiting Blu and would come back in the near future.
Blu Ristorante	5	2019-06-25	"I love this venue so much. We rented out the entire place for a VIP dinner after a conference, and they made our group feel like royalty. I wasn't the main coordinator of this event but ended up playing a part in the execution. Every staff member from the bouncer to the bartender was helpful... our guests commented on that, too!

Throughout the evening, the Blu staff proactively looked for guests that needed coat check and showed them the way. We didn't even ask them to do that. Nothing was ""below them"" in terms of customer service. My colleagues and I sat at the bar for dinner because we were tired from event production. We were well taken care of in terms of food and drink.

I had the beet risotto for dinner and tiramisu for dessert. I can't remember my appetizer, but it was similarly amazing. Such flavor and texture. I was floored. Love the prix fixe menu with a few options per course. Not sure if we branded them or they did, but it elevated the experience, and everyone enjoyed their time here. 

We had a projector for some announcements but didn't use it because  conversations were too loud. Good problem to have at a private networking dinner! I can't think of a single thing I would have changed. The restaurant got crowded, but that's probably because we invited too many people. On Blu's side, it was perfect."
Blu Ristorante	5	2019-02-15	"Celebrated Valentines here last night. They had a $99 Prix Fixe menu. Pricey I know. But everything they served was delicious. The servers were very pleasant and explained everything that was being served. There was someone playing live music on the stage (he was amazing). It was just a lovely night. One thing though, because it was Valentines the restaurant was really busy. It took a while to get outlr bill. Normally I wouldn't care but it was getting late (8:30pm) and my bedtime is 9:00pm. Lol! 

If you are looking for a nice classy place to take your date, this is definitely a good spot."
Blu Ristorante	4	2020-01-01	Really lovely and intimate Italian space. The food was quite good and well crafted. The octopus appetizer was excellent. Our server was very professional and seemed to know exactly when to hit the table; he also perfectly handled a finicky member of our party. Would love to return for a date night!
Blu Ristorante	5	2018-12-08	"Got the ahi tuna dish. Really tasty and fresh. The service was amazing too. Had a bottle of wine with friends and it was really good too.

Dark lighting, fine dining... posh place

Bread and dessert were really good too!"
Blu Ristorante	3	2019-09-15	"I'm really not trying to be passive aggressive but honestly, this is my interpretation of this restaurant and the patrons who have rated it so highly.  I feel it received the acclamation it has (voted one of most romantic restaurants in the city and all the 5 star ratings) because (a)  it's in Yorkville and (b) guests MAY mostly include those that don't dine out in the city as often.  The ones that usually do on special occasions

Look, this city has an abundance of fantastic restaurants led by a generation of daring, creative and exciting chefs.  So when I come to Blu, that is a self proclaimed ""fine dining"" restaurant, I'm expecting everything to be elevated.  Not everyone can be Alo, I get it, but it's the expectation that's set which I'm comparing the experience to.  

For starters we got carpaccio, tuna tartar and the octopus. The carpaccio was your typical combination of flavors that I can recite in my sleep (meet, Capers, some creamy sauce, truffle oil ,arugula for garnish.  Maybe not exactly but you know what I mean).  The tartar was tasty from what I recall but the ""octopus"" omg.  First off they seemed to be 2 squid tentacles, very small and burnt.  On one side is a pineapple chutney of sorts and on the other side is an eggplant purée.  It's octopus! Can't really mess that up and don't ever pair is with anything so overpowering. The eggplant ok fine maybe but the Indian flavors did not complement the fish at all.  

On to main course.  My wife had the wild boar ragu.  First couple of bites and you're thinking wow this is delicious but I could see where my wife was coming from when she said the sweetness in that dish is just too much.  You almost get sick of it near the end.  But she ate most of it and whatever it was fine.  I had the seafood pasta.  It was good.  Fresh seafood, pasta and light olive oil sauce.  Nothing extra just what you'd expect I guess.  

The ambiance is great and we loved the service.  They have a nice drink menu and prices were what you'd expect for Yorkville.  

Overall is was a great night and my wife and I didn't leave the restaurant angry.  We enjoyed the food but again it's setting the expectation.  Everything we ate tasted like how they should and we've had those same flavors many times before.  but we were expecting more imagination with flavors and presentation.  Unfortunately Blu didn't deliver"
Blu Ristorante	5	2019-03-20	"Five star for the service! One of our two main orders was wrong. The waiter took both dishes away and remade both dishes from scratch to bring to us again. Now that is a service experience worth remembering! 

Friday evening live music is always a plus too! My salmon was great but I'd definitely come back just for the service!"
Blu Ristorante	4	2020-02-14	Went tonight for Valentine and first off was a little shocked by the fact that a couple of the main courses were changed.  They swapped out an 8 oz. Sirloin for a 6 oz tenderloin stating it was a higher end option.  Thought nothing of it but then desert came and they changed the choice of to a share platter of 4 small items one of which was an unrippened chocolate covered strawberry.  In all fairness the manager came over and saw I was a little bit taken aback by what occured and offered us both a free drink to make it up to us.  Overall experience was nice just hate settling on one menu to be sold a different one.  Would I come again? Definitely but probably not on a set special menu.  A la carte.
Blu Ristorante	5	2019-08-16	Came to Blu to celebrate my birthday with my bf. Everything was perfect. The staff were so friendly and attentive. Our glasses were never empty. Love the recommendations. We really had a wonderful experience. It's a shame that we came too early for the live music but that's okay the ambient was already great. The ahi tuna tartar is a must try and the lamb! It was also really nice of them to give us dessert to celebrate my birthday on the house. Honestly I don't know why I didn't know about this place until recently! Will definitely refer people to this place.
Blu Ristorante	5	2019-11-08	Excellent atmosphere, superior service, wonderful food, great wine selection. What's not to love?
Blu Ristorante	4	2019-10-18	We had the Prix Fixe menu and the Lamb was sooo good. I also enjoyed the carpaccio which was a step out of my comfort zone. The Rabbit Terrine was not that good and we had a bit of the seafood linguine which had nice seafood (the shrimp was so good) but the pasta seemed like you can make it at home with $1 box of pasta. The dessert we had was the Zeppole, Coconut & Lime Cannoli, and the Basil Lime Panna Cotta, I pretty much disliked all of them (still ate it anyways though). Would come again for the Lamb! I usually don't like lamb but this was so good and juicy. I also tried some of the steak which was tougher and a bit burned.
Blu Ristorante	5	2019-03-27	Amazing fine-dining Italian restaurant in Yorkville. On Friday's and Saturday's they have live entertainment which is such a cute touch. Loved the upscale vibes, food and service all exceptional. Large inside with lots of seating. The best beef carpaccio in the city! Would recommend to anyone!
Blu Ristorante	1	2019-06-17	The food was just horrible. The food was bland and the servers told us to try dishes that did not taste well
Blu Ristorante	5	2018-12-01	"Outstanding food and service.  
Great place to take that special someone. 

Live music was awesome.  

James"
Blu Ristorante	5	2019-04-27	The food was sooooo amazing! And the service was extremely good! I went there with my friend, and we both were extremely satisfied!
Buca Yorkville	5	2020-01-05	"We had the duck ragu made gluten free and it was superb. It was so good that we ordered a second plate and shared it between us. Normally I would have ordered it regular but wanted to see what the gluten free option tasted like - did not disappoint at all. Rich, flavourful and if we were not in a restaurant setting likely would have licked the plate clean.

For drinks had a couple of Granatos. Vodka, fresh grapefruit, house made grenadine and bitters.

Can't wait to have both again."
Buca Yorkville	3	2020-02-16	"The entrance was a bit hard to find, since there was no door / entrance off of the main street (where the restaurant's address was). You need to go into the Four Seasons Hotel area, turn left, and it's the last door by the fence (it's right across from the side entrance of Four Seasons Hotel). There's no obvious sign indicating where the restaurant is, until you actually get to in front of the door.

The food tastes good, but nothing too special. Portion sizes of the pasta are a bit on the small side. The vegetable sides are quite good and rightly portioned. Service is attentive and just like in any other higher-class restaurants."
Buca Yorkville	3	2019-11-03	"The food was good. But nothing amazing. We ordered the branzino it was good showed us the fished carved it table side. Great presentation.  Unfortunately it tasted like it was drowned in oil and lacked other flavours. We also ordered cured fish. Most of them tasted good some of them just tasted fishy.

The service wasn't bad. Over it was good had to try pretty hard to get our server a few times.  

Also they have a fruit fly problem inside.  Nov 2019. Half way through our meal we went from having one fly to 10. It wasn't pleasant.  The server were kind enough to move us to a different table and comp us 2 glasses of wine. But still wasn't what I would expect in this type of establishment."
Buca Yorkville	3	2019-09-18	"I read a lot of good reviews about Buca and finally decided to give this top 10 restaurants in Canada a try. 

I came here with my girlfriend for dinner. The moment I came in, I felt like my voice was buried in the noisy environment immediately. It was as noisy as a sports bar and not a good place for chatting. My friend and I had to shout really loud at each other. I can't say I enjoyed the ambiance at all.

We ordered the fish salami platter to share, which came with squid ink bread. The bread looked interesting but taste was just average. For the salami, we both liked the octopus. The spicy flavoured pork blood salami was interesting to me too. 

For main, I had the duck pasta and my friend had the lobster pasta. It took us an hour to wait for the main dish though. We saw people sitting next to us got their food first when they came in later. The duck pasta was very chewy and very tasty (though a little bit salty). The duck had a tuna salad texture which was quite interesting. My friend enjoyed the lobster pasta in general but she didn't like the fact that the noodle being too thin and soft (it's personal preference, though I agree with her). The portion of the food was small but good enough to feed two small eaters.

In general, the food quality was good but missed the wow factor.  Service was average and it was a bit pricy for the overall experience. A 3.5 star rounded down. I will not consider coming back any time soon."
Buca Yorkville	5	2019-07-18	"The burrata pizza from Buca is AMAZING! It's so simple but so good. Perfectly chewy yet crispy crust, super flavourful (but not salty) sauce, and the most amazing cheese.  I usually don't get such simple pizzas when I go out, but this one is fantastic and I highly highly highly recommend!

I didn't love the salumi di mare - it's a salumi/charcuterie plate but instead of meat it is seafood.  I just found that the textures weren't as satisfying, and the flavours weren't as strong as pork and beef meat platters.  It is definitely interesting, and I think it is one of the most popular things to get at Buca Yorkville, since they are the seafood focused Buca restaurant."
Buca Yorkville	4	2019-05-22	"I have no idea how this place has 3.5 stars but I really enjoyed my dinner here. Service was super attentive and detailed, not to mention they kept filling my glass! 

Hands down. You have to get the duck pasta, the octopus, branzino and Italian waffles. All their signatures basically. The branzino was definitely something different!"
Buca Yorkville	3	2019-08-24	"Debated long and hard on what rating to give; ultimately decided on a 3.5, but rounded downwards to a 3! Although I had a great time there with  colleagues, it was really due to the company. The food was decent (neither spectacular nor amazing), but the service was, for the most part, non-existent. It took so long to flag someone down!

We had reserved a table for 10 at 6:30PM, and were seated in a private area, slightly hidden from the rest of the restaurant. To start, we ordered a selection of three salumi di mare. Don't be fooled! While many things here at Buca Yorkville are seafood-related, the salumi does contain some pork options. With the server's recommendation, we got the Soppressata di Polipo (octopus salami which therefore includes pork), Opah (cured moonfish), and I believe the Salmone Affumicato (smoked salmon). Accompanying this spread were gnocco fritto, fried squid ink dumplngs made with pork fat, and two small pieces of pickled onion. The smoked fish was the best and absolutely stole the show! It had a very rich and smoky flavour, and the saltiness whet my appetite. However, the other salumi were just okay.

A must order at Buca is the nodini - these small garlicky bread knots that are little bites of heaven! As my manager says, these are the ""yesdini"". We got two orders for the table, but as the knots disappeared in record time, we ordered another two portions. These nodini really stole the show!

We then ordered our own mains; I got the Polipo e Vongole. A small whole octopus came placed on top of some clams and crispy artichokes, with these al dente small pasta balls (the fregola sarda, which resembles couscous) soaking up the delicious broth. However, the octopus truly fell flat. It was soft, but lacked all flavour - it was bland, unseasoned, and just didn't stand out. For a main that costs $50, I was expecting something a bit more. My colleague ordered the risotto, and was very disappointed as well. It came in an extremely small and shallow bowl / plate, and he devoured it all in the matter of minutes. 

For dessert, we ordered two pairs of three desserts (from the four on the menu) to share:
Tiramisu - This dish barely resembled a tiramisu, and was more along the lines of a deconstructed dessert with a dark chocolate shell and mascarpone cream. It was interesting, but not what we were craving for and wanted.
Pizelle - This dessert stole the show, and was the best! The peach preserve and whipped cream made it appear deceivingly light (although you're well aware it's not, given all the dairy and richness). The presentation was also lovely; when the server poured the ganache over the top, the dessert was just imploring me to take photos!
Torta - I forgot the full name, but this chocolate hazelnut tart served with olive oil and squid ink just completely missed the mark. The olive oil imparted some savouriness to the dish, but the squid ink took it to a whole other level by adding some fishy essence. We left this largely untouched.

The wine assortment here is good, but also pricey (we paid ~$250 for a bottle of red, I believe). If I were to go to Buca again, I'd likely go to the King location for more of the earthy and meaty pasta choices. While this location was decent, it simply didn't meet expectations."
Buca Yorkville	4	2018-11-20	"I love this location of Buca. The service is always great and the food never disappoints. Lovely ambience as well!

Service: although Buca is always busy, the servers are always attentive. Water is replenished often and the servers generally check up often on customers. 

Food: one of my favorite dishes is the duck pasta. It is so rich in flavor. Another item I love is the octopus. Other items are all decent as well.

Overall: 
I will continue to come to this location. The service and food are consistently good."
Buca Yorkville	5	2018-11-21	"Amazing fiancé chose this restaurant- we love Italian. Welcomed and seated right away for our reservation last night. 

Excellent service. Never wanting. 
We split the beet salad. Outstanding. 

My angel hair lobster main dish was expertly prepared. Fiancé had the whole octopus with pearl pasta and charred artichoke hearts. Definitely great. 

Glad we could walk there. Doubly glad to experience this restaurant. 

Our only wish: with such a fine dining restaurant, the bread service should have been gratis. We did pay for the focaccia and it was excellent; however, very few restaurants in this price point charge for bread service."
Buca Yorkville	5	2020-01-17	I'm not sure the others ~ but I went there on my birthday ~ definitely love their pasta and desert~ a little bit pricy because of the location for sure ~ had great memorial  with my family ~ I wasn't the one to order that night ~ so I'm not sure the name of the dishes I had that night ~
Buca Yorkville	5	2018-12-03	"This is one of my favourite places in Toronto for sure. They do such an amazing job with EVERYTHING. Service is always flawless. Atmosphere is classy and cool. 
The menu has so many wonderful things to pick from. Beautiful,well balanced cocktails (they are 17 each mostly, so expensive but so nice). Getting a bunch of items to share is the way to do it. I've been twice now and everything I've ordered has been wonderful! 
Loves of lovely seafood, pasta (the carbonara), the pizza (we had to try truffle one and wow it was wonderful) even dessert is lovely. We had the small doughnuts filled with a Dulce de leche/cream cheese filling. Mmmm soooo good. 

Highly suggest for lunch or dinner."
Buca Yorkville	4	2019-03-04	"This place is fancy and has decent service. Came on a Sunday for brunch and didn't have to wait too long for our table even though we made reservations. 

So it was my choice of giving this place a second chance. A few years back we hit up the king west location and were heavily disappointed with the service and food quantity. Put it this way, we had pizza next door after dinner. 

For brunch the ambience was quite cozy and there was a good view of outside. Our server was attentive and was willing to accommodate for my wife's cheese limitations. 

As a starter we got the black truffle cortini and they were willing to separate in to one without cheese. It was very delicious and heavy in the truffe. Reminds me a bit of France. It went quite well with my cortado. 

For the main I ordered the bison and wife had the duck egg pasta. The portions don't seem like a lot but for lunch it felt quite heavy. The duck pasta was creamy and had a distinct duck flavour to it. Pasta was just right with some chew as well. As for the bison , it felt like dinner. The rich and savory taste made every bite lasting in my mouth. In hindsight I should have paired it with some red wine. Both dishes are highly recommended. We left quite satisfied. One regret is we didn't order the famous little buns. Maybe next time"
Buca Yorkville	5	2019-03-27	"Wow! 
Now I know Italian food doesn't get better than this. The burrata pizza with truffles was like tasting heaven and then coming back, just amazing... I would recommend it to share it with others and try their amazing duck pasta which is super rich in flavour :) also do not forget to leave some space for dessert!!"
Buca Yorkville	5	2019-05-31	"TL;DR Upscale delicious Italian seafood

After trying the other Buca restaurants (which were fantastic), we were not disappointed by Buca Yorkville and can totally see why this place is rated in the top 5 for Canada's Top 100 Restaurants. Its quality and flavours are on par with other top-notch restaurants in Canada. 

Spot prawn crudo 5/5 - started with spot prawn freshly flown in just a few hours before. You can taste how fresh it is with its sweet notes and tender meat. It is absolutely divine.

Nodini 5/5 - One of our favourite classic dishes from Buca. The bread knots are small spheres fried with light salt and garlic. 

Nnocco fritto (squid ink dumplings with tuna n'duja) 5/5 - this was our FAVOURITE dish of the night. We had no idea what it us and took Yelp's recommendation for it. It came with 6 little pockets of bread that you can stuff with spicy tuna and n'duja. The flavour and texture was incredible. Definitely give this a try. 

polipo e vongole 3/5 - this octopus dish is where things fell flat for us. The octopus was cooked with clams and bone marrow. Both the clamps, bone marrow, and stock were delicious and rich in flavour. However, the octopus itself lacked flavour and char. When you bite into the meat, there was no chew or tenderness, felt very mushy and bland. 

Bigoli 5/5 - our second time order the duck egg pasta. This is a must try when you come to the restaurant. The noodles are perfectly al dente and coated in duck offal ragu. If you're weirded out by innards, do not fret as you do not taste the gameyness at all. The sauce is rich and rounded."
Buca Yorkville	2	2019-10-18	We ordered three pasta dishes all of them were mediocre; lobster, vongole and octopus. Lacking flavor and pasta overcooked. Very skimpy on the seafood. Fail. Never again. Not worth the calories. Very disappointed and I'm a carb/pasta whore.
Buca Yorkville	4	2019-07-19	"LOUD diners & superb cuisine

Be prepared for superb Italian seafood at Buca. Enjoyed the appetizers of nodini (garlic soaked mobs of bread) with smoked fish. Moved on the the mains of the octopus (a must) while the family enjoyed cod. Finished with ""pizelle"" a house favourite of thin wafers, rhubarb and white chocolate. Delicious.

Servers were attentive & fast.

What to change to get 5 stars ... the resto was extremely loud so much so that we had trouble hearing our conversation. There are ways to dampen the sound - Buca, give it a try!"
Buca Yorkville	5	2019-10-14	Amazing food! Amazing service!! Best pizza!!! Like amazing the buratta is seriously the best in toronto
Buca Yorkville	5	2018-12-05	"Oh my gosh.  How has this place only gotten 3.5 stars?  We've gone here twice and both times, it has been divine!  We've concluded that we've got some favourite dishes: 

1) Tasting menu - you've got to try this at least once! You literally get the best dishes of Buca including their favourite lobster pasta, which is to die for.  You get seated at the chef's table and you're introduced to drool-worthy dishes, course by course.  It is absolutely fantastic! 

2) MACCHERONCINI DI CAMPOFILONE - aka Lobster pasta
Yes yes yes!  I can have this everyday, all the time, at all times of the day.  Do get this dish if there's ONE thing you choose from the menu. 

3) SALSICCINE - surprisingly, the pizza was just okay.  If I go here, I probably would focus more on their raw and cured selections of meats and fishes as well as their pastas.  I would like to give them another chance on a different pizza. 

Overall, this place is fantastic and a must go.  Definitely do yourselves a favour and treat yourself to a bowl of lobster pasta."
Buca Yorkville	3	2019-07-21	"What's happening Buca? Is expansion over quality influencing the dishes.

Was staying in the area for an occasion and decided to head here for desert here after dinner at The One at Hazelton Hotel. We ordered 3 desert dishes, including their tiramisu. Can't say I was impressed. 

Service as usual was great. 

Repeat:Likely no."
Buca Yorkville	5	2018-10-17	"This was my first experience at Buca Yorkville and I was impressed. I don't get impressed easily as I have been to fancy restaurants since I was a teenager and I started to fly to Paris to -of course visit that beautiful city- but mostly to try some of the best restaurants in the world. I have always been obsessed. I made a casual reservation for a Saturday night at around 9pm after a recommendation from a friend. I'm glad I did. I admit that when our Uber driver left us behind the four season building it took us a whole 5 minutes to find the entrance, as it was raining and for whatever reason I walked up straight to the entrance of the four season instead lol luckily enough the door men there advise me it was just on the other side of the plaza.
But let's get to the deeds of the place:

The ambiance:
Non pretentious but refined

The hosts:
Helpful and very attentive 

The service:
Beyond impeccable

The food:
Sumptuously delicious

The wine list:
The most refined

The bill:
Outrageous :)

Would I go back?
Yes, but most likely if someone's else is paying for my bill please my birthday is coming up."
Bar Buca	5	2020-02-16	"For some reason, me and my girlfriend decided to walk to this restaurant today, which took 45 mins from where we were staying for the weekend. 

I would happily walk that every day for the Porchetta sandwich. 

We walked in and were immediately welcomed with such friendly service. I had the sandwich, my girlfriend the Eggs in Purgatory. 

Firstly, I have to say, the Americano was absolutely delicious. The best cup of coffee I've had in a very long time. 

The Eggs in Purgatory - silky, soft poached eggs, with the tomato sauce being the perfect balance of sweet and acidic. The fresh basil on top was a very nice touch, and served with a very nice bread. Overall, very nice and light. 

Porchetta Sandwich - rich, savoury, crispy porchetta, beautiful apple pieces, silky smooth egg, served with the most brilliant pesto on and incredible focaccia. People, God is real, and he made this sandwich. Every bite was a religious experience. 

We finished the meal with a cannoli each. What a perfect way to top it off. The candied orange added so much to the pastry. 

I can't wait to come back here."
Bar Buca	3	2020-03-09	"I really wanted to like this place. The staff were friendly, and the food LOOKED good.

Alas - not to be.

We came here because my friend was craving their crespelle (olive oil fried pancakes). That was ok - it was a bit greasier than we thought it would be (and I say this as someone who loves olive oil cake) and was lacking in taste. The bombolone sandwich was delicious - the pun was the perfect texture complement to the sausage. And the tiramisu was also super disappointing - it was their ""take"" but was definitely not an improvement.

Damn.

I'd say this is more of a 3.5/5."
Bar Buca	5	2019-11-20	"Okayyyy if you looking for a cute date night or a fun mix and mingle after work, this is the spot! The drinks are pricey but for every drink you get during their version of happy hour you get a token that you can turn in for a small plate of DELICIOUS charcuterie board. We're talking olives, pizza, bread, cheese, pickled stuff, cheese and did I mention cheese? It was delish.

The vibe here is sleek, mod and minimalistic. Really pretty! 

Meg was our server and she was the best! Super helpful, nice, and so smiley! She radiates sunshine and being from California I'm a big fan of the sun! Thanks for all your help Meg, we will be back next time we're visiting Toronto."
Bar Buca	5	2020-02-19	Came here looking for eggs and bar Buca def did not disappoint. The egg with truffle and the pancakes were to die for! We shared all the items amongst three people. Would definitely order less next time as the serving size is very large. 10/10 would go again!
Bar Buca	5	2018-12-06	"Oh YUMMMM. Awesome little place for brunch. 

Overall, the food here is really good - but it IS pretty heavy and tad salty. Olive oil galoreeee. 
- Uova Strapazzatte: Yummy, soft, silky scrambled eggs with some truffle snow sprinkled on top. I would have rathered actual slices of truffle as they used to do instead of this powdery stuff... still tasted good tho! Comes with two thick cut slices of rustic bread, perfect to eat the eggs with. You're guaranteed to have fulfilled your carbs and fat content for the day after this meal LOL. 
- Porchetta sandwich: Really good too! The pork is seasoned very well and it's super tender too. Nice hint of sweetness too from the sauce.

Service was amaaaazeee! They checked up on us and constantly refilled our water. Also did not rush you out the door once you finished eating so you can continue your convo in peace.

We came on Saturday around 11 for brunch and there were no lineups at all, but the restaurant was full tho!"
Bar Buca	4	2018-12-20	"Location/Service
- Intersection of King and Portland, paid/street parking is available around the lot
- exterior might be a little tricky to find as the sign is a bit small
- But interior is quite big, as it resides underneath residential buildings. Love their high ceiling creating more space and the use of its main windows to draw in natural light
- Most of the furniture are high bar top tables
- Staff were friendly and accommodating, helped us squeeze a few seating together during brunch hours so we can have our quick meal

Food
- Italian inspired restaurant, I like how it's an fusion between standard brunch styles mixed with Italian ingredients and cooking methods
- Tried the strapazzate, which is pulled mixed dark eggs with black truffle and burrata ($18)
- Truffles were sprinkled on top but compliments well to the overall dish (not overpowering)
- I like how the egg and burrata (cow milk cheese) were infused together that's easy to taste on the palette 
- Also comes with 2 slices of bread, which was a little bit tough to chew. Adds a nice crunch to the dish if you add the egg on top
- Drink has a cappuccino, which was pretty standard, smooth and creamy

This place does get pretty busy, so do come early or late to avoid the rush. They have a pretty wide selection of drinks, so would definitely come back for dinner to try more!"
Bar Buca	5	2018-12-05	"This place is fantastic! It's a cafe atmosphere that I assume is similar to one in Italy. It's modern with an industrial feel. Tables are higher top and a bit difficult for an older person to reach easily but once seated it was very comfortable.  The kitchen is an open concept for everyone to view the cooks working at their craft. 

Everything is delicious and service is excellent. We started with a delicious non-bitter CafeAmericano! 
While waiting for the rest of our party we enjoyed a ricotta  filled cannoli that was garnished with a candied orange peel. The cannoli shell was very crisp and the ricotta was slightly sweetened. The addition of the candies orange zest improved and completed the melange of flavors. We also, ordered an anise flavored Pizzelle sandwich cookie that was filled with a chestnut cream ganache to share with everyone. It was enjoyed by all. 

Once our other friends joined us, we all ordered from the menu for breakfast / brunch. I ordered the Strapazzate (baked eggs, burrata and shaved black truffle), which was served with freshly toasted ciabatta bread with olive oil and a sprinkling of salt at an $18 price tag. Delicious!!! My husband ordered the Grande Colazione which was a fennel sausage, egg and peppronata plate at $16. The other diners ordered the Al Forno, a baked eggs, buffalo ricotta and pesto genovese dish at $14 and the Tigella a prosciutto cotto and truffled formaggio fresco with egg. This last one was served on a flat bun similar to a small english muffin. It was very small and wasn't satisfying for the diner and this was priced at $11.

Would we return when in Toronto...you betcha!!! Can't wait! BonAppetito!"
Bar Buca	1	2019-10-02	"Very disappointing! Service is very arrogant service. 
We were asking about the menu and were met with cold and short replies as if we are suppose to know everything about this restaurant ... while it was the first time that we are coming to this restaurant. 

The portions are over fried / too small/ and not tasty at all. Pizza is a joke ... it's not event a pizza it is a dough with ...no .. not cheese ... with something g like cheese...
Anyways - waste of time / money / and mood."
Bar Buca	5	2019-06-09	A small space with open designed kitchen. Came here for breakfast and it didn't let me down. Must try the Porchetta sandwich, it is surprisingly good !
Bar Buca	4	2019-05-18	"Great location for a few beers and bar food (Italian stylezzzz) 


The pizzas there are some of the best individual sized pizzas around with quality toppings and even the crust has a great flavour to it, that topped with the bone-less wings is a great bar snack (the wings are boneless except for one bone which serves as a fork of sorts, weird) buuuut the texture and flavour on them wings is da bomb.

Just wish they had some more beer selections, I know Peroni is Italian but I just find it such a standard beer.

All in great place and very reasonably priced!

PS - they have these strange dumpling looking things served with like a tee light and everyone was getting them so imma give that a go too and so should you."
Bar Buca	3	2018-08-06	"Bar Buca was on my Bookmark list for brunch for a long time. Their egg skillet pictures impressed me. We didn't come sooner because my husband prefers a simple brunch menu which comes with eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, toast and salad. So, I had waited for a while until today.  

This afternoon I had trouble choosing which restaurant to have brunch at. We decided when it was 2 pm. Luckily, their brunch time is until 4 pm. So, we came to try out their eggs!  

FOOD (3.75/5)

- LA GRANDE COLAZIONE ($16). The dish comes with two hen's eggs, Italian sweet peppers salad (pepronata) and flatbread (tigella) . We saw the picture of the dish with FENNEL SAUSAGES on Yelp. It interested us and we both wanted to try it. However, I couldn't order the same dish as my husband did. I wanted to try something else also. I had a bite though (sigh). The sausage was small. It wasn't enough for two people lol. 

- UOVA CROCCANTI ($14). The dish came with three crispy duck eggs and topped with Buffalo Ricotta (cheese) and Pesto Genovese. The eggs and cheese were very flavourful. If you like cheese, you will love this. I'm not a big fan of buffalo ricotta. I like the taste but the smell was too strong for me. 

DRINK (4/5) 
We had Latte Macchiato ($3.95) and Americano ($2.90). Both were good. We love coffee. 

SERVICE (3/5)
I don't' really want o say that the service is mediocre. There are many reviews say that their services are great. Maybe it wasn't my day. My server was alright. She answered what I asked for but not really what I wanted. It was my first time and I wanted her to explain to us more about the menu and recommend us what the signature dishes are or what the most popular ones. We also don't know Italian! She said something. Short, and that was it! I could catch that those first few items on Salato section were salad and the half on the bottom were egg dishes, I guess. lol, I was disappointed! I was so excited at the beginning becuase I finally had a chance to come to try the brunch menu at Bar Buca. She just turned everything upside down. - -""

OVERALL (3.75/5)
The place was nice. The host was friendly. I love their eggs but I expect a bit more on their egg skillet and their service for the price. Would I come back again? I still want to try other dishes but I am concerned about their service.  We'll see!"
Bar Buca	5	2020-03-11	Oh my goodness, this small Italian spot is amazing. Just do yourself a favor and go here. I don't even need to say anymore. I had the Gnoccho Fritto and it was absolutely delicious. The service is amazing and the decor is quaint and modern. For my small visit in Toronto, I'd come here every day if I could.
Bar Buca	4	2019-04-03	"Overall: relaxed, casual & loud place - 3.5 stars but the food was so good I bumped it up instead of down. 

I came in for brunch/lunch on a Saturday around 1PM with my friend. We were seated basically right away which was nice. I personally don't really like how all the tables & chairs are super tall, makes me feel a little unstable. The backrests for the chairs were also really small, so you don't have full back support & cant lean comfortably (though still better than no back rests at all).
The server was really nice and explained the menu options nicely; most people come and get the strappazette but I wanted to try something different.
I ended up getting a soupy type of dish with poached eggs & it was honestly SO AMAZING. It's meant for dipping your bread, and it was so rich with taste and texture I was blown away. The bread is also super delicious with just the right amount of crisp and fluffy and LOADS of butter/oil, I ended up having to buy more bread ($2) because my starting ratio was too much bread with not enough of the soup.
Honestly, I was so focused on how amazing my dish was I forgot about my friends... she said hers was good though! I think she got the croccanti, which had fried eggs and some bread as well.
Our server had forgotten about the extra bread I had ordered because it started getting busy and she needed to go to the bar. We had to ask other servers for the bread, twice, and also for more water.
All in all, I'd definitely go back for the food. I'm sad they only serve brunch on the weekends though."
Bar Buca	3	2018-08-27	"I reallyyyy wanted to like this place, I was truly excited to try it. 
The ambiance, the decor and the service were all great. But the food was just average for me. 

I really loved the caffè con zabaglione (espresso with sweet italian custard ) It was honestly the highlight of our meal. The Italian Custard gave it a wonderful sweet taste, similarly to how coffee with bailey's would taste. 

Unfortunately they didn't have many Gluten Free options or Vegetarian options, but we managed. 

I ordered the strapazzate dish (pulled mixed farm eggs, burrata & black truffles ) While to some it might seem like a delicate egg dish, to me, it tasted quite bland and lacked flavour. There was essentially no seasoning in the egg. All you tasted was plain egg with burrata cheese. 

I might come back here for a pastry and a coffee, but not for a meal"
Bar Buca	5	2019-02-28	I adore this place. Everything about it brought me back to Florence, or Venice. Its as authentic as they come. The burrata, short ribs, orange salad, and polpete are all amazing. I can't wait to go back already.
Bar Buca	4	2019-01-04	"Bar Buca is the perfect place to go if you want brunch that's outside the typical eggs benedict, French toast fiasco.

Small cafe with a coffee bar up front. Beautiful interior. The BEST staff. Our waitress (I forget her name) was amazing and checked on us often without being overbearing. She also made conversation with us as we paid rather than just running off with our card.

We both had one of the stuffed foccacias, stuffed with eggs, some sort of pesto sauce, and prosciutto. Delicious and oh so filling. It was so good that I wish I could get the same sandwich here in the states. Their coffee is also very yummy and strong. Definitely a great place to check out if in the area."
Bar Buca	3	2019-06-16	Went for the 4-6 aperitivo where you get a token to fill a small plate with food for every alcoholic beverage you order. Love the concept except wish they had some non alcoholic drinks options as well (not everyone drinks!)... you can add $5 if you order a nonalcoholic drink but still want the plate of food. The drinks are all around $15... a little pricey but expected. Although you can get beer for $7. The food was pretty decent, the flatbread and lemon ricotta were my faves. Service was pretty bad though... no one checked on us. And my friend who came late and ordered didn't get her drink until like 20 min later. No one seemed to be at the bar making her drink until we reminded them and no apologies given.
Bar Buca	3	2018-04-11	"Came here for brunch on Sunday and it was way off the mark. While the ambiance is nice, it was moderately loud and you may be asked to share a table with another group. That didn't bother us really -- the fail point was that they were out of so much stuff and the waitress didn't let us know before we spent a good ten minutes with the menu. No steak. Shoot.

The other failpoint was how their trout brunch menu item is basically like a few bits of fish and citrus. It's definitely not an entree and more of an appetizer. While the waitress did seem to communicate that a tad, I think we definitely expected something different.

The egg dish with the bread was pretty good and tasty and the winner, but portion-wise it also wasn't super filling, but the eggs were perfect. My goat meat focaccia sandwich was decent and tasty -- but I left the meal a bit hungry..I do think maybe we got unlucky with the amount of things they were out of and I do think the chef can cook...I just think the more appetizer-y items should be more clearly labeled and explained."
Bar Buca	5	2020-02-05	"My girlfriend and I have never been to Toronto before, but I found this place not far from where we are staying. We've come here quite a bit in the morning. It's quite good. Good food, friendly staff.. My only complaint is slow service and slow food preparation, but otherwise very good. As a tourist from California I've come here four mornings in a row. That should tell you something.

And try the Arrabbiata! I've had it twice.."
Bar Buca	5	2019-05-04	Bar Buca was the perfect place to come for a nice coffee and pastry.  My wife and I were venturing the city on a Saturday morning and stopped by as my wife loves their Zabaglione Latte.  I had a Zabaglione Espresso which is made with sweet Italian custard.  To compliment the espresso I had a Torta Gianduia (chocolate and hazelnut tart) and the Cannolo (filled with ricotta and pistachio).  Everything was excellent.  Cool decor, casual atmosphere and excellent service.
Fusaro’s Kitchen	5	2020-01-31	This place is one of my go to Italian restaurant if you want some affordable and amazing pasta. I always get the Siciliana pasta because it has a good kick to it with the spicy Italian sausage. I also got the charcuterie board with my friends to try and there was a good variety of cheese (about 3), 2 different meat types, some toasted baguette, olives, grilled zucchini and onions, and some pesto spread. The board was very worth it as a shareable among three people. The pasta portions were very good for its price and it was steaming hot and freshly made. I highly recommend Fusaro's for pizza and shareables. It was great paired with a glass of wine as well!
Fusaro’s Kitchen	4	2019-05-08	"I've passed by this place so many times but never got to try it until now. The outside looked nothing special but the interior gave off a cozy vibe. The food here is pretty good and the prices are fair.

As with most Italian places, we were given a few pieces of bread drenched in olive oil. I like how this place drenched the bread for you instead of you having to dip it yourself because it helps to reduce food waste. But that's just my 2 cents LOL!

To start, we had the calamari fritte which is a fried calamari (pretty much the first thing I always order from any Italian place LOL). In comparison, I actually like the ones from Fusaro's the most because it tasted less greasy than other places. The outside was crispy but the inside tasted really fresh. I enjoyed it a lot and would definitely order this again next time.

For the pastas, I had the Fiorentina while my bf had the Siciliana. The Fiorentina features rigatoni pasta with chicken in a pesto basil sauce. I enjoyed it a lot but actually ended up liking the Siciliana a lot more. The Siciliana is a penne pasta with hot Italian sausage in a tomato sauce. I liked it more because it's more flavourful than the Fiorentina. As a person who prefers more flavourful foods, I was in the mood for something a bit spicy and Siciliana was able to accomplish that. 

I'd definitely come back here again to try the different pastas. I heard pizza here is also good so next time I'll get that!"
Fusaro’s Kitchen	5	2019-10-10	Everything was amazing. Bruschetta, fried calamari, garlic bread, entrees...everything was delicious and came to our table quickly. Great mojito also
Fusaro’s Kitchen	4	2019-10-25	"Really nice Italian restaurant! Small and cozy, young vibe, it an ideal spot for a date, but a nightmare for a big group ;)

The menu is pretty complete, tons of different kind of pasta, from classic to fancy. Fresh thin crust pizzas, salads and everything.

Staff is pretty cool and professional.

We had pizza and pasta, both were excellent"
Fusaro’s Kitchen	4	2018-11-21	"Wow, gotta say I'm impressed with the food here (note: I've only tried their food through foodora so this review will be based solely on their food quality)! We ordered around 15 dishes from Fusaro's for the office - a slew of pizzas, pastas, paninis, salads, and soups. 

I ordered the primavera pasta with the chicken add-on and I don't want to brag or anything, but my dish looked the most appetizing out of everyone's. The vegetables (zucchini, red pepper, broccoli, spinach) tasted really fresh and the chicken is real chunks of chicken which is quite worth the addon IMO. The sauce has a good flavour as well, but wasn't a fan of it being on the runny side. They also added a container of parmesan to sprinkle on top of your pasta, which was a nice touch.

Minus one star because the bread that came with the pasta did not come with any olive oil or butter, which makes all the difference to me."
Fusaro’s Kitchen	3	2018-11-30	"A cheerful relaxed place to grab a large bowl of hot pasta that will fill you up and keep you carb happy. The pasta isn't freshly made (I don't think so at least) but the addition of quality sauces and fresh ingredients still makes it one delicious meal. They make a mean sandwich also! 

Service was relaxed but prompt, probably to keep up with the peak hour crowds. Definitely worth it if all you want is some straight forward Italian."
Fusaro’s Kitchen	5	2018-09-27	"You know what, I have to say Fusaro's has a special place in my heart. They make some rockin sandwiches. I've ordered take out which I actually prefer because the service is very European (slow). 

I always get the uno which has all the great Italian cold cuts and add crispy bacon. It's delicious!  It's crunchy and filled with flavour. I really enjoy it every single time. 

I pick up from here often so you know I'll be back. 

Keep Eating, 
Angela"
Fusaro’s Kitchen	4	2019-12-03	Encountered this cozy and casual Italian spot when hanging out with friends and we all wanted Italian. The food was delicious and the staff were friendly and tentative. It does however, get busier later on during the evening so getting a hold of a staff member will take longer than usual. However, overall a great experience, I would rate this a 4.5/5.
Fusaro’s Kitchen	4	2018-03-19	"I have walked past this restaurant on Spadina so many times but never thought to go in to try it! I can't believe I've been missing out on Fusaro's Italian comfort food. My friend and I had originally wanted to eat dinner at a nearby restaurant but the wait was too long. Checked on Yelp and saw Fusaro's had a solid 4 stars so off we went and I'm so glad we did.

Interior is really cute and cozy... rustic wooden tables as well as string lights dangling across the ceiling. Perfect for catching up with friends or date night.

They have a regular menu as well as a separate one which feature specials. To start we shared the olives which come with a few pieces of bread. Not bad for $6! For my entree I got the seafood linguine and it tasted pretty delicious. Portion was just right for me. My friend ordered a pasta (the name escapes me...) that was supposed to come with capers but unfortunately they missed them in the dish. No worries though because after letting our waitress know she apologized and promptly brought them out on the side.

4 stars is totally accurate for Fusaro's. I'd say the food is about 3.5 (pasta is pasta) but service, ambience, and value is definitely worth that extra 0.5."
Fusaro’s Kitchen	4	2018-12-12	"Fusaro's Kitchen offers great food at reasonable prices. It is one of my go-to places to pick up lunch to go and I also enjoy dining in. The service is very efficient. They are really busy during lunch hours but they are very organized in getting your order through. 

They have great sandwiches and pasta but I personally like their pasta more. I really like the primavera and the acritano pasta here. Overall this is solid place for an affordable meal."
Fusaro’s Kitchen	5	2018-11-12	"Can't say enough about Fusaros! An affordable and delicious Italian spot in the heart of Toronto, it's one of my staples. I've eaten in, taken out, and even come for just a bottle of wine (which is super affordable at $25 a bottle).

I'm a sucker for their bolognese but before I found my go-to I had tried their Italian sausage pasta and a few of their pizzas. Everything is delicious.

It is somewhat on the simpler side but at the price point it's at, I wasn't expecting something over the top fancy. It's essentially a better and more delicious version of the pasta you'd make yourself at home. Which is nice.. that comfort food .

It's also on the smaller side in terms of location size but maybe it's a hidden gem or something - I've never had any issues getting a table regardless of the day or time I've visited."
Fusaro’s Kitchen	5	2019-04-06	Neighbourhood gem. No joke. For those of you who are looking for fast, damn tasty pasta and pizza this is the place you need to come. It's all about the food. Nothing fancy, but good for friends to meet up, or even if you just need to grab a quick meal. A lot of options on the menu and everything is made fresh and delicious. The servers are friendly. There is also a take-out option. Don't need to twist my arm to return here!
Fusaro’s Kitchen	5	2019-05-06	The restaurant was super busy and the service was great! Everyone was socializing with their neighbor tables . The was good especially the apps like the arancini
Fusaro’s Kitchen	2	2018-12-16	"The best thing about this place is the price of the food. Me and my wife went for dinner about an hour and a half before thier closing time on a Saturday night the place was less than half full. We were seated at a table that felt like it was a common walk way by the front door so requested if we could be moved and the waitress refused to move us saying she couldn't offer up a four person table to two people, even though there were plenty and the place wasn't even half full. 

On to the food: 
Bruschetta: bread used was good nice and toasted not overly hard. The tomatoes were tasteless and bland which ruins this dish no matter how good the bread is. Did not taste like bruschetta at all.

My wife ordered the rigatoni Bolognese with a rose sauce. She did not enjoy it at all saying it was watered down sauce with chunks of bland tomatoes. 

I had the penne ala vodka with meatballs as a sub for the bacon my dish was not bad  food came out piping hot, sauce was decent meatballs were small and tasteless.

If you're on a budget, don't care about good service or food quality then this is the spot for you!"
Fusaro’s Kitchen	3	2017-12-10	"I ordered the Siciliana pasta. For the prices that everything is on the menu, it's definitely worth it. We all got a pretty big portion. In terms of taste however, it didn't really blow me away. 

Although the food took quite some time to get to us (30 minutes) the service was great. I had this waitress from Ireland who was quite nice. When I wasn't sure of which wine to get, she also brought me tasters. 

Overall, it's a good place for fairly cheap Italian food but it didn't blow my socks off."
Fusaro’s Kitchen	4	2017-07-29	"I have a vague memory from 2009 of coming to an Italian place in this location, but on a rainy day it was empty.  I remembered it as being pretty decent and thought, hey this place seems like it's in the same spot so it must be the same place!

First off, it was packed at 7pm on a Friday but my dad and I were able to get the perfect table out on the front patio.  Our waitress was really nice and, although she had a lot of tables she was looking after, made good recommendations.

By far the favorite thing I ate here was the warm mushroom arugula salad, which was recommended to us by our waitress (instead of the caprese salad).  It was so good that I'm still dreaming about it today.  The mushrooms were salty and lemony and they coated the greens and warmed them up nicely.

For our entree, we decided to split a pasta and a pizza.  Note from me: skip the pizza!  Our ""marguerite"" pizza was just a very cheesy mess.  It tasted better next day.  It was nothing like a pizza marguerite (and does not look like the ones posted previously on yelp).  The pasta we had was one of the special ones, and I can't remember the name.  Kind of like half moon raviolis.  It was good, but man the sauce was great!  Next time I'd say get an appetizer and then maybe 2 pastas to split ... but skip the pizza for sure.

All in all, really pleasant experience.  Oh, and I had a tiramisu to go.  Was super good.  Only thing I remember not liking about my dining experience (besides the pizza) was the fact that the napkins were paper."
Fusaro’s Kitchen	4	2018-08-15	The patio is a bit cramped, but thankfully the food makes up for it. I tried two of their chicken pastas and both were delicious! The pasta is cooked well, but the sauces were standouts! Plus, you get some bread to snack on while you wait. Service is a bit spotty though.
Fusaro’s Kitchen	5	2018-08-11	"I came here with my mother who loves Italian food. I wasn't hungry the first time I came so watched her eat the vegetarian primavera. I tried some and instantly regretted not having one myself.

The second time I came hungry and tried the spicy pasta with salami I think while my mother stuff to the primavera and it was divine. We were both stuffed by the end of it and walked all the way home to digest our meal. They by no means skim on the butter or cream and that's what made it so good. The sauce was absolutely delicious. 

The service was great too and our server was a delight. Will definitely be back for more."
Fusaro’s Kitchen	4	2017-06-27	"This is a cool little street side restaurant in the heart of China town. Italian in China Town...huh! 

Best panini sandwich that I've ever had I think. It was prosciutto & cheese & it was crunchy, tasty & delicious!! Also the Calamari was absolutely fabulous!! This is a definite do over for me & if you're in China Town...go here!"
Fusaro’s Kitchen	5	2018-05-03	"This restaurant was a huge surprise. A friend recommended it and I'm so glad we went. The storefront looks unassuming but inside are cute string lights and a very warm ambience.

Their appetizers has the usuals, tons of cheese options and calamari. We ordered the antipasto platter and it was huge, we were really surprised because it wasn't expensive. It had meats, cheeses, grilled vegetables, and small sides like pesto sauce and marinated jalapeños. The pasta were all fresh and delicious. It definitely has the homemade taste of newly made sauce. Portions were pretty decent, and I took half of the pasta to go since I had the antipasto already.

The service was good and they gave us water whenever we ran out and packed our boxes to take leftovers. I'd say it was just the right level of service without them watching you or ignoring you.

Overall the bill came to less than $25 for a pasta and half the antipasto platter. So all that plus the great price makes it 5/5. Go to this place if you're ever uncertain of what to have for dinner."
7 Numbers Restaurant	4	2020-02-14	The service was spectacular! Really! You guys impressed me with the level of attention and care. 10/10! What disappointed me was the ratio of quality to the price of food. I paid $26 for the seafood linguine and there were 2 tiny scallops and 3 shrimps. Not good value for the money in my opinion. Grazie on Yonge, in contrast, offers better value for the money. Their prices are lower as well. My wife liked the gnocchi she ordered, but there was no promised gorgonzola cheese. She could not taste it.  The organic wine, on the other hand, was fantastic! She loved it! The calamari appetizer was DELICIOUS! Overall, a mixed bag of FANTASTIC service and mediocre value for the money when it comes to pasta. Next time, I'll go for pork chop or lamb. I'm tired of gluten and carbohydrates. I prefer protein + veggies and some legumes.
7 Numbers Restaurant	5	2019-09-13	"My last Yelp review for 7 Numbers was in 2012 (five stars) and lemme tell ya, nothing has changed in 7 years (save for an added front patio!!). This is still PRIMO rustic Italian cuisine cooked with love by your honourary Italian grandmother, Mama Rosa. The atmosphere is cool, dim, sexy and fun. The service is beyond lovely (hi Tom!)

My faves: lasagna, grilled sardines, meatballs, sexy duck leg, fish puttanesca, grilled shrimp with pea puree, orechiette pasta with ricotta...but honestly everything is so delicious. And the flourless chocolate cake is the perfect end to the meal ...with an Amaro on ice, of course. Enjoy!"
7 Numbers Restaurant	5	2019-06-30	"Authentic south Italian restaurant. The food was cooked by a grandma.

We are a group of 4 came here for a testing menu. $40 person. 4type of salad, 3 types of pasta and each person get their own entree.

The portion was very generous, after the pasta we have no room to eat the entree so we have to pack it to go. Service was excellent, food was excellent."
7 Numbers Restaurant	1	2019-10-25	"Extremely disappointing and mundane. 

Served frozen fish, the lasagna pasta was so overcooked it was actually falling apart and floury. There was not one element of any dishes that I actually enjoyed and while sitting here, I can't wait to leave so I can go to shoppers and get a frozen pizza..."
7 Numbers Restaurant	4	2018-07-28	Very cute and charming restaurant tucked in the Eglinton area. Food was very good - I really enjoyed the duck leg and the beef carpaccio! I like the use of the iPads for menu as well - very convenient and unexpected twist for such a rustic place.
7 Numbers Restaurant	4	2016-11-06	"Family style authentic Italian restaurant. I really enjoy 7 numbers having been here a few times now. I personally think it's a great menu for sharing so come with a small group. 

Service and atmosphere were all good. The restaurant is pretty small and has a bit of a rustic type of feeling to it.

Veal meatballs - 5/5 this is my favourite thing on the menu. Super tasty, eat this with the special hot pepper sauce they have. I think it's perfect.

Lamb shank - 3.5/5 a little bland at my most recent visit but still a good dish

Calamari - 4/5 pretty small portion but fresh

Pasta 4/5 I don't recall which of the 3 choices they have we got but you got could taste the fresh ingredients being used"
7 Numbers Restaurant	3	2019-09-15	This spot is not bad. The room is ok but nothing exceptional nor disappointing. The food is decent but again neither exceptional nor disappointing. Meatballs were excellent but lasagna was served almost mashed in a bowl and just ok. The wine list is mediocre. Service was nice and friendly. P
7 Numbers Restaurant	5	2019-02-03	Our favourite local Italian restaurant. We come here about once a month with the family. Everything has that home made yum to it! We can't resist the pesce del giorno with puttanesca sauce. And the lamb shank...fall off the bone delish. Wide variety of starters and contorni,nothing too fancy. Hubby tried the meatballs for the first time tonight and gave them 2 thumbs up.  The pasta is done perfectly- al dente of course. Even the vegan amongst us tonight left feeling very satisfied. Don't expect to find any pizza here, that's not the vibe.
7 Numbers Restaurant	4	2017-03-12	"""Hearty Italian"" are the two words that spring to mind when I think of 7 Numbers. The servings are generous, the food flavorsome and the presentation simple yet refined. My party of 4 tried the family sharing option whereby you each get to choose your own main dish but are also served with salads and calamari to start, then pasta before being laden with the mains plus sides, by which point you will be hard pressed to finish all the food on account of being so full up. 

The salads were an impressive start to the meal in that being so seemingly simple they still manage to be unique and tasty in their own way (we had spinach with mushroom sprinkled with soft cheese, rocket with red pepper sprinkled with soft cheese, and tomato with mozzarella in a vinagarette dressing). The calamari was also tender and enough for 2 pieces each. Of the pasta dishes the lasagne was by far the stand-out being wonderfully layered, enriched in a delicious tomato sauce and achieving an almost melt-in-the-mouth texture. Unfortunately the smaller pasta shells and brocollini I thought were a bit on the tough side. 

Then with the mains the cauliflower mash is a sizeable portion propping up its two lamb chops, the lamb shank is a mighty sight, and the hunter chicken came as two chunks of chicken surrounded by gravy and various vegetable pieces. Sadly one piece of the chicken was too salty to enjoy. The grilled zucchini was a delightful side to have alongside the meats whilst the accompanying salad I felt had been doused in too much vinegar. 

For a dessert, the nutella tiramisu fills a surprisingly big container - similar to the size of a small plate and certainly something a single person might find a challenge to finish eating, especially after the unsurmountable amounts of food we'd already had, nevertheless if you are up to the task, this dessert is indeed well made and worth a try.

All in all 7 numbers may be a little rough-around-the-edges and go a bit overboard with some of its flavoring but it can offer a wholesome good-value meal, perfect for a cosy night out with friends or loved ones."
7 Numbers Restaurant	5	2018-05-23	"Mamma's meatballs are one of the many reasons to hit this location. Owner  is a reason to visit Danforth location, always entertaining if you sit at the bar :)
The food is always on point at the Eglinton location. The lasagna, rapini, everything I have had is always great and feels like it is homemade and made specifically for you. The atmosphere is warm and inviting, as well as intimate. 
This is more of a southern Italian feel, crusty rolls to wipe your plate after polishing off the saucy morsels in front of you. 
Always a favourite and will always recommend!"
7 Numbers Restaurant	5	2018-04-11	This restaurant is so cute and I am so glad I tried this place out for summerlicious! Everything we had was delicious! The staff were super friendly.  The only downside is that the restaurant is a little cramped.
7 Numbers Restaurant	5	2017-01-31	"I honestly love this restaurant and Mama Rosa, the cook. She is really the star of the show. Her food is delicious, home-style Italian cooking. And the prices are very reasonable, which is something you cannot find too often in Toronto.
The place is always packed and for good reason."
7 Numbers Restaurant	5	2018-11-06	Lovely atmosphere and environment. Always grest food, very flavourful. I just wish the portion sizes were bigger, because the lasagna and veal meatball are amazing. Good value as well.
7 Numbers Restaurant	2	2016-05-02	"Tasty food, but a bit of a disappointment.

I booked a big party for my brother's birthday people. They were incredible about this, they kept in communication with me and were actually able to accommodate 26 adults and 6 babies with a week's notice, which grew to 32 adults, then shrunk back to 26 once we got there. Flakiness. 

We all had the $34 prix fixe, which meant three apps and three pastas shared family style and an individual entree dish. I was sitting at a table with 11 other people, and we didn't get enough food. Each of the sharing dishes was a dinner plate size, shared across all 12 of us, leaving everyone with literally 2 soup spoons full of each item. This was a huge surprise to me as I've eaten at the Danforth location with the same sort of setup - big party, shared plates, except we had the same size of dish for 4 people. 

The other tables in our party (table of maybe 8 adults and 4 kids, and another table with 5 adults and two kids) got the same amount of food, and they were pretty stuffed. We ended up asking for a second portion of the pasta, because it really was a very small amount of food per person, especially considering the price of the meal. The server balked at this, but gave us another serving, which was devoured in a second. 

The food itself was very good (though the osso buco was a bit bland), and for the most part, the service was great, but unfortunately the dinner ended with a table of adults who were still hungry."
7 Numbers Restaurant	1	2017-07-08	"We came to this place attracted by BlogTO's boast of the best lasagna in town. What's a better way to try the place then the Family Meal it has on the menu. For a set price you get to try a little bit of all their well known food.

It comes with appetizers, salads, pasta, and a main course to share.  With all the rave reviews, we thought we were going to have the best meal of our lives.

To note: Their Lasagna was pretty good. It comes in the menu as a small for just under $10 or a bigger pasta size.  I will return just for that.

Everything else, my companion and I were pretty disappointed.  Granted, it should be pretty hard to screw up a salad. Most is just compilation of freshly chopped up raw ingredients.  One of the salads was dressed REALLY sour.  I ended up taking it home and tossing it with more raw vegetables to be palatable.

The pasta sampler plate they provided came with 3 pasta of their choices - this included the legendary lasagna.  It was the ONLY good thing on the plate. One of the pasta was undercooked so it was still crunchy. We had to send it back to be more ""al dente.""

The only control of choice you have was the main dish. We were able to each choose 2 mains individually -  a pork chop and a lamb shank.  That being the highlight of the meal, we were both pretty disappointed too.  The pork chop was way overcook and tough. The lamb shank - well...we had better elsewhere.

We expected a lot more going into the restaurant especially paying over $100 including wine. We both agree afterwards we should had just gotten a lasagna and that's it.

This place was not horrendous but I would not go out of my way to return."
7 Numbers Restaurant	5	2019-02-20	Incredible lasagna, really delicious. Great service. Thank you Tom and Rosa  will definitely return!!
7 Numbers Restaurant	2	2017-02-05	"I can't believe there are such high ratings for 7 numbers. I had high expectations for this place before coming due to the reviews. But it was about a 2.5 imho.

Shared the following with hubby...

Arugula salad with red pepper and goat cheese $12
- This was the best dish of the evening (sad isn't it? It was just a salad). I liked it as the goat cheese was part of the dressing. The red pepper was delish but wish the portion was bigger. A tad small for $12

Veal Lasagne - Lasagne with fresh-made pasta sheets, fresh ground veal, mozzarella, and housemade sauce $12.75 (large)
- Our friends ordered a small variation of this and honestly perhaps we should have ordered the small as well. It looked around the same size except it was on a slightly larger plate. There was too much pasta and sauce and too little meat. My friend called her small bowl a snack size pasta. Very saucy. That ""homemade"" sauce seems to make a repeat with a lot of dishes... But it wasn't that impressive. Tasted like something from a can. 

Meatballs - Big meatballs stuffed with mozzarella, smothered in sauce $13
- I didn't like this at all and let my hubby eat most of it. There was only a small pinky tip size mozzarella bit in it. Wasn't even served hot. Way too much sauce. I ended up dipping bread with it.

As for service, the server who served us was very polite but the general manager Tom? (glasses with plaid shirt) was super rude. Three people could not attend last minute and he said something like if I had known, I would have removed this table long ago (they attached another small table to one end). I think he could have handled the situation a lot better. Thanks for denting the mood of a friend's birthday. We noticed Tom kept giving our table dirty looks as well. At least the food came pretty quickly and our server always made sure things were ok. 

Not coming back again. No one was full and we got wings afterwards."
7 Numbers Restaurant	4	2017-05-31	"Great homemade pasta, so chewy!
Price is really good, decent portion and love the decor/atmosphere. The menu changes every few days. Service is excellent."
7 Numbers Restaurant	5	2017-06-07	"Homemade italian fare oozing with passion and love.  

If its in the revolving menu that evening, do get the veal sausage.  Its wonderful, juicy, and very tasty.  

Make sure to try the veal meatballs, the eggplant parmigiana, and the almighty Lasagna!

Basically, you cannot go wrong.  And ask for the hot peppers on the side.  I wish they sold these!!!

Ambiance is casual/romantic.  Very good food without the pretension.   10000 stars if I could."
7 Numbers Restaurant	4	2014-12-08	"I had a very, very lovely evening here last night - the memory of the flavours makes my eyes roll back in my head!

I was brought here as a surprise for our second anniversary because Sweetheart knows I'm a huge Italian food fan, and he wanted to bring me to an authentic place.  At most Italian restaurants, I just order pasta, because the meat doesn't really interest me that much, I love my carbs, and especially because usually the pasta is more than enough to fill me up - especially if I want any appetizers or desserts.

But here at 7 Numbers, they do it the right way - the portions are smaller because they're designed to be eaten through, and the prices reflect that (very reasonable prices!).  So you're supposed to have an antipasti (appetizer), a primi (pasta course), and secondi (meat course) with contorni (side vegetables, usually in the form of veggies).  

I was eyeing the fixed price menu but I had a picky eater with me, so we decided to pick everything out ourselves.  We got the calamari, a large lasagna portion, the rapini linguini, the sexy duck leg, the grilled pork chop, and we got a slice of the flourless chocolate cake to go.

The calamari was delicious!!!  It was very generously seasoned, cooked just right, and came on a bed of assorted lettuce.  We squeezed the lemon slice it came with over it but I kind of wish we didn't because the coating on the calamari was the kind that wilts as soon as it hits liquid.  But it was very, very good and the lemon went very well with it.

The pastas were really something to write home about!  They were quite salty to me, which means Sweetheart found them perfect, and they were cooked a little longer than I liked, but the flavours were just wonderful.  The rapini linguini was beautifully garlicky and olive oily, and the tomatoes in it were magically not acidic.  The bitterness of the rapini cut through the richness very well.  The lasagna was very, very hearty and rich.  At first bite I kind of thought the sauce was too acidic but once you have it with the meat sauce and the cheese inside, it's perfect.  The tartness of the sauce goes perfectly with the meat sauce, which must have been cooked for hours!  I need to re-emphasize how rich and almost heavy the pastas are - the portions are smaller, which is perfect, but if anyone's squeamish about seeing a puddle of oil at the bottom of their plate, this pasta is not for them!  

The meats were good but not as impressive as the pastas.  The sexy duck leg was encrusted with rosemary, which made it taste very herbal, but it was very good.  Kind of small though, and quite salty - but good.  The grilled pork chop was delightfully thick and succulent - as juicy as a grilled pork chop could be!  But the braised onion/pepper garnish it came with DELICIOUS.  It was super savoury, kind of like they were lifted out of a super flavourful stew, and they melted in my mouth.  Delicious.  The grilled asparagus was just right - they tasted like high quality oily oil, they were crunchy, they had the delicious grilled flavour - very nice and basic.

We saved the flourless chocolate cake for home because we didn't want to skip it but were too full to have it right away.  It was dense and chocolatey and sweet without being too sweet.  Very good.

Our server was also quite pleasant and patient with us despite our questions and indecisiveness!  I'd love to come back again and I hope to join the cooking class one day! :)"
Famiglia Baldassarre	5	2020-01-30	"All you need to tell me is that there's a secret pasta warehouse serving up the best pasta dishes in Toronto and I will obviously be there. Baldassarre has been supplying many of Toronto's restaurants with traditional fresh pasta of the highest quality since 2010. But you can also go to eat it directly from the source: Leandro Baldassarre's brick warehouse in Davenport. Toronto Life put them at #97 on their The City's 100 Best Restaurants 2018 list. And blogTO named them as the #1 Best Pasta in Toronto.

It almost sounds too easy, but it's not. If you want to try this pasta you're going to have to work for it. (It'll be worth it.) They're only open Tuesday to Friday from 12-2pm. Yep, that's a weekdays-only two hour window. Plus there are only ten seats in the whole restaurant. I got myself all prepared to do this thing on a Tuesday afternoon and rolled up to the manufacturing strip of warehouses around 11:45am. There was already a lineup of around 15 people deep. I added myself to said lineup. One last hoop to keep in mind is that they are an entirely cash-only operation. You've got this. Arrange your life and go eat some pasta!

Once the doors opened at noon it took about 20 minutes to get myself through the queue and up to the counter. While the space is certainly factory-esque, it's also quite bright, airy and fresh. There's a shelf full of merchandise for purchase, four marble tables available for dining, and the rest of the room is their factory space full of staff members busily working away and rows of pasta being produced. The menu changes each day and the current offerings are posted chalkboard-style. You can take your eats to-go but if you choose to eat in the restaurant then you will need to wait for an available table. A staff member will take your phone number and call you when a table is free. I did this and the wait to be seated was only about 15 minutes - faster than I expected. Once seated, my name was called as my dishes became ready.

The menu is very short. Two different pasta dishes are offered daily. In the small Contorni section (side dishes) there was Fior di Latte (housemade mozzarella balls), Crudo (raw) prosciutto, and a vegetable dish; Cetrioli (field cucumbers). They also offer some Italian sodas to drink and a Dolce (dessert). Taxes are all included which keeps the prices very straight forward.

Of the side dishes, I very nearly ordered the Fior di Latte, but at the last second found myself asking for the Crudo 24 month San Daniele D.O.P. ($9.00). I couldn't say ""no"" to a gorgeous plate of one of the most prestigious varieties of prosciutto. The D.O.P. stands for ""Protected Designation of Origin,"" a title which is only given to products that depend solely on the area in which the meat is produced. In this case, the meat comes from San Daniele, a small village in Italy's northern region. The taste and texture of this prosciutto was incredible - likely the best that I've ever tasted. A beautiful saltiness permeated the delicate ham and each bite melted in my mouth. I could certainly tell the difference from a cheaper variety, which can sometimes be stringy and chewy. This meat was none of those things, providing a luscious mouthfeel. Sorprendente!

It was clear to me that we would be ordering both pastas, and that's exactly what we did. First, Tonnarelli al Cacio e Pepe (Pecorino + pepper - $13.00). One of my favourite pasta dishes, I was very excited to find this one on the menu. This Roman dish is simply made with cheese and pepper and it is certainly an example of how the most perfect things are the most straight forward ones. The tonnarelli used is an egg pasta from Lazio (the region in which Rome is located), quite similar to spaghetti. I have eaten this dish in Rome and I have to say that the version at Baldassarre is pretty close to identical. Their pasta was served perfectly al dente with a little bit of a bite. The liberal application of creamy pecorino and sharp pepper produced a beautiful plate that must be tasted.

Next, Perciatelli a la Matriciana (Guanciale, tomato + Pecorino - $14.00). Perciatelli, otherwise known as bucatini, is a thick spaghetti-like pasta with a hole running through the center. It's one of my favourites! Matriciana sauce is essentially a classic meat sauce based on guanciale, cured pork cheek. I really loved this dish and found myself having moments lost within the sublime simplicity. I would've liked for it to be even saucier, however I did appreciate that the pasta itself was the star of the plate.

I should also mention that Baldassarre provides complimentary crusty Italian bread that you are more then welcome to help yourself to. An excellent and necessary item for sopping up every last drop!

While eating at Baldassarre is a bit of an ordeal, I do think that it was worthwhile. I found the prices very reasonable for the level of food quality. They sell their pasta and sauces as well, so you can keep the delicious eats going at home. If you'r"
Famiglia Baldassarre	4	2020-02-09	"Took other yelper's advice and came at 11:30am on a crisp fall Friday. There were approximately 15 people in front of us, but the line doubled within 10 mins of us arriving. There is a coffee shop right next door so you can grab a coffee whilst you wait in line.

Once they opened their doors at 12, the line moved relatively fast. We placed our order within 20 mins of them opening. However because we wanted to dine in, we waited for an additional 10ish minutes. They gave us a call when a table was available. I do not recommend coming with more than 3 other people.

My boyfriend and I ordered fresh mozeralla, Parma ham (16 months) tagliatelle in ragu, ricotta-spinach ravioli in butter and parmesan.

Maybe my anticipation for the fresh mozzerella caused high expectations as I found the cheese mediocre. It was on the firm side and did not have the smooth- chewy texture I was expecting. However, it was quite milky.

For $6, they gave a generous portion of the parma ham. The ham was well cured, it was not overly salt and did not have a raw meat taste.

The ravioli was my favorite dish. The butter parmesan sauce was addictive and thinly coated the ravioli. The filling to pasta ratio was good - it had enough filling to puff up the ravioli yet it did not burst easily. The pasta was cooked al dente.

The tagliatelle ragu was quite good. The tomato from the ragu was a bit tart which kept the dish light. However, I do wish they gave us more sauce.

The staff were polite despite the constant line up out the door for 2 hours. Next time, I hope to try their burrata."
Famiglia Baldassarre	5	2020-01-07	"A hidden gem, that I hope will stay hidden for a little longer until I get my fill. Is that a terrible thing to say? 

With their limited seating and limited hours of operation, you have to plan your visit at Famiglia Baldassare. I decided to trek over on a random Tuesday I was home, a little sick and miserable. 
I got there around 12:10, and all the seats were full, and there was a small group of people waiting for their take out. I got to order right away (one of two pastas on the board) and it was about a 10-15 min for the food.

As I waited, I watched them roll out sheets of pasta, work on dough, and just working in unison in the open kitchen - it was mesmerizing. 
I can't remember what I had, but I attached a picture. I don't think you can go wrong trying every item on their menu - seriously. The pasta was perfectly al dente, lightly sauced and simply delightful!

Writing this is making me want to work late and take a long lunch tomorrow ;)"
Famiglia Baldassarre	4	2019-10-07	"I've known about Famiglia Baldasarre for a long time, but have never been able to make it here for a weekday lunch, especially since the location is far and random. Well, I finally made it here with a friend visiting from SF. First, there will be a line, but it moves quick. Second, this place is CASH only, hit the ATM before coming. Third, take a look at the menu while you are waiting in line so you can order as soon as you reach the front. 

The two of us ordered the parma, tagliatelli in bianco, tagliatelli al ragu, ravioli in rosso and Bar Ape gelato bars. I admit everything was very fresh and delicious, although my clear favourite was the tagliatelli in bianco. The mixture of cream and butter was pure heaven. I also really enjoyed the parma ham. They offer free bread, which you must try. Whether you eat it with the parma or to clean up the pasta sauce. 

I even ordered fresh tagliatelli, pumpkin and corn ravioli and a pasta sauce to go. It might be awhile before I get to return. 

*If you forget to bring cash, there's a Nova Era bakery nearby with an ATM machine."
Famiglia Baldassarre	4	2019-12-10	"I don't think I could add to what others already said.
I can say prices include tax which is great. Portions are reasonable. I was at Sugo several times now and as a comparison, I don't think Sugo makes their pasta and the portions are bigger. But here you are getting quality over quantity. Pasta is made fresh that day.  So if that means anything to you then, you will make the trip.

It took 40 minutes for us to get our take out food. Went on a Wednesday. Arrived before lunch and left at 12:40pm.

They are taking Xmas orders. Order by Wednesday and pick up Saturday.

I'd like to go back"
Famiglia Baldassarre	4	2019-11-14	"Quick things to note: Long wait. Bring cash. 

Famiglia Baldassarre brings a popular crowd for lunch, especially since they're only open 4 days a week and only serve for 2 hours a day. We got there around 11:30 and placed our order around 12:15. We were going to sit in, but was told it would be another hour wait. So we decided to do take out and just eat in the car. They do have tables outside, but it was cold and also those tables were taken. We got our food not long after around 12:30. 

We went on a Friday, which had tagliatelle and ravioli on their daily menu.  The tagliatelle was with a nice ragu sauce and the ravioli was with a butter and parm sauce. Both were really nice and fresh and quality is no question. We also got a side of their parma ham and fior di latte cheese. 

Everything is priced very fairly, so if you're a person who will probably just come here once to try, I'd get one of everything! 

I think it is definitely worth visiting and trying, but I don't know if I would go again. For the prices, maybe, but for the wait, maybe not."
Famiglia Baldassarre	5	2019-07-13	"Famiglia Baldasarre has become quite the institution in Toronto. There are always massive lineups - rain, snow, or shine - but the food is always well worth the wait, unlike some not so great hyped up brunch and ice cream places in the city. I usually get there at 11:20 if I want to try to get a table, or slightly later if I want to bring it home (and end up third or fourth in line). The area is becoming quite a 'food' destination even though it's a bit far out of the core. There is plenty of parking though on the many side streets. Daily menus are posted on their Instagram stories usually an hour or two before. They are usually only serving from 12-2 on some weekdays. 

Once you get in, the food comes relatively quickly - they've got a well-oiled machine to handle the crowd. The food is priced well relative to portion.  I have loved everything I have tried, but my favourite so far is the ravioli with truffles, but I've never made it yet for cavatelli Wednesday, so there's still more to look forward to. I can't wait for my next weekday off."
Famiglia Baldassarre	4	2019-12-31	"Went there on Dec. 31st at lunchtime and lineup was ridiculously long. We had to wait two hours before we were able to sit down. Having said that, I would say that the wait is worth it, as the pasta is really at a whole another level, better than any other place I've tried in Toronto (and even Italy as a matter of fact). 

We had the tagliatelle with the ragu sauce and the spinach/ricotta ravioli with the blanco sauce (with truffle and parmagiano cheese). Both dishes were amazing, however, the true outstanding item on their menu that day was the Fior Di Latte: the mozzarella ball was prepared in the morning of the same day. We also ordered the Parma ham appetizer (cured in house for 16 months), which was also good, but nothing to write home for...

All in all, I highly recommend this place, but just  don't go hungry, as you will have to wait for a long time (There is only sitting room for 10 people inside). My only complaint about this place is their opening hours, they are only open for lunch four days a week (and sadly, they are not open on the werk"
Famiglia Baldassarre	4	2019-06-07	"Finally came here on a Wednesday to try this unassuming fresh pasta place that I've heard so much about! It's tucked into an industrial area that isn't easily accessible (was literally a 40-min subway ride from downtown Toronto), and nested between some buildings. It's actually located next to Dark Horse Espresso, which is likewise hidden. 

My friend came here earlier than 12PM (which is when it opens) to line up, so we didn't have to wait long. In fact, even when I arrived shortly after 12, there was a line forming, but it was only about 10 people. As we didn't want to wait further, we decided to get the pasta for takeout. Since we don't need to wait for inside seating in the tiny communal area, we were therefore able to get our order faster. 

The server taking orders was super friendly, and provided great service. He had a welcoming smile and warm tone, and was able to banter casually and really well with the customers. It's an open kitchen, so you're able to see the chefs make the pasta and cook your order. Super cool!

My friend and I placed one order each of their two daily specials, and waited for about ~5-10 minutes before our food was prepared. After getting some bread from the corner to sop the pasta sauce, we grabbed a seat outdoors and dug promptly into our food.

The pasta of the day was cavatelli, and it came with either a lighter rapini / anchovy / pecorini dressing or a richer sugo and sausage tomato sauce. The first one, con cime di rapa, was honestly so good! It had a nice flavour to it - slightly salty from anchovy, and the generous amount of greens really helped to brighten the dish. The cavatelli was perfectly al dente, though I did find some pieces to err on the side of being a little under-cooked. However, if I were to choose, I did prefer the tomato-based con sugo e salsiccia. It had more depth to it, and was just heartier! For $12, the pasta is a steal. The portions are also super generous, which is great (I had enough for the next day)!

Although we were able to save time from eating out, I would likely opt to eat-in next time. The experience is just better when you're dining on plates and not from a take-out container. Also, I found my pasta getting cold and hard even a couple minutes in, likely due to the wind and exposure from the air. It wasn't a perfect experience, but that just gives me more reason to come back! Looking forward to trying the cured meats, which looked so appetizing and delicious from afar...."
Famiglia Baldassarre	5	2019-04-18	"This place is 4.5 stars. I only wish they open more days and longer hours. Definitely hidden gem of the city; they only served lunch from Tuesday to Friday, noon to 2pm or till sold out. Not good for big group, 10-seat only. Highly recommend to get there early if you plan to dine in since line has been formed as early as 11:30am. If you cannot get first 10 seats, you can order and leave your number with them and they will call you when a table is available. 

Upon entered the space, you can smell nice aroma like you are coming home with delicious home-cook food. Limited daily menu is written on the Blackboard or pay attend to their daily Instagram story. Everything is very reasonable priced; actually I should say is a steal!!

During our visit, we tried Tagliolini (egg noodles with butter, rosemary and porcini mushrooms), Cappellacci Verdi (green duck filled with butter and duck braise), Fior di Latte, Crudo (San Daniele D.O.P. 24 month). 

I love every single dish; they gave a very clean and simple taste like home made food. My favourite is Tagliolini; the egg noodle is so bouncy, al dente with nice eggy taste. The mushroom is so aromatic and fresh. Fior di Latte and Crudo are very tasty and flavourful. Cappellacci is very nice with very rich duck flavour. 

I wish to come here more often!! Love this place very much!!"
Famiglia Baldassarre	5	2019-12-28	"So we had to wait, but I must say it was totally worth it. We ordered 3 of the 4 pastas they had available that day, and we didn't regret it one bit. After waiting about 30-40 minutes, we luckily got a little table right inside to dine in. We could see the chefs freshly making the pasta and cooking our meals at the same time while almost drooling to get it. 
We order the black truffle with tagitelle pasta, the bolonese with tagitelle, and red sauce with spinach and ricotta ravioli. All were just divine, and so worth the wait. Everything from the freshly made pasta, to the flavorful tomato sauce, and the freshly grated truffle was to die for. Ravioli filling and the red sauce was my favorite dish. 
Definitely 10 outta 10."
Famiglia Baldassarre	5	2019-04-16	"Famiglia Baldassarre is located on Geary around Dovercourt/Dupont. It is hidden in an industrial area and has been one of the most talked about places in Toronto for pasta! They also supply the pasta for a lot of Toronto's top restaurants and chefs. Only downside is that they are only open from Tues to Fri from 12pm to around 2pm for lunch. You can also buy their fresh pasta as well to make at home. I finally had a chance to try Famiglia Baldassarre on my day off.

Famiglia Baldassarre has a small space for eating in (4 tables, 10 chairs); I shared a table as I had come alone. What's great about the space is that you can also watch the staff busily making pasta and other delicious items. The changing menu is posted on a blackboard and uploaded to their IG stories. Usually there are 2 kinds of pasta dishes and a variety of smaller dishes (beets, burrata, etc.), as well as drinks.

I arrived at Famiglia Baldassarre on a Wednesday morning at around 11:15am where I was the 2nd in line (did not have to wait). How it works is that you order at the counter before finding a seat. The sign at the door states that you must order before finding a seat so that you don't bud the line or hold up a table. That day, I ordered the cavatelli with rapini and anchovies. I also ordered some fresh burrata cheese. The burrata cheese was to die for - very fresh and delicious with the free bread that they provide. The only thing missing was a glass of wine! The pasta itself was super fresh, al dente and had a good texture. The sauce was not heavy and it coated the cavatelli well. 

Overall, friendly staff and delicious food. If I ever have the chance to have a day off again, definitely would line up for Famiglia Baldassarre again!"
Famiglia Baldassarre	5	2019-07-01	"ugh i love this place so much but why is it so far and randomly located?!

If this was located in downtown Toronto, you can bet I'll go on a pasta diet for this place. Their pasta is insanely fresh (and you can see the team in the back cranking them out) but that also means it sells out fast.

I came 10 min before opening and there was already a line. By the time the store opened, there was a solid line building up behind me. You order at the cashier and they'll ask you if you're to-go or for here. If you ask for it for here, the nice thing is they won't make your pasta until there is a table ready. You can't sit until your food is ready which is nice in a way because no one can reserve the seat while their party is miles behind in the line. Once you are seated (if you're for here), your food will be ready in another 5-10 min.

A few helpful facts:
- This place is cash only 
- They change their menus pretty consistently 
- You should 1000% buy some extra pasta to bring home even if you're not sure because by the time you finish your pasta and decide you want to bring some home, the line will be insane and maybe sold out by the time you reach the counter
- They have complementary bread which is just as good
- I don't need to recommend any dish here because they'are all A++ so order what your heart wants and I can promise you it's going to be incredible!"
Famiglia Baldassarre	5	2019-05-17	"0 stars for not accepting card, for such restrictive hours, and for the limited seating capacity.

But a million stars for everything else, especially the food. So on Yelp's scale that's like 5. Likely in my top 3 places to eat in Toronto. Bring cash. There's a TD and BMO at Dufferin Mall and a CIBC by Ossington Station. Stay on top of their Instagram stories for special dishes/menus, collabs, extended hours, and just pure pasta porn. Everything is good here and you'll do well if you at least order one of everything (bring a friend if this isn't possible solo). Order to go and eat outside if you're not willing to wait for a table indoors. Do not seat yourself as they keep a queue and will time your orders accordingly, and will direct you when it's time. Grab a couple slices of the complementary bread as you'll want to mop their flatware spotless. There's probably not much else I could tell you to help you prepare for the absolute treat that is Famiglia Baldassarre."
Famiglia Baldassarre	5	2019-09-07	Unbelievably fresh, made in front of your eyes pasta ! Service was exceptional ! Although they said restaurant closes at 2 pm - they never stopped serving everyone that stood in line. Favourite was the stuffed ravioli !
Famiglia Baldassarre	5	2020-04-09	Loved their pasta. We had the Paccheri pasta; so fresh!!! We also got their baseball sized mozzarella cheese ball & OMG that was amazing. It was soft, not chewy, smooth and creamy with light flavor. I cannot speak to their prices, customer service, or the environment; but, Thank you for supporting Healthcare workers!!
Famiglia Baldassarre	5	2018-10-02	"I have to confess I am a pasta monster. I would be happy eating lunch everyday here at Famiglia Baldassarre for the rest of my life. Sadly they only open 4 days a week.

Arrived early before the place was opened on a overcast chilly afternoon. The wait was minimum and we got to order the 2 pasta of the day, a Crudo and Asparagus to share. 

Nothing can replaced the taste, the mouth feel of freshly made pasta. Their menu changed daily so you always in for a treat and wondering what you going to have for lunch today.

The Prosciutto crudo is a steal at the price. Must order! 

Sometime truffle might be available? Truffle is just magical.

Everything tasted so fresh, pure and wholesome. A taste of love and caring prepared by an Italian mamma?

Just go and you find out what you had been missing in your life. Make sure you bring Cash!"
Famiglia Baldassarre	5	2019-06-26	"Arrived about half an hour early before opening as suggested by other posts. Peeking into the window, I saw the staff meticulously working to ensure everything is ready before doors open. A line slowly built up behind me, and come 12pm, there was about 15-20 people waiting.

There are exactly 10 seats for dine-in, so if you want to have first seating, come early. Otherwise, there are several picnic tables on the patio.

I ordered the cavatelli with sugo and homemade sausage, and the insalata (radish, cucumber, cubed lettuce) for dine-in. I also got agnolotti to take home. The pasta was cooked perfectly, with each cavatelli holding the sugo like a glove. The sausage was juicy and flavourful. The insalata was refreshing between bites of pasta.

As I was enjoying my meal, the line never got shorter. The man who took all the orders was friendly and never lost his cool in the busyness. After I finished my food, I asked for my agnolotti. The man offered serving suggestions and cooking instructions.

I made the agnolotti the same night with a brown butter sage sauce.

Definitely would come back. Well worth coming early. Best pasta. Best value. Great experience."
Famiglia Baldassarre	5	2018-09-05	"***Note:  CASH ONLY!!!***

***Note:  Lunch service is only 'til 2pm or when portions are sold out.***

TIP:  Join the queue BEFORE this place opens at noon to miss the lunch time rush!  Otherwise, reserve at least 45-60mins to wait in line, wait for your food, and then finally eat it.  

A true thing of beauty!  Is it a mere coincidence that it's located in a building called, ""Artisan Factory""?  I don't think so!

All the fresh pasta, burrata/stracciatella, & sauces are made in-house.  Baldassarre supplies a lot of major Toronto restaurants with their fresh pasta.

Dining area itself is TINY!  I counted 4 small-ish tables of 2-4.  Other than that, you're getting takeout.

Daily menu is posted on a blackboard.  Menu items do sell out, so get there early!  They were serving cavatelli with 2 sauces ($12ea!!!), and naturally, I got the sugo with a sausage.  Sugo had a nice kick to it!  I had no problem eating the entire thing.

This is NOT a joint for someone who's pressed for time, but soo worth it!"
Famiglia Baldassarre	5	2018-09-27	"Wow. Fucking amazing pasta. You can really taste the quality of the ingrédients... it's insane how good it was. 

If you're coming here, come early as the line can grow to at least an hour. There are maybe 5 or 6 tables, so not a whole lot of room. 

I'm waiting to order while watching people make and design the fresh pasta, it is beyond cool. The menu is always changing and I will be back. 

The freshest pasta I've ever had, and again everything was so simple and fresh but so delicious. 

Keep Eating, 
Angela"
Grazie Ristorante	4	2020-01-01	"grazie

lovely italian place on yonge! ive been here a handful of times but never got to writing a review yet. i gotta say, every visit has always been consistent in terms if the amazing food & friendly service. 

a solid 5/5 for service.all our visits here are always pleasant. i dropped my utensils seconds after ordering, and a gentleman swiftly replaced it for me, w.out me having t wave someone down and sit there in embarrassment. ive been to establishments where they roll their eyes and sigh out loudly in annoyance. well, not at grazie! i think every staff member was always smiling and laughing!  it creates such a warm atmosphere and a pleasant dining experience. 

food 4/5 almost all the dishes we have ordered here are so delicious! occasionally a dish may be a tad too salty but overall, everything here from appetizers to mains and desserts  are always a crowd pleaser. 

pear salad 4/5 
refreshing, light, great dressing.

pizza 5/5
chewy crust, simple tomatoe sauce.

rigatoni pasta 5/5
really good bolognese sauce. we loved this dish the most!

feature lasagna 4/5
classic layered pasta and meat sauce, just a tad dry.

feature soup 3/5
assorted mushroom puree. it was lacking a lot flavour. literally tasted like puree mushrooms and water. some onions, garlic and a pinch of salt wouldve gave it more flavor & depth."
Grazie Ristorante	3	2019-12-14	"This restaurant was fantastic dealing with some menu modifications that allergies required. Usually there is pushback from the kitchen but not this place. For that we are grateful. 

The modified meal was good, well cooked and an ok all round meal. The pasta in both meals was properly cooked and fresh. The veal however, not as good. It had large sections of charred burnt meat and was quite dry. 

Overall, the service was great, food...mediocre."
Grazie Ristorante	4	2019-12-11	"I'd been wanting to try this place because every time I passed by it was always packed with people even after 8. 

After I tried, I can say that it's not the place you would die for, but I do recommend and would visit this place again because it's definitely bang for the buck. 

I tried their Margherita pizza, and three different pasta dishes including gnocchi (can't remember the names of the other two - 1 seafood, 1 mushrooms). I especially enjoyed gnocchi, and the other pastas were also good but a little salty for me. 

Overall, a good place for a casual night out and affordable price for good meals."
Grazie Ristorante	5	2019-10-02	"A Yonge and Eglinton staple. This Italian restaurant is always bursting at the seams with customers and loud laughter. And there's a good reason for that - it is truly delicious. 

While not one of the fancier Italian restaurants in the neighbourhood, this restaurant truly lives up to the hype with their incredibly long selection of menu items and the amazing quality of food. 

My go-to dish is the Bosco pasta. Creamy, filled with a variety of mushrooms, and topped with fresh rosemary. Absolutely to die for. Their gluten free corn pasta has the same consistency as regular pasta and tastes delicious!

I love how the menu breaks up the pasta by the type of sauce it's in. There's nothing worse than having to guess whether the pasta is doused in a cream sauce or simply olive oil. The pastas are broken down into tomato sauce, extra virgin olive oil & garlic, creamy tomato sauce, and cream sauce. 

The menu also boasts a long selection of pizzas! You can opt for the classic Margherita or a speciality pizza (the Elena is to die for). 

If you're coming on the weekend or for dinner, make sure to make reservations."
Grazie Ristorante	4	2019-08-05	"3.5/4

I'm a fan! I've been to the location near Vaughan Mills quite a while back. The pastas are very traditional and tasty too. If you have a big appetite you will be satisfied. Price point is a bit on the high side, but it is worth it. 

Came on a long weekend in the afternoon and was seated right away. They have the same menu for lunch as dinner (I believe). 

 They serve bread before the mains (I don't think it was baked in house but still good). It comes with balsamic vinegar and EVOO. 

The mains came out quite promptly. I ordered the spinach and ricotta agnolotti. It was quite tasty. The portion size was pretty filling. My friends were also satisfied with their dishes. 

The ambience was also nice. What would make this place even better would be freshly baked bread, fresh butter, freshly grated Parmesan (small details). 

In all, I'd return every once in a while from some good quality pasta!"
Grazie Ristorante	4	2019-08-09	"Came here for dinner. 
Ambience - one level up to casual dining.
Service - super good. The waitress had all the patience to explain and list out the options. She suggested some nice vegetarian options too
Vegetarian options - many
Order:
Ham pizza - so so 
Eggplant pizza - good
Roasted chicken - good 
Two rose sauce pasta - super good
One creamy mushroom pasta - this was not good at all. Lacked flavour.
Tiramisu - not good.
Price - not bad

So my suggestion here is the rose sauce."
Grazie Ristorante	5	2019-06-20	"I went around 12:30pm on a weekday and this place was only half filled so i didnt have to wait at all for seats! I ordered the Elena pizza and I have to say this was one of the best pizza I have ever had in Canada! The pizza was made thin crusted and it had the perfect thickness to my tasting. The toppings consisted of mozzarella, grilled chicken and spinach which you cant go wrong with. I usually don't eat crust but I had no problem finishing the crust of this pizza because it was not dry and hard at all. I shared this with one other person and we were both very full afterwards. 

Ps: Every table also came with a basket of bread along with olive oil and balsamic vinegar for us to dip in."
Grazie Ristorante	2	2019-10-24	"My review is for Uber eats delivery from Grazie.
We ordered 2 pizzas-1 classic margarita and one mushroom. Both pizzas were stone cold and were undercooked. It tasted kind of like frozen pizza you can get from a supermarket. 
There are so many great pizza places in the area and unfortunately this isn't one of them"
Grazie Ristorante	4	2019-02-05	"Great lunch spot! Amazing service with really tasty food. I am in town visiting and everyone suggested to eat here. Everything is made fresh and you can really taste it! 

I ordered the pasta with green beans, chicken, and snow peas. Everything tastes fresh and the meal had a lot of great flavors."
Grazie Ristorante	1	2020-03-05	We arrived at 9:34 pm two times and they didn't let us to be seat because kitchen is closed. Operation hours indicated til 10 pm and they blocked customer come in 30mins before that doesn't make sense.
Grazie Ristorante	5	2020-01-09	This is one of my favourite restaurants in the Yonge/Eglinton area. It was recommended to me by a coworker and I am so glad I tried it out. The first time I came here, I ended up coming back multiple times within the month. I was obsessed with the food. Specifically, ordering the tasca and the basta. Usually when I go with my boyfriend, we order one of each and share. They are so delicious but if you have to choose one only, definitely go for the tasca and you won't regret it. I've tried the pizza as well and I would definitely recommend getting pasta instead. The pizza is good but their pasta is just so much better.
Grazie Ristorante	4	2018-12-11	"I am generally not a huge fan of Italian pasta, but my partner really likes it. She recommended Grazie because she's had positive experience with it and especially at this location. 

I declined on the pasta and went with a pizza instead. I will say there were plenty of choices that kind of piqued my interests. I went with the Nduja pizza. My partner also had the same issue as I did. She had a difficult trying to pick out what exactly she wanted. In the end she picked the Tasca, a stuffed Agnolotti. It was one big Agnolotti or Agnolotto? not sure on the terminology. 

I'll speak to my pizza first. The pizza was of a nice thin crust, good cook on the dough, the toppings were good. The cheese isn't very strong, especially not against the Nduja sausage. It's spicy tanginess highlight the pizza, along with the slight oiliness it from the rendered fat of the sausage. The basil, was probably the thing that balances out the pizza. I kind of wish there was more, but the pizza still hit some powerful profiles on my palate. The thinness of the pizza and the cripsy and chewiness of the dough made easy to devour the whole things without making it seem too heavy.  

The Agnolotti was pretty good. The mix of the cheese and vegetable along with the sauce made for a creamy and smooth mouthful. It wasn't something I would normally get for myself, but I'd consider it next time. 

I don't have so much to say about this restaurant. The food was good but in my opinion, it doesn't change my mind all that much about pastas or Italian food. I have nothing against it and I don't love it, but I can always get down with a good slice of pizza, or bruschetta. Pasta doesn't always sit well with me. I occasionally get a small pasta every now and then and I think I could consider coming to Grazie eat my next pasta."
Grazie Ristorante	4	2019-07-30	"Decently priced pasta and pizzas, with a good menu variety. My favourite pasta at the restaurant so far, is the udine (a cream sauce pasta). I also really like their tiramisu. Their food is not amazing, but still pretty good, compared to a lot of Italian restaurants.
I think my only 'complaint' is that all the times I went there previously, they didn't take reservations yet, and the staff sometimes wasn't very attentive in terms of seating people when you're waiting to be seated and it's not busy. But hey, I've always been seated within half an hour, so there's that."
Grazie Ristorante	5	2019-04-30	"I just came from a terrible experience waiting to be seated at Terroni at summerhill. They refuse to give an estimate on wait time as a ""Policy"". Their atmosphere was conceted, entitled and inconsiderate. They scoffed and said that we should have gotten a reservation after making us wait 40 mins. 

Grazie totally erased the stress and enragement I had. They turned a what could possibly have been a terrible birthday for my brother into a extremely pleasant and memorable night. They were packed full but was able to accurately tell me exactly how long it would take to seat us, even though they had other reservations. You could really tell how experienced the staff was. The food was well balanced and delicious. We had the goat cheese salad, completely surprised at the flavors they created with roasted vegetable, the creaminess of the goat cheese and the texture of the philo just works. The papperdelle pasta was like the most comforting beef stew that lives up to your cravings. Their pizza dough is so good it makes you want to eat the crust first. For dessert we had the orange ricotta cheese cake. It was this light citrusy flavour that was just enough to cut through the creamy texture. 

I can't thank Grazie enough for living up to our expectation of great Italian food and hospitality."
Grazie Ristorante	5	2019-11-16	I absolutely love this place! I've been a whole 3 times. I've had the tasca twice, definitely a favourite! It's essentially a giant ravioli, filed with brie, mushrooms and spinach. Smothered in a rich rose sauce. It's huge and amazingly delicious. I went today and had the salmon pasta (forgot the name), and as usual simply amazing! The service is also outstanding. I've had Jordan twice, he's very friendly and efficient and definitely makes the experience! I don't usually leave my area for food, but Grazie is always worth the subway trip!
Grazie Ristorante	5	2019-12-04	"I've been to Grazie multiple time, and it's definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurant in the area. I always get their pizza (all the ones I tried so far have been very delicious), but my girlfriend likes to get their pasta. 

It's one of our go-to places whenever we're near the area. There are times when they get really busy (usually weekend dinner), so try to make reservations if you can. I believe they take reservations on weekends before 6pm."
Grazie Ristorante	4	2019-06-11	This is one of my fave Italian restaurants in the area. I always look forward to great Italian pasta and pizza. They also have a small selection of appetizers, and entrees. On a Sunday around noon it was quiet but the restaurant quickly got busier. We had the mussels, Varese salad, Milano pasta and the veal cutlet. Everything was so fresh and beautifully presented. Service is excellent. The only thing I would like to see here are some changes to the menu. It has remained constant over the years and true to taste but a few seasonal inspire dishes and modifications would make this place more current.
Grazie Ristorante	3	2019-03-09	"We came to Grazie for dinner on a Friday evening. It was half empty when we came in (around 4:45), but it was packed by 6pm. Honestly, I expected food to be better based on all the reviews, however it wasn't spectacular food! Service was fine (when it wasn't busy), ambience was traditional but very noisy (perhaps because restaurant is small and packed with people). 

I don't know if I'll return to try again as would like to explore other restaurants around."
Grazie Ristorante	4	2018-09-01	"Came here based on all the rave reviews and it lived up to the hype.

We started off with the muscles in white wine sauce which were really simple but tasty, and it's perfect for dipping your bread in too. For mains, I got the Giovanni pizza, and my friend got the Tasca. Of the two, I much preferred the Tasca. It's a pasta filled with mushrooms, spinach and brie & ricotta cheese.  The rosé sauce it is served with is delicious too.

Although the pizza was good - lots of flavourful toppings and really filling (I could only eat half) - I found it a little too salty and the crust was a bit too dense for my liking. Next time I visit I'd definitely get a pasta dish.

The atmosphere inside is nice - it could work for something classy but also something casual as well. There is also a bar in the middle of the restaurant so if you want to just come in and have a drink you can do that as well. The service was fast and all the staff were very polite."
Grazie Ristorante	4	2019-02-18	"We went to Grazie once more than 10 years ago. We did have a good memory from our last visit and over the years always wanted to go back. So this time that we went again our good memory got refreshed. They have a good size menu with several options for pizza and pasta. Their service is also great and the staff is very attentive and friendly. The prices are reasonable as well. I got the Nico which was pappardelle with veal and mushrooms. I really liked it. Very flavorful. 
I think Grazie is a great option if you're looking for a place for a low key date night or a small group gathering. Everyone likes Italian food and Grazie doesn't disappoint. 

Food: 4/5
Price: 4/5
Service and atmosphere: 4.5/5
Overall: 4/5"
Eataly	4	2020-04-10	I've been to the Eataly in Chicago (which is at least twice the size of the Toronto location, and sells wine as well), and was pleasantly surprised. The take-out pizza is amazing, and the La Pizza and La Pasta's offerings were also delicious. The tiramisu is always a huge hit -- at multiple social gatherings (pre-pandemic). The large tiramisu for take-out (approx $30) is probably more worth it than the small size (approx $15) as it's more than double the size of the small one, and you'll probably want to have more of it to go around!
Eataly	4	2020-03-15	"Went to Trattoria Milano within the Eataly complex for dinner. Lovely ambiance and service with great food, overall a very enjoyable experience.

Atmosphere:
Situated in the Eataly collection of shops, was reminiscent of walking through a food market. Greeted by staff in Italian and the environment was joyous and vibrant with energy.

Food:
We ordered the Sblagiato Rosa and Il Padrino for drinks and the zafferano risotto and Casoncelli alla Bergamasca (braised veal ravioli) as mains with a side of broccolini, followed by tiramisu for dessert. Drinks were refreshing with a nice twist that had an interesting back story.

Zafferano risotto was simple and included saffron and bone marrow as ingredients, although the bone marrow flavour was quite light. Texture was good and cooked al dente.

Braised veal ravioli was delicious with the right mixture of sweetness, salty, and gamy umami flavours. Bite of the shell was incredible and perfect and dish was served in an ideal portion size.

Tiramisu dessert was as expected and a terrific finish to the meal. Classic flavours and presentation was a nice touch.

Service:
Great service and drinks were well explained with a colour backstory. Attentive staff and ideal delivery and timing of dishes."
Eataly	3	2020-04-04	"Eating at Eataly is a mission and a half. 
Starting with the half mission, parking. Looking for public parking or street parking was a disaster. Found out after, I could have parked at the Manulife centre and received a 2 hour parking voucher if $50 was spent at Eataly, located upstairs, which was validated by reception, located on the main level. Yes, that's the process. Wild. 

That was the half mission - on to the full mission. In addition to navigating to find Eataly from the streets, you'll have to navigate to the Manulife Centre then up to the second floor. Here, you'll have to navigate through hoards of people, waiting in line or casually roaming around. Once you've done a full walk and decided where to eat, it's another 1-2 hour wait for a table at your desired restaurant. Tip. Do it the reverse way. Go to the restaurant and make your reservation THEN roam around. 

Finally, on to the food review. 
I chose La Piazza. Three items. 

Mozzarella ball. This was 4/5. It was soft and fresh as expected. Sprinkled with olive oil and salt. 

Mushroom pizza. 2/5. Basic pizza. I know. While consuming, I had a feeling I've had better at a mom and pop local pizza shop.

Penne. 3/5. Average. Nothing special to say. It was al dente - which was advertise. 

Verdict. Would I return? No. So much hype for no reason. Crowded beyond belief. 

However, if you made it this far, please try the cannoli - it made the trip worth it. They offered classic cow milk. They do offer the traditional sheep milk, it's definitely an acquired taste. These were 5/5.

I also forgot to mention. Eataly does offer fresh pasta and the freshest vegetables I have ever seen."
Eataly	3	2020-03-18	"This place is definitely overrated and way too crowded.

You'll have to wait over an hour to get seated at one of the restaurants and although the food is more affordable than most Italian restaurants in the city, the wait isn't worth it.

If you go, just grab a few slices of the pizza from the  counter along with a bottle of wine, grab a seat and enjoy that.

I'll only be going back to get cheeses and cold cuts from the market ad this was exceptional."
Eataly	3	2020-03-11	"Eataly is located in the Manulife building but it has its own entrance (you have to walk past the Manulife building entrance) to see the Eataly one. If you go in the Manulife entrance, it's like a wild goose chase trying to find Eataly - there's no signage or direction anywhere. 

In general, Eataly is a nice concept for all things italian. The items are a little on the pricier side and you can get most items elsewhere for cheaper. But as my friend said, it's the Eataly experience.

There are a few restaurants (reservations recommended), counter type food stations, desserts, coffee, a bar, and a grocery store with meats, cheese, olives etc. 

I also think a lot of the produce products will end up in the garbage - you can see them starting to turn bad. Not sure if there is a large enough market for those products. 

Overall, it was a nice place to visit but the experience was just okay. It can get crowded with people everywhere just browsing. The food was just okay (we ate at La Pizza and La Pasta, and had a cannoli and a tiramisu after). I feel like I've had better Italian Food elsewhere. 

Come for the hype once and then spend your $$ elsewhere."
Eataly	5	2020-03-08	"This review is for La Focaccia in Eataly. The technique they use to bake their pizza is absolutely divine. The crust is crunchy yet each bite into the pizza is so soft. 

I tried 4 different slices of pizza here and they were all equally amazing so don't even bother following my pizza order and just order what sounds good to you because I promise it'll blow you away.

The pizzas are made fresh and turnover is high (given the long line so the demand is high!). You can see the chefs making the pizza while you wait in line too! 

I'm already thinking about my next visit here and you bet I'll be ordering another slice (or 3) before I head home :)

P.S. You can ask them to reheat your pozza if you're eating it immediately"
Eataly	4	2020-02-22	"Finally made it to this place for a late lunch. Even though it was late lunch, this place is busy and bustling with people. 

Walked around 2nd floor and went to a pizza and pasta joint. Even though the place was busy, the servers moved fast to clean and set us up. 

Saw the menu and heard the special for the day. We got some fresh mozzarella, pasta dish (I didn't dare to try to butcher the name of the dish in front of the Italian server) and the pizza special (ate too fast and almost forgot to take a picture). 

Food came out quite fast, and mozzarella was fresh and light. Pasta was light, al dente and had the right flavour. Pizza was the Neapolitan style, tasty and did not feel heavy at all. 

I would rate the entire place a 3.5 stars, rounding up to a 4. It's quite good with service and food."
Eataly	3	2020-02-20	"I went on a Wednesday night around 8pm and was surprised there still many people, however, the wait for a table is not long.  Staff are all very friendly and very informative as I was asking about what wine to drink and etc.  The place is bright and clean but the only thing was I think (at least that's what I believe) there was only one washrooms to share for the entire Eataly.  
Food: the kale salad is a must!  It was so tasty!  The pasta was cooked to my liking (i asked a little cooked over al denta) and pizza was ok.  Overall I would come if there is no long wait.  And I still need to try their desserts!"
Eataly	4	2020-02-27	"Gotta come check out this place if you love all things italian! Eataly is a grand building with restaurants, grab and go foods, gelato desserts, grocery store, and marketplace with fresh cheese, meats and more.

Their FRESH PASTA are absolutely HEAVENLY! Every layer of flavours was balanced to perfection! Their high quality food tasted so fresh, and every bite was delicious. Recommend making a reservation at the restaurant prior to going in because the live wait time can go up to 1hr depending on the rush hour line ups. The best thing that I love about this place is that you can buy the exact sauce and authentic ingredients from what was served at the restaurant right in the grocery market next to the restaurant!! How cool is that! 

Don't forgot to save your stomach for a scoop of their awesome gelato! The tiramisu flavour and the pistachio flavour were so unique and definitely two of our top favourites. They also have other cool desserts worth checking out too, like cannoli, tiramisu cake, chocolate and so much more."
Eataly	1	2020-02-21	"OK
in life we are allowed to change our minds.
This place is so CONGESTED and FRUSTRATING.
You had to know it would be a success!???  Rent the whole building out!?  A claustrophobic maze getting in and out of here..  want a coffee/espresso upstairs; FORGET about it; I've been 8 times; only twice was the line under a dozen people, it's good but the line is too long.  Some of the worst cashiers at pizza line; chatting, hugging, orders wrong... I don't think I like this place anymore."
Eataly	3	2020-03-07	"A group of us went for dinner at La Piazza within Eataly. Note this restaurant's dishes are meant to be like tapas and a shared family style - about the size of appetizers. We ordered aranchini, marinated mackerel (scombro), a white (quattro formagi) and a red pizza (bufalo), spinach ricotta ravioli (quadrati), and the rainbow trout entree with fingerling potatoes. Our favorites were the quadrati (al dente with a flavorful creamy filling and lemony sauce to cut the richness), the aranchini (so creamy & cheesy!), and the rainbow trout which was cooked to perfection with a crispy skin. The scombro was very good as well. Extremely underwhelming was the pizza which we wouldn't recommend; the white cheese pizza was sparse on the cheese and very dry, and while the bufalo had more flavour due to the tomato sauce is was soggy/spongy. 

Service was excellent and attentive without being invasive - and our lovely server corrected an ordering error I made without fuss or hesitation when I accidentally ordered the wrong pizza. We were not charged for it which was really appreciated, given it was our first time there and an honest mistake. 

And the whole of Eataly is just fun to eat and shop your way through. Recommend for a great night out!"
Eataly	5	2020-02-21	"Ate at Pizza Alla Pala. Damn the pizza is soooooooo gooooood. Honestly just go for the pizza. Then grab some gelato (I didn't have time but I hear only good things). 

So glad they opened one in Toronto. Anytime I'm downtown, this may be the spot. 

Mmmmmmm mmmmmm good."
Eataly	4	2020-01-28	"Eataly is located in the Manulife Centre at the south east corner of Bay and Bloor.  

What at this point most likely takes the largest footprint of this facility, it may have been Ashley before the major renovation.  Eataly Toronto is like Eataly Flatiron approximately fifty thousand square feet.  That's quite a footprint considering this is on multiple levels in an uptown location of Bloor-Yorkville.  For Eataly though you need a large footprint to be able to house multiple food counters, restaurants, full blown grocery options, walls of products and a place for cooking classes.  

For those that don't know Eataly is basically a huge Italian superstore.  This store may not have everything you're looking for that is Italian in that they don't have Ferarri or Lamborghini for sale but they do have prosciutto from Modena and many other places for that matter.  Looking for Grana Padano or Reggio Parmigiana?  Will a wheel do?  The guy working the cheese counter said somebody came in and bought half a wheel cut lengthwise for a wedding just the other day.  

While the place doesn't have Santa Maria Novella like the NYC Flatiron store they do have on premise made beer at the birroteca on the concourse level.  Using Italian hops and other ingredients Eataly Toronto has the only on premise brewery of all the Eataly establishments so that's sort of special.

I had out of town guests and while my wife has been to Eataly Toronto already I had not been so my first visit was going to be with the out of towners.  We spent quite a bit of time at the olive oil wall as they were trying samples and deciding which to get.  My wife picked one she knew she wanted without trying any samples.  My friends tried a variety and eventually bought one and also a bottle of balsamic to go with it.  My friends ended up getting fresh ravioli nearby as well.

It was mid afternoon on a Friday and the pasta and Neapolitan pizza restaurants had some seating but we were already going to eat a few hours later at a place we made reservations for earlier in the day.  I noticed the Roman style pizza bar was quite popular and a quicker option.  I had the Roman pizza in the Eataly in Century City and I prefer it to the Neapolitan actually.  I like the crunch and the variety of slices I can get in one sitting and while Neapolitan doesn't take very long to make the Roman slices are ready.

Overall Eataly is overwhelming.  While I've been to 3 others (NYC - Flatiron, Chicago, LA - Century City) I found Toronto's to be as good as at least Flatiron but less streamlined.  Toronto's version is more like an Ikea gauntlet that makes you go through the entire store to say get to the gelato bar.  At Flatiron and Chicago the Lavazza and gelato can be accessed at the first floor level without having to go all the way in.  The Toronto setup has the café type areas in the area on the upper level facing Bloor where there's the pasta/pizza area, bar, coffee/dessert stand, Roman pizza all in a corner.

The content of Eataly Toronto is basically all there in an unfamiliar footprint albeit still somewhat organized.  I like this concept and I'll be back to try the other offerings like the pizza and pasta."
Eataly	4	2020-02-20	"This review is strictly on the takeout/ market section. Overall the place is lively, clean and nicely decorated. Service is just alright.... Weekends are generally much more busier. If you go during off hours, it's so much more relaxing to maneuver around. Prices are somewhat reasonable for the fresh items but quite pricey for the imported items, but this is expected since it's located at Yonge and Bloor. 

I love their fresh mozzarella but too bad they already increased the price since opening. :( The pizzas are also tasty and is first come first serve. You only get to choose whatever is available on display at the point of ordering. I think 1.5 slices would have properly filled me. $6-$9 per slice. The fresh pastas are alright, seems like they make it earlier in the day so it doesn't taste that fresh. Overall,  nice environment with an assortment of italian antipasto, savoury dishes, desserts and coffee!"
Eataly	5	2020-02-18	"Second visit to dine at Eataly was amazing. This time it was at ""La Piazza"". Quoted 35 minutes for the wait on a Sunday late afternoon.

Shared a soppressata and funghi pizza with a glass of Aperol Spritz. Both pizza options were delicious. Not your typical thin crust, wood oven pizza but something thicker and softer in texture to consume.

Impeccable service as always."
Eataly	2	2020-01-14	"We ate at the Le Pizza La Pasta restaurant. 

I would have given this place 4/5 if it weren't for what happened with our billing/menu.

We came in on a Tuesday night. Put our name in and had a walk around for 40-45 minutes. Overall the food was good. We ordered a pasta and a pizza along with the Burutta as an appetizer. The bread came with some really tasty olive oil. The pizza was excellent with generous toppings. I found our pasta good but not great. 

WHAT WENT WRONG: The menu had the Burutta for $8. When the receipt came - I did a quick glance and paid the bill. However the total came up higher than I thought it would be I went back to look at the receipt. The Burutta showed up as $18. I did a double take on a new menu from the front desk to make sure it said $8. My server was elsewhere by now. I went to the front to ask the hostess who at this point basically dismissed me with a chuckle that the menu was ""printed wrong"". I was in a rush so left but I would have definitely taken this up with the manager.

I really think they should have just fixed their menu (even just pencilled it in), or warned me it was a pricing error when I ordered."
Eataly	4	2020-01-11	"Yay Toronto has it's own Eataly! I remember being blown away by how novel it was the first time I visited in Las Vegas. It has been open for a bit  now so I was hoping that the hype would have died down a little bit. It's still crazy busy! It's actually a little hard to get to where you want to go because of how narrow the aisles are. If people are in browsing mode in front of you there isn't much you can do about it, especially in the main arteries. 

The marketplace style means that there are different stalls that sell different goods - an area for breads, seafood, fresh produce, etc. There are also some stalls with ready to eat food like Roman-style pizza, gelato, coffee, and desserts. Eataly also boasts three of its own restaurants. La Pizza & La Pasta seemed to be the most popular with people taking up all the spaces in the waiting area and long lines just to get a number on the reservation list. La Pescheria, which is their seafood restaurant, had open seating at lunch so if the wait is too long at the other restaurants you can always come here. 

Eataly spans a few floors and is a separate entrance from the Manulife Centre. There are escalators and one elevator that can move you between floors. There are restrooms located on the main level of the Eataly."
Eataly	5	2020-02-22	"I love Eataly... does this make me sound rich lmao. I just love a good food paradise. From food markets to brewery, from restaurants to bars, theres almost everything you need here food wise? It also looks pretty vegan friendly because I saw a variety of oat, soy, cashew milk. As my friend and I were browsing, I saw this couple sitting and eating this flatbread looking thing with prosciutto and stracchiatella... didn't want to be creepy and interrupt them, so my friend and I were on the hunt for this cheese. Turns out it was the tricolore pizza at the pizza place closest to the bar. The pizza was SO GOOD. Had a couple of drinks at the bar so i was a little  nonetheless, people kept coming up to us and asking where we got the pizza. We should be sponsored for putting in such a good word. I wanted to buy the stracchiatella on it's own but it appears to be out of stock. 

Oh yeah, most things here were pricey - including the veggies in the corner. I guess that's what happens when things are a little more fancy?"
Eataly	4	2020-01-05	"This is such a cool place to visit - whether you're here as a tourist, for groceries, or to grab a bite - Eataly is a vibrant spot for high quality Italian goods. 

I came here just to check out what they had to offer and ordered some small treats and a few bottles of milk to go. 

This place is very packed on weekends, so plan accordingly. They have everything from fresh pastas, to different varieties of cheese, pizza, and desserts. I bought a bottle of whole milk and egg nog (about $5 each for 1L). 

I ordered a cannoli that was freshly made and was quite satisfied!"
Eataly	3	2020-01-08	"Overall a cool place to visit. I had no idea what this place was, until I heard all they hype about it. When I received a gift card for it, I finally decided to check it out. We went on a Sunday afternoon and as expected it was busy. Assuming that there was line ups for the first week it was opened, it wasn't too bad. 

To start off, space itself was modern and vibrant. It was nicely decorated and had a little of everything. There was a supermarket, which kind of wrapped around the whole 2nd floor. From hand made pastas, sauce, cheese and etcs., they had it all. Surrounding the market was a few take out and, dine in restaurants as well, as cafe's and dessert. They also seemed to have classes too! 

The dine in restaurants were of course busy and, there was a wait so we opt'ed out for the take out joints. For the pizza, there was a variety of them but sold out quick (but also seemed like they were made quickly). There was also a take out joint, right when you go up the escalators which, seemed to have a variety of dishes. The gelato was one of my favorite things there and, maybe the best in the city so that's worth giving it a try. The desserts and chocolate, also looked amazing!

Overall, it was a cool experience and, would visit again to try the restaurants and dessert out!"
Nodo Restaurant	5	2020-05-05	Hands down one of the best Italian restaurants in the city. Wonderful service upon pick up and just outstanding food. The new school gnocchi and the duck cavatelli are just beyond. Etna calzone was pure heaven. Flourless chocolate cake was flawless. Thank you, Nodo. I will come back again and again.
Nodo Restaurant	5	2020-03-02	"WOW! Amazing food !
Thanks Charlie and Frankie T for a great lunch! Wasn't one dish of the 4-5 I tried that I wasn't completely amazed by."
Nodo Restaurant	5	2020-01-24	"My friends and I made a reservation here at 5:30pm as I heard that this place gets busy fairly quickly and we were seated immediately and as we left, there was a short line forming. Service here was amazing!!! The servers were very pleasant and were very informed with the menu and answered all the questions we had about it. I ordered the margarita pizza, named as ""Regina pizza"" on the menu. It was very good and I enjoyed my time here as it was a very splendid experience and I am glad I came here since I do not eat Italian food that often."
Nodo Restaurant	4	2019-10-02	"Had a great lunch with my mother in the Junction last weekend at Nodo!  Most of the restaurant looked a little dark, but we sat by the window, which was lovely and bright.  

The arancini was easily my favourite.  Super crispy on the outside, hot and flavourful on the inside.

The tagliatelle with duck ragu was fine.  I didn't find that the pasta was al dente, but it also wasn't soggy... but I don't know exactly how to describe the texture, but it was pretty springy.  The flavour was good.

The pizza was good too.  Pretty good crust and sauce.

Another favourite was the bread pudding with housemade banana gelato!  The gelato was super flavourful, so for anyone who likes bananas, I would recommend this.  The bread pudding was moist and delicious!  This dessert was definitely on the sweet side."
Nodo Restaurant	3	2019-05-01	"My friend recently moved to the Junction area and we decided to try this place out. Unfortunately, we didn't have a great experience. I was the first to arrive and there were quite a few empty tables on a Friday evening. The hostess said that she'd seat me when the rest of my party arrived (understandable). 5 minutes later, another customer came in (she was an older woman) and said she was waiting on 2 other people. The hostess sat her down immediately, which was a little weird to me but I didn't want to cause a scene and didn't ask about it. When the rest of my party arrived, it took them forever to seat us as it was getting busier and they were slightly understaffed. 

The food itself was good but the portions were small for the appetizers. We ordered the burrata and octopus to share. The burrata salad tasted fresh but for $20 it wasn't worth it in my opinion. Likewise, the octopus was chopped up into tiny pieces and served with potatoes. We each had about 2 tiny bites of octopus. However, the most disappointing part of the meal was the main. All four of us got the duck ragu pappardelle and I was surprised that it came with tomato sauce. The pappardelle itself tasted fresh and they were generous with the duck but too bad they were drenched in tomato sauce. I've had amazing ragu sauce at other places before and this was overwhelmingly disappointing despite it being one of their best seller. I don't think I'll be coming back here anytime soon."
Nodo Restaurant	5	2019-11-04	"Wonderful restaurant located in the Junction.  Great atmosphere and good service. Best gnocchi in the city.  The riceballs are also a must try. & make sure to save room for dessert-they have a great array of scrumptious desserts. 
Highly recommend."
Nodo Restaurant	4	2018-11-06	"I was in the 'hood and stopped by for a nice lunch.

Service is casual, not overly attentive...which is fine.  Some lupini beans / fresh bread with EVOO arrived before our food.  Both were nice!

Prices were in around $20 for pizza/pastas.  The pizza was polished off, but I ate about half the pasta.  It's a healthy portion!  Between the 2 dishes, the Rigatoni with Veal Bolognese sauce was the clear winner.  Pizza was good too, thin, chewy with a slight crunch!

I'd definitely go back, but may try the St. Clair location first to compare notes.  

Don't forget the wine!  Most of it dry, but the organic one that I had was delish...especially with the red sauce!  Yum, yum."
Nodo Restaurant	5	2018-09-20	"We came here for a private baptism lunch and OMG the food was AMAZING! I ate things that I typically don't and I loved it.  

For starters, we were served this really refreshing salad with pickles veggies and a light vinaigrette dressing. We then moved on to lamb skewers and pizza with prosciutto and cantaloupe.  For our pasta dish, it was this really creamy cauliflower pasta with cheese. I typically don't do creamy pastas because I'm more of a marinara girl but this dish was da bomb, second servings please!  For our main, it was chicken with rapini and roasted veggies.  The chicken was super tender and juicy, and paired with my favourite veggies.  

I checked their menu and all of the above items are on their regular menu, I can't wait to go back! It's that good."
Nodo Restaurant	3	2018-07-04	"The food over at the St. Clair location is way better as well as the service. You can check out my review there. 

Keep Eating, 
Angela"
Nodo Restaurant	5	2020-02-15	We came in on a crowded Saturday night and were promptly seated at the last remaining table. Friendly,  quick service. Food was delivered incredibly fast and tasted great. Atmosphere was fun and lively. We stumbled onto this place by accident and it was great. Truly a local restaurant that is a diamond in the rough.
Nodo Restaurant	4	2018-04-26	"Heard this joke while I was at Nodo - Why are a lot of Italian men named Tony? Because when they migrated over to the states, they wore name tags To NY.

This is a cute cozy restaurant with great food and service.  I came for dinner with a group of 6 and had a great time.  There are many great options on the menu including soup, pizza, calzone, mussels, octopus, rigatoni, and gnocchi.  Complimentary bread was brought out with olive oil after we ordered.  The food took a while to come out, but it was delicious.  

Arancini $9 - These were more like rice cones, crunchy on the outside and cheesy on the inside.
Pappardelle $19 - This duck ragu ribbon pasta dish was excellent.  The meat was like pulled duck, flavorful and tender.  The sauce went really well without everything.

Street parking on Dundas is free on weekdays after 6p.  I was able to find a spot across the street when I am for dinner on a Wednesday night.  There are also paid parking lots nearby.

Nodo Restaurant	5	2019-06-26	"This place is fantastic......Terroni's please take notes.

Amazing pizza, thin crust, firm and full of flavour. 
Actually anything I try here is done well.....
Great food and awesome service without the pretentious attitude of other restaurants with similar food."
Nodo Restaurant	5	2019-01-22	"So much to love about dear Nodo.  The pastas are beautifully simple.  The pizza divine. The service is enthusiastic.  I'm confused by the amuse bouche of the olive oil drenched lupini beans, but no matter.  Here's a little yarn as to why they deserve 5 stars and your business: 

After a number of positive experiences, I dropped by to order a couple of pastas to go.  The bartender, who was not busy, was rude and abrasive.  He punched  in my order like a cashier at 7-11 and split.  As he left, I said ""I'd love a glass of wine while I'm waiting."" Which he basically ignored.

The pasta arrived in a bag by a smiling kitchen runner and I got up to leave.  As I left, the manager asked ""how was everything tonight?"" I told him his bartender was an a-hole and was gobsmacked by how terribly he treated me.  His face fell. What happened next was amazing.  The manager couldn't react fast enough, saying it was entirely his fault as he hires the staff that that kind of poor behavior is unacceptable.  He produced a $50 gift card and asked to have another chance to continue to earn my business.  

My wife and I came 2 nights later and were enchanted once again.  We're loyal customers for life.  

The point I'm trying to make is restaurants have off nights.  The management can screw up.  The chef can drop the ball.  We're all human.  What counts is how management reacts to you IN PERSON gripe.  He was a gentleman and handled us with care.  

Going home and giving a restaurant one star because they forgot your dessert is ridiculous.  Saying it's expensive is ridiculous.  The menu is on the door.  

Yelp can be somewhat uneven and unfair in this regard which is why we returned and gave them another chance and it was well worth it.  

Before you ding a restaurant's Yelp score, talk to the management in person.  If they blow you off, leave them one star.  But in this case of perfectly executed damage control, Nodo gets 5."
Nodo Restaurant	4	2017-07-16	"Came on a weekday evening with 2 of my friends. The restaurant seems small and the sound level is more on the loud side. 

The goods:
- Trinacria rigatoni - well balance of flavour. Ingredients were really fresh and pasta was cooked to al dente. 
- New school gnocchi - fried gnocchi which was crispy and did not get soggy in the sauce. Nutty, creamy and overall flavourful
- Tiramisu - soft and light! It was a large slice that could be shared amongst 2 people

The OK:
- pizza - I forgot which one we had but I did not enjoy it

We also ordered the calamari and arachini which were good but not mind blowing-must order every time I come here good. 

Decent service. Food is more on the pricey side but I feel the goods is worth it. I would come back for the pastas which I believe is a 5/5 in my book and my overall experience is 4/5"
Nodo Restaurant	4	2018-06-08	"Great ambiance ! 
Good staff here. 
Appetizers are a bit small. 
Menu selection was short. 
Wine selection is alright!"
Nodo Restaurant	3	2018-06-24	For such a charming looking restaurant with high ratings, I had big hopes for Nodo. I loved the decor and set up, which I describe as a rustic boho chic. However, the food fell short of expectations and did not taste very authentic at all. I ordered the tradition gnocchi recommend by our server, it was so so. My friend had better luck with the fish. We shared the tiramisu for dessert, but that was also underwhelming and we only ate a quarter of it. The portions are fairly large if that helps.
Nodo Restaurant	5	2018-04-17	"We ordered the roasted rainbow beets with heirloom carrots and pistachio to start (it's a side, but we wanted it instead of salad or appetizers). The texture of the beets and carrots was great and the pistachio gave it a lovely flavour and crunch.

We were craving pizza and ordered the Marea and the daily special (burrata with tomatoes and arugula). The crust was ultra thin - which we loved - and the toppings were fresh. Our wait was much longer than expected because several pizza takeout orders were ahead of us in the queue. However, our waitress checked on us often and explained the delay; we enjoyed conversation and seeing the pasta dishes that were served to neighbouring tables as we waited. 

We shared the cannoli; the ricotta filling was the creamiest I've eaten! 

Several other items on the menu caught my attention. I'll definitely be back!"
Nodo Restaurant	5	2019-02-14	"I've ate here so much. Uber eats. Take out. Dinning inn. No matter what way the food enters my tummy it's always bang on. My fav place on st. Clair!! Hands down amazing!  
I may be the only person in the world who doesn't like pizza. But after eating a pizza made like that I'm a pizza lover now"
Nodo Restaurant	5	2018-10-26	"We came out for dinner and decided Nodo was the best option tonight.  We were not disappointed. 

The food was delicious. 

We decided on the calamari, pizza and pasta special. Wow!  The flavours were spectacular, the service was attentive.  

We had a minor issue with our meal, and the manager was amazing, dealt with our issues right away. 

We will definitely be back."
Nodo Restaurant	4	2019-05-01	Wanted some food in the junction. Had the red pappardelle and one of the pizzas. Quality food, fair prices!
Levetto	5	2020-01-27	Wow! Amazing food! Great big, filling portions, made fresh, and piping hot. Definitely check this place out. The reviews don't lie or exaggerate! Will certainly be back! That's a pic of the beef ragu with perfectly cooked and freshly made rigatoni.
Levetto	3	2020-05-20	Freshly made, high quality ingredients. However for me, it was made with too much pepper and it was lacking flavour and creaminess. If an egg yolk was used, I could not taste it. I usually love carbonara, but I would not order this again.
Levetto	5	2019-11-09	Levetto is a place that i go to for quick pasta. The portion sizes are fairly large. One of the pastas we got was under cooked and when we let the server know, she took it and re-made us another one. So i would say they have great service at this location. The pasta noodle here are al dente so if you like more cooked and softer pasta, this place might mot be for you. Also, due to the undercooked vodka sauce pasta, they graciously gifted us a chocolate mousse tart. I thought it was very kind of them and i enjoyed the creamy texture as well as the crunchiness at every bite.
Levetto	2	2019-12-02	"Went for dinner with five friends to celebrate my birthday. The food was excellent until the waiter offer me complimentary dessert. After ""happy birthday"", I dug in to the mini cake. That's when my friend noticed the mould. One of my friends discretely sent the dessert back to the kitchen. The waiter did not offer us a word of apology or a discount. I found that quite surprising and unprofessional. The whole situation left a bad taste in my mouth - not sure I would return."
Levetto	5	2019-07-02	"Went here for the first time on the weekend. We got there around 8 o'clock and the restaurant was pretty empty. SUCH GOOD PASTA. I got the carbonara and bf got the beef ragu, both very very tasty. Definitely one of the best pasta dishes I've had! My carbonara had the perfect al dente pasta and the sauce was creamy but still light so you don't get sick eating too much of it. I couldn't finish my pasta so I took some home and it still taste good the next day. The server was attentive and nice as well! All in all a very pleasant experience.
Check in for the free dessert!"
Levetto	5	2019-12-02	"We love Toronto and try to visit as often as we could (unlike Chicago, expensive food with too many chains), always visiting different places. This was our first time at Levetto's, we had the affumicato pizza and arugula goat-cheese salad.
It is one of the best pizzas we've had; fresh, flavourful and not over the top. The service is also friendly; a great place to have a good memorable meal without a lot of fuss."
Levetto	5	2019-09-14	Great little spot tucked away in Liberty village. The pizza was really good for a thicker crust pizza. Although it was thick, the dough was very fluffy and light, but crispy on the outside. Their Funghi pizza was a very solid mushroom pizza,and their pasta seems to be freshly made in house. Their staff were really friendly, and good folks. We witnessed the staff celebrating a fellow coworker's birthday with a candle in pizza.. What hard working staff, working hard on a Saturday night late shift. I highly recommend this place if you're in the area and craving some good well priced Italian food.
Levetto	4	2018-09-08	"I'm a fan of all Levetto locations. 

Pizza is my signature comfort food, but lately I've been really digging their pastas. This Levetto location delivers to my house (tip of the tiny hat to Uber Eats). Their carbonara is rich, salty and everything you need to give your stomach a warm hug."
Levetto	3	2017-11-06	"First experience: Didn't receive 'regular service' (basic) when dining in, we weren't checked on and had to get up to order another drink and ask for takeaway containers. Tried pizza & rigatoni dish.
Second experience: the following week we ordered the Rigatoni dish (with braised beef) again but for take away there was only  1/4 of the amount of meat so we felt like we paid $15 for noodles and red sauce."
Levetto	5	2018-07-24	"Visiting Toronto From Carmel, IN! Yelped this restaurant and chose it based on the great reviews. We ordered the beef ragu, bread sticks and pomodoro for the 2 vegetarians. Portions are very generous and the hand made pasta was delicious!!  We would come back again - staff was great, parking easy and plentiful, atmosphere comfortable and cute!!

We used the coupon for free dessert and it was yummy: one coconut syrup cake and a blackberry panacotta. 

Update: leaving Toronto and wanted to note this was my favorite restaurant"
Levetto	2	2018-11-22	"Overrated non-authentic Italian food. Their location gives them business. 

Menu is interesting but not up to standard. Ambience is okay."
Levetto	4	2017-04-20	"Tip: check into the restaurant on Yelp for a free dessert! 

I ordered the pomodoro pasta which was a simple tomato sauce pasta cooked with olive oil and garlic. Flavour wise I thought it wasn't boring, which sometimes happens with simple tomato pastas, and quite tasty. The pasta was cooked al dente and the sauce coated the soaghetti noodles nicely. I think it's definitely worth trying for it's simple but rich flavour. Given the price you are paying for (~$9 for the dish) you're receiving a pretty big portion.

I also used the Yelp check in function and got free dessert! Friends and I ordered most of the offered desserts and I tried the white chocolate tiramisu and coconut cake. The tiramisu was very underwhelming, presentation and taste wise. Maybe because I was expecting a traditional tiramisu layered dessert but this was just lady fingers stacked onto each other with some cream. I'm not complaining as it was free dessert, but if you were to pay for it I don't think it'd be worth it. The coconut cake on the other hand was delicious! It is a very dense, moist, and strong coconut flavoured cake. A bit heavy, but good to share with others. I'd recommend this!"
Levetto	3	2018-04-15	This Levetto location is located at Dovercourt and Sudbury, a few minutes away from the busy street of Queen West. I've tried the other Levetto locations before and decided to come back to this particular location as I was in the mood for pasta. I dropped by for lunch on a Thursday; the eatery was quite empty. The pasta I ordered was filing and service was friendly but the food was just forgettable this particular time. I found the pasta to be underwhelming, under seasoned, and overcooked. Unfortunately did not have a good experience here and will not be returning.
Levetto	4	2018-03-16	I have always loved Levetto so my visit to this location did not disappoint. We ordered the carbonara and the lamb ragu pasta. Both were amazing. The portions here are always good and pasta is cooked perfectly al dente which I appreciate. My only complaint was that our order was taken wrong at first and that the waitress didn't come fill up our water until we had to ask. They also offered a free dessert if you check in on Yelp so be sure to do so. We had the panna cotta to share and it was also very good.
Levetto	5	2019-05-22	"Levetto! 
Where to begin! 
The food here is amazing. All the pastas and pizzas are made fresh and so full of flavor. The salads are so tasty and filled with all fresh ingredients. The staff are super friendly and the owner is absolutely fantastic!!! 
I would highly recommended you to eat here anytime!!! It's perfect :)"
Levetto	3	2018-11-17	"Came on a Saturday evening at 5:30 and it was empty. I had this place on my list of food to try and was looking forward to checking in and getting a free dessert. 

I was sad when they told me there wasn't any more panna cotta left which is what they would normally give as the free dessert. 

I ordered the Smoked Prosciutto pizza which wasn't bad, I enjoyed the dough as it was crispy but still fluffy inside. Looks like they make everything fresh by hand which is nice. I will try have to try the pasta next time."
Levetto	5	2018-08-24	"i love pizza!! when i say ""love"", its an understatement!! if i had to choose between a drowning person and pizza, the choice is obvious, pizza!! levettos has some really good freshly made pastas and pizzas! i love the assorted mushroom pizza!! mmm portobello, cremini and whatever other mixed fungi party they got goin on there, its perfect!! a white cream sauce (w.roasted garlic i belive) on a nice chewy but crispy focaccia style dough. i always ask for some fresh basil to top it off. mmm!! i also tried their beef rigatoni pasta! made fresh to order just the way you like it! sauce was nicely seasoned and the pasta was cooked well too! i loved their pizza so much i once booked my birthday here a few years ago...20-25 people! seating was cafeteria style and i hopped from table to table to chat w.everyone. my friends all loved it too! levettos, keep it up and open more locations!"
Levetto	2	2017-11-28	"I really wanted to like this place. I've had it bookmarked for ages as I love Italian food but I don't go downtown often so I saved it for a day when I was in the area. 
Anyways that day finally came and I went for my favourite Margarita pizza. But the excitement fizzled as soon as I saw my food. It looked sad. The crust looked crispy but when I bite into it, it was doughy and almost underdone. There was very little ingredients on the pizza and dough to ingredient ration was seriously off. I'm thinking I probably just went at the wrong time on the wrong day but still.... I've literally been waiting over a year to try this place with rad reviews. Honestly disappointed. I didn't even finish it."
Levetto	5	2017-02-03	"We went on a Friday evening at about 8 pm. The staff was really friendly and we just ordered a Margarita pizza (small to share). It was only $7 and was more than enough for the 2 of us. Really soft dough and crispy base - just the way I like it. The real icing on the cake was when we got a free dessert after we checked in on yelp!! Hello panacotta! Sooooo delicious. 
Anyway, we're coming back to try the pasta - that screen playing delicious videos was really tempting. Giving this place a 5/5 for being 5/5. Total bill was only 7.95 or something. Cheapest meal for 2 - score!"
Levetto	5	2019-02-14	Amazing! Love the location and great Food + Service! I had the Beef Ragu and it was really good! Totally recommend it!
La Vecchia Ristorante	5	2019-12-07	We had a group dinner in their private grotto.  The dinner and service was excellent.  Great cocktails.  The grotto was beautiful.  Would highly recommend for dinner or private event.
La Vecchia Ristorante	3	2019-08-15	"La Vecchia is a cute restaurant with great ambiance near Yonge & Eglinton. It is filled with wooden tables and twinkle lights. 

The service is great. We didn't make a reservation for dinner but snagged a spot at the bar. Both the bartender and our server checked in with us frequently. Our water was constantly filled up and we were asked if we desired further drinks throughout the experience. 

While the food was good, it was simply average. We had the penne alla vodka (gluten free) and the capricciosa pizza. Unfortunately, only a handful of the pasta options could be made gluten free, and none of the pizza could be made gluten free. This was fairly limiting. 

There are various delicious Italian restaurants in the area and unfortunately this one simply didn't stack up (both in taste and gluten free options). I would certainly come back for drinks (I had a delicious Aperol spritz) but would likely not come back for the food."
La Vecchia Ristorante	4	2019-04-04	"Recently came here with my friends on a saturday night. There's parking along the street and we were lucky to snag a spot close to the restaurant. The restaurant is bigger than it looks on storefront - there's actually two floors! When we first walked in it was kind of awkards becuase i had to check in with the hostess but there's only standing room behind the door and we felt kind of awkward standing there while they figure out which table we were in. They were very accomodating tho - we ran late for about 15 mins past reservation and they saved the table for us.

Our table was actually down the stairs - there was a function that night so it was a bit loud on the main floor, but downstairs it's actually much nicer and quiet. Spacing is a bit tight, but we manage to fit in a baby okay! But i would not recommend bringing in a stroller coz there's no room for that. 

Servers and staff were all very nice and friendly. lots of options to choose from - i ordered the special that night which was braised wild boar with polenta and veg. I dont' like polenta, so i asked server if i could substitute with pasta and they were able to do that with no extra charge - i asked for the fresh tegliatelle with tomato sauce. My hubby had their bufala pizza, and my other friends ordered the tegliatelle with funghi, tegliatelle with ragu and another order of the wild boar. 

Food was great! we ordered an app to share but in hindsight was not the best choice - ordered the speck and bufala and the portion was kind of small that it was a bit tough to share amongst 5 ppl. but it was very tasty.

Then the mains - they were great on the whole! the pizza was nice and crispy, lots of toppings - the middle was a bit dense tho so the pizza couldn't hold up as well as i would have liked. The wild boar was very delicious and tasty, but i felt the meat was a bit dry, almost tough in certain chunks. They gave me the polenta anyway for presentation purposes (which i gladly took pics of lol) and they served the pasta on the side instead. In general, portions were good. I felt the special the portion was a bit small for it's price point - I woud've been more full with their pasta/pizza options. HOwever, since i did have pasta on the side, I really really liked it. There is a difference in the fresh pasta compared to the dry and my friends really liked the funghi (very tasty mushrooms) and the ragu the meat was soft and moist. 

For dessert we ordered the dessert platter for four - which included the panna cotta, tiramisu, chocolate fondant cake and cheesecake. 

All four were great - loved sharing it and getting a bit of each. my handsdown favourite was panna cotta. I normally don't like panna cotta, but theirs is so creamy and rich, not too jelly like and the texture and taste BLEW my mind! Tiramisu was good too but wasn't able to outshine the panna cotta. The chocolate cake was delicious and rich. Cheesecake was average (taste just like typical cheesecake so nothing particularly special). 

All in all it was a great meal - we stayed for almost 3 hours and they didn't rush us! we were really thankful for that esp since it is a busy night for them. I will definitely be back again soon!"
La Vecchia Ristorante	4	2019-10-05	Amazing gem in the yonge and eglinton neighborhood serving out the best al dente pasta. I ordered their beef brisket ravioli pasta and it was out of this world! It was hitting all 3 S's : SOFT, SAVOURY, and Succulent...the waiters here are HOTTTT as Hell especially the one who complimented me on my Nose Ring..YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE!..indeed a great spot for some fine fine Italian Meat, Sauce, and Wine :-P. No Pun Intended!!
La Vecchia Ristorante	3	2019-07-18	"Going to start off this review by saying the food was great. Our table ordered the Caesar salad, gnocchi ragu, lobster pasta, and tagliolini con funghi. Wonderful food. 

Why the 3 stars? Boy, did we have the most annoyingly cocky/rude/ignorant waiter?! This customer service experience was so frustrating that it warranted a Yelp review. 
Upon entering the restaurant, everyone from the host to the bartenders had been amazing. We came on a busy night and we had no reservations, and the host had us seated at the bar while he scrambled to get us a table for 6. The bartender was great company, and we enjoyed our cocktails while waiting for a table. 
Of course once we were seated, we got stuck with this sarcastic douche bag of an employee... suddenly regretted choosing this restaurant just because of this dude. He made a lot of rude comments, maybe he thought he was funny? Somehow the conversation with him had eventually evolved into him reminiscing about getting 'so f**ked up one time' while our family was trying to enjoy our dinner. That was just the icing on the cake. 

The food did actually take a bit long to come out. We had waited a good half hour after ordering. 

If you can tolerate the company of some really rude and (not funny) sarcastic waiters, then I do recommend trying the food here. Otherwise, there are better places to spend $30-50 per person on dinner that will guarantee better service. Hopefully if you do go, you get a better server."
La Vecchia Ristorante	5	2019-07-25	"Great ambiance, great service, tasty food! I will definitely go back again! We went there Wed night for dinner , it is a classy restaurant but the prices are so reasonable. You need a reservation in order to guarantee your spot .
The hosts are so friendly and professional. Overall it was a great experience!"
La Vecchia Ristorante	4	2019-05-20	"La Vecchia has some of the best Italian food I've had in a long time. The seafood pasta is absolutely delicious, the bread they bring to the table is to die for, and the servers are friendly and very experienced. Especially when it comes to recommending what wine goes with what food. I'm not typically a fan of red wine, I normally prefer white wine, but when you have a glass of red wine with seafood, it just adds so much flavor to your food. I give this place 4 stars. I would've given it 5, but the restaurant is very small. Imagine having a cow in your living room surrounded with packed together families taking their teenage or twenty something kids out to dinner. That's how small the restaurant is.

Cheerio fellow foodies, 

Seth A the I$eman"
La Vecchia Ristorante	4	2017-12-02	"Oooh la la!! .... wait, that's French.  I meant... mama mia!  Lol.  Whatever the phrase, this joint is a must try Italian place.  The environment is pleasant to the eye with a fusion of modernity meets old world charm.  
The service is wonderful.  It's on the formal side, but to me, as long as they are good at what they do, i am satisfied.
Onto the food.  For appetizer i opted for Calamari Alla Griglia which is grilled calamari after fiding out that the Cozze Marinara mussels were not available.  The calamari was a good substitute though as the meat was super tender with just enough touch of flavor.  Then i moved onto Branzino, a pan seared fillet of Mediterranean Sea Bass with greens.  The taste of lemon garlic and white wine sauce was bold and unapologetic,  and so it should be.  To end the meal,  of course i had to go with tiramisu.  Heavenly."
La Vecchia Ristorante	5	2018-11-10	Best pasta and panna cotta I've ever had. My coworker said it tastes just like food in Italy
La Vecchia Ristorante	5	2018-01-22	"Finally made it over here, and I'm glad I did. Met with a friend, and made reservations for a weekday, as they still are rather busy. 

For drinks, I had the Sofia Loren I believe, and it was a nice drink to start, but just a little too sweet for my palette. We ordered a bottle of their pinot Nero, which I had never heard of before. It was so delicious! Not overly sweet or dry, and chilled to perfection. I find red wine can make me feel very sleepy if I'm having it with a larger meal. 

We ordered the antipasto to start. I did enjoy what I had, but maybe would have preferred more cheese and meat than vegetables. 

For my main, I had the ravioli which was fantastic! It wasn't like 4 tiny pieces that you get at other places. This was a very filling dish that wasn't heavy, and full of flavour. I also am a sucker for truffles. My friend got the veal special and loved it. 

Now I would have given this place a 4, but the service was amazing! Raf was our waitress and was cracking jokes with us all night. She came with me downstairs to the bathroom as I am on crutches and offered to help me inside. She honestly made the experience memorable, and I hope the restaurant does read this, as she deserves a lot of credit."
La Vecchia Ristorante	5	2019-07-08	"This is one of our favorite restaurants in the Yonge Eglinton area. The food is great. Try to get Kevin as your waiter. He makes a 10 out of your entire dining experience. He is one of those rare waiters you are lucky enough to meet that turns a nice dinner into a fabulous dining experience.
The linguine vongole was delicious. The risotto porcini was spectacular."
La Vecchia Ristorante	5	2018-09-10	"Loved the service and the food 
Great place , the ambiance is delightful 
Order this fish dish , absolutely yummy"
La Vecchia Ristorante	5	2017-12-10	"I have been to La Vecchia twice so far, and every time the food has been amazing. The service is also very great. It is a nice restaurant with a romantic vibe, perfect for a date or just to go with your friends. 
The second time I was there I got the vegetarian pizza (which was really good) and the first time I got a dish with veal and mushrooms. I remember we also got a replica of that dish with lemon instead of mushroom which turned out to be way better. Still the quality of food and service you get here is really good regardless of what you order.
I will definitely go again when I am in the area."
La Vecchia Ristorante	4	2017-12-02	"Wonderful bday lunch with mom at La Vecchia.  Service is great.  

Food is good.  Pizza is hot and love how lunch pizza come with salad.  Pasta is great with shrimp, mussel, and squid.  We got the dinner portion pasta to share.  We also got the chocolate sauced strawberries crepe.  It was loaded with berries.  We've asked for the extra cream, and the server ask if we would like table or whip cream (and I said chantilly cream lol, as my vocabulary is limited when it comes to cream).

The decor and ambience is nice.

We will return soon."
La Vecchia Ristorante	2	2019-07-08	It was under cooked noodle and no savory at all in my pasta. Overpriced and it's not worth to paying for it.
La Vecchia Ristorante	4	2018-07-24	"It looks like reservations are recommended, because my friend was running late, and when I got here alone on a Thursday evening, I was told to wait at the bar until she arrived even though there were many tables. 

Everything was good after we got seated though. I ordered the Tortellone Ricotta and a Pomelo, my friend ordered the Ravioli de Niro. The bread we received was nothing to look at or taste and seemed stale. However, our orders arrived in 5 minutes which we appreciated very much. I really enjoyed our dishes and they were filling. My Pomelo tasted good after I added the lime. 

For dessert, we had the blueberry cheesecake, garnished with a gooseberry and a dried slice of orange. It was the best texture for a cheesecake and tasted exactly how I wanted it to taste. 

Overall, good place to go with other people."
La Vecchia Ristorante	5	2018-11-18	I went here years ago for winterlicious because of the great reviews. I was so unimpressed and felt like it was like any other restaurant that I vowed never to come back. Fast forward to recently, my friends wanted to catch dinner before a movie and decided on this place. I was hesitant but went anyways and absolutely loved it! We ordered the pizza, a couple of the salads and some cocktails. LOVED all the cocktails....they were strong and didn't taste it, just the way I like it! The pizza was huge, filling and made very well. Chewy and not overwhelming in flavour. The salads were all fantastic! The Parmesan cheese is to die for. Our waiter was also so charming and funny. He really made our night....p.s. dim lit atmosphere with a picture of the godfather. Loved it!
La Vecchia Ristorante	1	2018-08-23	This place has been on my list of must-try restaurants in the Yonge-Eg area for quite some time (mostly because of all the high Yelp reviews). However, I was pretty disappointed with my experience. Cleanliness is a really big deal to me, and the restaurant did not feel very clean. There were a LOT of flies buzzing around my table, to the point that I had to swat my hand in between every single bite and was afraid one would fly into my mouth (ew!). The bread was cold, and the pasta was mediocre and at a higher price point. The waiter could see me constantly waving my hand to get the flies out of my face and made no comment. I was not impressed.
La Vecchia Ristorante	3	2018-08-29	"My family and I decided to choose La Vecchia for my mini wedding dinner, as my cousin had recommended it to us so we decided to have a go and try it out. 

The place had a very nice atmosphere, very nice with cute decors. The food was pretty good, it was flavourful with a good portion size and at a reasonable price. 

Our server just seemed like he didn't want to be there. Maybe he was too busy? Or had a rough day? So I kept it positive, didn't mention anything until my other family members almost everyone noticed as well. It was my dinner night where as I was busy talking to my family members so I've missed when he was offering cheese to the pastas. I apologized and asked if he was able to bring the cheese back again, never came back with the cheese. Overall just got a very bad vibe. We had another younger server come by to collect our plates and he had a much better attitude and was certainly polite. 

I've also told the server if we could do the bill 4 ways, it was my fault I meant everyone to themselves and asked politely if he was able to change it. The response I got was ""no it has already been done and can't change it."" Left me with such a terrible feeling to my gut that now everyone overpaid for what they haven't ordered. It was my fault I'll take it but correct me if I'm wrong? The bill can't be redone? Anyways to the end of our dinner, the server all of a sudden became friendly as the bills were being handed out. 

It was certainly a day to remember, but to keep it positive I just let it go and remembered the good food and great conversations with my family members."
La Vecchia Ristorante	1	2017-02-04	"I live in the Yonge/ Egg area and always heard this was supposed to be the best place on Yonge for food as the neighbourhood is quite lacking in the food area to begin with. 

I had high hopes for this restaurant but was gravely disappointed with the service and the food. The flavours they have are all wrong. Most of the food was very pungent and did not have a smooth flow of flavours. It was rather sour the risotto we ordered. We also ordered prawns and the sauces they chose were sour and pungent with too much salt. ( it's all in the sauce for Italian dishes). 

The Gnocchi was okay, it tasted like the Costco brand in a cream sauce ( who could mess up a cream sauce tbh) anyhow I am very disappointed. I did not find the food appetizing at all. The flavours were all mixed up and not great on the palette. 

My waiter unfortunately was very short tempered and seemed agitated the whole time whilst serving my family and I. Whenever we did need something he was never available and would rush off before we finished speaking with him. 

Anyway sad to have to review it like this but that is truly my opinion. 

No match to Campagnolo on Dundas or Buca"
Taverna Mercatto	4	2020-01-29	"Omg - orecchiette was so amazing. Freshly made
Little ears pasta with fabulous  sausage and the right amount of spice and pesto - yum! Beet and ricotta salad was pretty good too - bUt I'm not a fan of a big blob of ricotta on things. Just add to selective bites and  leave the rest.
Got the cannolo for dessert too and it was amazing. Stop by here and ask what to order as itt  did not disappoint. I will Jones for the pasta when I am not in Toronto!"
Taverna Mercatto	2	2019-12-19	"This is definitely Italian food for the after-work crowd, a Buca di Beppo-type of experience that didn't leave that much of an impression on my palate. It wasn't that the food was badly executed but rather that the plates were by-the-numbers unmemorable. I was here with the same dozen people I had been with for the previous eight hours, so small talk opportunities had already been exhausted as we sat closely together at a communal table. Because of the size of our party, I was able to try quite a number of their dishes and got a reasonably broad cross-section.

The common adjective connecting the plates was 'bland'. We started with the $14 Calamari Fritti which apparently came with shishito peppers that had disappeared by the time the plate was passed to me (photo: http://bit.ly/35MxgSg). Meh. I did manage to snag one of the overly chilled prawns on the $21 Shrimp Cocktail platter (photo: http://bit.ly/2EE5UBy). Better were the $13 Beets & Burrata with arugula and toasted almonds (photo: http://bit.ly/34Lnhva) and the $12 Greens which added celery hearts for crunch and a drizzle of sherry vinaigrette (photo: http://bit.ly/36TVmKG). The pasta plates were pretty standard issue given the couple of bites I was able to get of each.

The $21 Linguine di Mare was a typical seafood melange with little imagination (photo: http://bit.ly/2PGtJ22), while the $18 Tortiglioni alla Bolognese at least provided meatiness in the veal & pork ragu, but again it was bland and lacked freshness (photo: http://bit.ly/373WnjJ). The three different pizzas disappointed. The $18 Verdure had toppings and a basil pesto that were rather skimpy on the chewy crust (photo: http://bit.ly/38R3Y6R). while the $17 Margherita was just wet (photo: http://bit.ly/2Q1UXzi). Only the $19 Prosciutto was reasonably good with the padano cheese and prosciutto more plentiful (photo: http://bit.ly/34GULe2). 

Dessert came on cutting boards, and they offered a trio of which truthfully I only tried the Tiramisu Cake Roll which was OK (photo: http://bit.ly/2M8ukaH). There was also Chocolate Budino and Cannolo though my colleagues grabbed those pretty quickly (photo: http://bit.ly/36UM69j). My favorite part of the meal? The $14 Pimms Cup with ginger ale, lemon & cucumber, which honestly hit the spot far more than any of the food (photo: http://bit.ly/2SarzJH). Listen, none of us had high hopes for culinary delights here, and even our sponsor admitted this was not her first choice, but the proximity to our hotel just made it so convenient.

FOOD - 2.5 stars...standard issue Italian with few surprises
AMBIANCE - 2 stars...loud and rather packed after work
SERVICE - 2 stars...nothing special 
TOTAL - 2 stars...not worth seeking out unless your expense account covers it

RELATED - Traveling to Toronto? Here's a collection of places I've tried and reviewed: http://bit.ly/2LETSfV"
Taverna Mercatto	3	2019-10-24	"A last minute decision as we were staying at Delta Toronto a 2 minute walk from our hotel!

Love the drink list: wine, beer, cocktails. A great place to have a drink with snacks. 

We seated by the bar area, so one of the bartenders was serving us. We were checked on frequently and the service was attentive.

Food was ok, quite standard and did not wow me. I though will come back or a night cap if I am in the area."
Taverna Mercatto	4	2019-10-17	"YUM! What a nice, unexpected, find! We were walking around the area for the Tower and the Aquarium, and stumbled across this place near our parking garage. We were the only people in there when we first arrived. The hostess was welcoming and we decided to sit up at the bar area. 

Our server was quick to grab us some menus and take drink orders. They have a decent sized menu and the pasta was noted as something to get in reviews, so I went with that recommendation. Per usual, fellow Yelpers didn't let me down. They were happy to do spaghetti noodle with their bolognase sauce, despite it not technically being a menu option. 

Food was fresh. The noodle were perfectly al dente. The sauce tasted great and had a decent amount of meat in there to make it very hearty. 

Overall: A
Great spot near some tourist things to do, so grab a bite, a drink, and refuel for more adventuring!"
Taverna Mercatto	4	2019-10-13	"I visited Taverna on a weekday afternoon for a work lunch. There was a large group of around 12 of us there that afternoon. We had made a reservation in advance so we had no issues getting a table. 

The menu was pretty expansive and had a nice selection of salads, antipasti, pizzas and pastas. The table got a nice variety of pizzas and pastas. I went with the Bianca pizza with potatoes and mushrooms and caramelized onions. For servicing such a big group, the food arrived quickly which was something important to us since we had to get back to work! 

My pizza was excellent. A nice balance of sweetness from the onions as well as a savoury flavour from the mushrooms and cheese. The cheese on the pizza was quite strong (I think it was Gorgonzola) so it added nice flavour to the pizza without overpowering it. The crust was also very thin and cooked well without being burnt or crispy. The size of the pizza was also great. I was able to get through 3 slices and have a couple left over to take home :) The others from my table also commented on their pastas being well cooked and flavourful. 

What really stole the show was the dessert. We weren't planning on getting dessert but when the server explained to us what was on the menu, we couldn't resist. A few of us got the gelato trio which came with a little biscotti on the side. I went with the pistachio orange cannoli and omg it was incredible. The pastry cream on the inside was sweet and also tarte with a refreshing orange flavour. The pistachios added a nice crunch and the cannoli shell was also sweet and slightly flaky. I highly recommend getting dessert here! 
 
For a work lunch or even a nice date, I think Taverna is a great spot for authentic Italian food at an affordable pricepoint."
Taverna Mercatto	5	2019-08-03	"I was skeptical to visit because of the low rating but it was amazing. 

I ordered the carbonara, diavola pizza and creme caramel for dessert. 

The carbonara was perfectly seasoned, with al dente pasta. I couldn't stop eating it and almost ordered a second plate. The pizza lacked cheese but had a nice kick. 

The dessert was interesting with hints of basil and orange but it was decadent and worth a shot. 

Must have: Get the carbonara!"
Taverna Mercatto	4	2019-06-21	"This happened go be my first official food destination stop in Toronto and I must say, i'm satisfied with this place. My 4 stars is really for the views and the setting of place, very nice but the food was pretty good too. 
Started off with the arancini balls. I didn't expect the big ball of melted cheese on the inside (which made me not like it that much) but my main dish, the Bucatini, was well seasoned. One thing with pesto on pasta, it tends to be oily but besides that, I loved the chopped pistachios on top and the shrimp was juicy. Delish!"
Taverna Mercatto	3	2019-08-13	"I'm still so full writing this review; which is usually a good sign!

The service was good all night, including the full glass of water my boyfriend knocked right off the table that was immediately cleaned up, so that aside:

We started with a bottle of wine, Priorat, which was delicious! About ($100), a great Spanish red, highly recommend.

First came out the calamari ($14) delicious but quite a small portion, more for one person than it was shareable.

I got the Carbonara (basic and $18), it wasn't at all spectacular, in fact it wasn't even memorable. And the portion was not that large either.
My boyfriend got the 8oz ($38) and the cook was perfect, while the star of the dish was the layered potato serving oh my 

Followed up with an Amaretto, and a tiramisu for me (creamy, flavourful, large, filling, delicious!!!) and a caramel something for my boyfriend (also creamy and delicious!)

Highly recommend dessert over everything else we had! It's a cozy place to go after work, but not that impressive really. I'd call a 3.5/5 an accurate rating! 

Pictures attached!!

Will I be back? Unlikely, maybe just for that tiramisu some time"
Taverna Mercatto	3	2019-11-20	I landed in Toronto on the day it was snowing a lot. It was the beginning of the snow season. After checking into Airbnb, I was looking at nearby places to have a good meal. I tried to visit this place. The ambience is pretty nice and the staff was very friendly and welcoming. I went onto try their spaghetti. I didn't like it much as I felt it wasn't properly cooked plus it didn't have much flavor. I finished my meal with Caramel Coppetta dessert (Cookie Crunch Gelato with Roasted Peanuts) and Tiramisu. Tiramisu was again a let down but I loved the Caramel Coppetta. So, overall I would say the experience was pretty average.
Taverna Mercatto	3	2019-11-15	This is go to for us before a game. The food is consistently good. Service is also good with a good offering. Considering the area, it's good value for the money. Atmosphere is quite lively. Pizza is very good ... wood fired. Friendly casual environment. Good place to visit even if you're not attending a game.
Taverna Mercatto	5	2019-05-04	"Was craving some good old pasta as we tumbled upon this italian restaurant while looking for an early dinner before seeing a show at the Scotiabank Arena (literally only a 5 minute walk). Came here for the first time on a friday evening around 5:30pm, we were seated immediately but the place was already half filled and by the time we placed our order it was pretty full. 

We ordered the Arancini appetizer to share, and i was tempted to get another order! I highly recommend you to try this appetizer. It's really easy to share as well, it comes with 3 pieces of deep fried mushroom risotto balls with a delicious spicy tomato sauce that accompanies it perfectly. I was so sad when the waiter took away the plate so quickly before I could get the rest of the tomato sauce! 

We also ordered the carbonara and bolognese pastas to share. Their pasta is perfectly cooked al dente and the flavours are well balanced. Having recently returned from Italy a few months ago, this place really does compare. Tables around me all ordered pizzas and they looked pretty good, will definitely try it next time i come back. 

Whats an italian feast without dessert? You know we had to order some tiramisu to complete our meal and i am so glad we did! Their tiramisu is made the right way, this is not your typical store bought cake where you get a rectangular-cut piece of cake. Their tiramisu is made in-house ~ the soaked lady fingers were so soft and the marscapone was just right. I will definitely be coming back, especially for this tiramisu!"
Taverna Mercatto	2	2019-09-05	"Came here for a late lunch with my boyfriend. Love the ambience and the decor of this place. Unfortunately, this was the highlight of the entire meal. Service was very lack-lustre, perhaps we caught them at a time when they were recovering from the lunch rush. A bit disappointing considering there were only a couple of tables and you'd think service would then be on point.

We shared the frutti di mare, some olives, and the chitarra carbonara, and a couple of glasses of wine. The frutti di mare was quite fresh, but the portion was quite small considering the price point. The olives were pretty delicious and was a great little appy. Unfortunately, the carbonara, which looked amazing was flavourless, dry, and lacked any seasoning. The egg itself was fantastic but barely provided any flavour or added any creaminess to the pasta.

I was really looking forward to finding a staple Italian restaurant nearby, but with all the other Italian restaurants in the area, I can't really think of any reason, why we'd come back to Taverna Mercatto."
Taverna Mercatto	3	2019-04-14	"Came for dinner on a Friday night with a girlfriend before a night out. Your typical downtown core restaurant. The vibe is casual because it's near the CN Tower, Skydome & ACC; everyone's in their game gear & it's really loud inside.

Service is fine, nothing really stood out to me - pretty standard job. It took a bit longer than I'd hoped for our food to come out, but it was kind of busy since the jays game was starting/ending. We were also really hungry while waiting, so it might've felt longer.

The food tasted pretty good! I got a seafood linguine, even though I don't normally like to work for my food but the mussels were awesome. I got an okay portion size - slightly lacking in noodles, but my friend got the egg yolk carbonara and it was actually so small, I felt bad. I don't really think it was worth the price of the dish because of the small sizes.

Overall, I probably wouldn't come back. There are better places to get pasta that might be just a bit farther of a walk."
Taverna Mercatto	4	2019-10-06	We made a last minute reservation here for four on Saturday. The service the food and the ambiance was on point. I had the 8oz prime rib steak with fries. The steak was delicious and cooked to perfection. The fries were crispy and had a very nice dip to dip them into. One friend had gnocchi, orecchiette pugliese and there was another pasta dish. I would say the portions for the pasta were small. We ended up having to order arancini for the pasta people to be full. They were delicious.
Taverna Mercatto	5	2020-01-04	Loved the eclectic decor!! We had the beet and kale salad-delicious!! Pesto bread- so good and the spaghetti pomodoro- amazing!!! We will be back!!
Taverna Mercatto	5	2020-02-07	One of the best Italian restaurants I've been to! For not having reservations we were seated immediately and taken care of quickly as well. From the Arancini to the suuuper thin crispy margherrita pizza to carbonara and the BEST moscato I've ever had in my life. Went here almost a year ago and STILL think about this meal and crave it pretty frequently. Definitely a must if you're in the area!
Taverna Mercatto	2	2018-12-22	"Came here for a team lunch and ordered the fixed menu because the main menu apparently wasn't fully available during lunch.....very confusing menu setup but ended up ordering the risotto and cheese fried balls and the roasted chicken.

The risotto cheese balls were surprisingly good because when the dish arrived it was very underwhelming. The balls had a really good crust and when i fried poked into one it had a really good cheese pull. What i also enjoyed was the tomato sauce at the bottom which cut the oiliness of the fried balls significantly, a really good match.

The chicken however was very disappointing. The chicken was very tender on the inside but that was probably because small chunks were undercooked and raw ish....the pasta under was kind of dry and clumped together. Lastly the texture was a little boring, there was a little bit of char on the skin but seems to be only from the salamander so the really wasn't a real crust on the chicken.

Overall the restaurant seemed good but just didnt get a good experience this time."
Taverna Mercatto	5	2019-11-25	We came here for a friend's surprise birthday party on Friday and we really appreciated how the manager went out of his way to ensure we actually surprised her. We needed the table by 8:30pm but the table before us was just wrapping up. To make up for this, he gave us a bottle of rose and glasses to welcome her the moment she came in. He also waived the cake cutting fee, which would've been $2 per slice for 16 people. I would highly recommend Taverna Mercatto if you need to book a large party without a minimum spend!
Taverna Mercatto	4	2018-12-04	"After arriving in Toronto for lunch, we were famished and on our last leg. I had saved this place on Yelp because we could walk to it from our hotel and man, did we luck out. The hostess said it would be a thirty minute wait, but at the last second a table freed up and we were seated with Matt. 

Let me say this is the loudest restaurant I've ever been to. Of course, TM is located near the business district; therefore, it was packed with business lunches in progress. The noise didn't bother me whatsoever and even provided me with so much to watch.  

Industrial vibes were resonating from this  establishment and the bar scene seemed to be alive and well. Matt made a great wine suggestion of the Ripasso Red and we started with calamari and a simple greens salad. Salad was enjoyable, but the calamari was just a tad salty. 

Knowing we were 20 minutes from falling into a deep sleep (from flying since 4am), we opted for quick pizzas - me, Margherita and him, Pepperoni. Both were good and filed us as we thought it would.

Great lunch place, but go early to get a seat."
Taverna Mercatto	3	2019-03-29	"i tried this place out on a week night for my birthday w.3 of my gfs. we ordered 4 pasta dishes and a charcuterie board to share. our server (short redish hair) didnt seem enthused all night..not sure if thats just how she was..but definitely not on the friendly side. she seem quite hostel towards us than the other server we saw.. but we made our own night fun w.each other! 
service 3/5.

the salami charcuterie board was ok..nothing in particular wowed us with it. she brought it out and dropped it on our table. no explaination as to what was what..didnt know which salami/cured meat was which..didnt even know which cheese selection they had given us either.. it wouldve been nice to know what we were feasting on..i know my friend requested more salami and a cheese that wasnt so strong. i think they gave us brie cheese..

we then got the 4 pastas: orecchiette, bolognese, pappardelle & carbonara.
all of it was really good! forgot to ask for the pastas to be cooked a little more well but the flavours are nice.
braised rabbit was tender. fennel sausage had a nice kick. bolognese meat sauce was delicious carbonara wasnt overly creamy.

overall food 4/5.

atmosphere was nice. dim lit, cute little lights hung through out. lots of seating and tables throughout the place. not sure how busy it would be on a weekend..but id love to come back and try their pizzas!"
Donatello Restaurant	5	2020-03-01	"Dinner here was great! The service and food were amazing and I will definitely be coming here again the next time I'm in Toronto. The restaurant was walking distance from the UofT building I was working at. This was a really great getaway from the snow storm that was happening outside. We walked in without a reservation and were seated immediately. 

The bruschetta appetizer was very tasty and fresh. They had these cute little olive oil and vinegar dispensers on the table with the oil on the outside part and an olive shaped insert in the middle with the balsamic vinegar. Definitely a nice touch. 

The penne arrabiata and seafood special were delicious. The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and the sauce was tangy and spicy. We were offered fresh black pepper and parmesan as well. I ordered a glass of valpolicella ripasso, which took me back to when I was in Italy last year. 

The tiramisu was also unique - it had a different liquor in it, I think it was sambuca. It gave it a very unique flavor and we loved it. Definitely will be back."
Donatello Restaurant	3	2020-02-09	"My group and I came here to celebrate a birthday. There were issues with the reservation, as they had only called to confirm the day of the event, and we found we weren't being treated appropriately because of it by the hostess/first waiter upstairs that we received. It also may have been because of young age compared to the rest of their customers. If you plan to visit, make reservations and make sure there are no miscommunications before arriving. 

They ended up being able to accommodate us and our new waiter downstairs was very friendly and helpful. Despite the service in the beginning, it was quickly turned around with good service and great food. I ordered the gnocchi and it was delicious and filling. 

This place felt more like a date spot than a spot for large parties, there are a few floors, but it's still small. The food would be 5/5 for me but with the initial service, had to give it a 3."
Donatello Restaurant	5	2019-12-20	"I reserve this restaurant often on behalf of my colleagues for corporate meals. It's a top choice due to its ideal downtown location, right by our offices and the subway. I've also heard many good things regarding the service, delicious food and intimate atmosphere (difficult to find in downtown Toronto). 

Recently, I reserved the Rafaello room for a Holiday lunch for 25 people and was able to attend myself. This room holds up to 45 people but the staff organized the tables in a way that made the room feel intimate and appropriate for the amount of guests we had. To reserve the room, there were options for fixed menus which were all reasonably priced and offered enough options to keep all of our guests happy. I was able to experience the delicious food first hand and was most pleased with the attentive service and beautiful space, decorated for the holidays. 

I will continue to reserve this restaurant for corporate meals, now with a new confidence to do so and would definitely consider hosting larger, private events here in the future. 

Great place!"
Donatello Restaurant	4	2019-12-22	"Tiny spot in the over saturated commercial mess that is Yonge-Dundas, Donatello is a welcome institution. I can't emphasize how small this place is but well worth the cramped space for the gnocchi. Absolutely delicious. 
I've been twice; service was great even with a Saturday evening walk-in (my sister and I got the last table - score!)"
Donatello Restaurant	5	2019-08-15	"Gorgeous patio, friendly service, and amazing food. This place feels like you are dining at an Italian house. They have an extensive menu, and the portion sizes are pretty big. We tried Caesar salad, gnocchi and the salmon dish plus a dessert which was really good but I don't remember the name of. Everything was delicious. They are really generous with their parmesan, which they only add to each dish after serving it to you. Service was great; we ended up chatting with our server in the end for a while who turned out to be such a lovely person! They put a lot of effort into making their patio look good. I recommend reserving a table on the upstairs patio. The tree right in front of the restaurant is decorated with lights and it makes the whole place so beautiful and romantic with all the lighting and colourful flowers. 

I liked everything about this restaurant. Will be back for sure to try their other dishes."
Donatello Restaurant	5	2020-01-28	Small, quaint, welcoming  Italian restaurant.  Food is.  Staff is so pleasant and attentive.  Try and come back every time I am in Toronto.
Donatello Restaurant	2	2018-08-23	"Recommended:
Veal marsala with penne

Ok:
Shrimp and scallops in wine sauce

Meh:
Roasted bell peppers. They're ok, but the quantity makes no sense unless you have a group to share with.

This type of food is really not my thing. A bit too straight forward and bland.

The food is simple Italian, but not special. The veal was well seasoned but a bit chewy. Still it was better than the shrimp and scallops dish, which contained small scallops and shrimp which seemed overcooked or reheated.

Olive oil and vinegar bottles are covered with corks which are very greasy. I have no idea how these could possibly be clean. Your fingers get dirty at minimum.

For the price, I expect higher quality or at least more interesting food.

Service was a bit absent at times, but passable overall. They only have one credit card machine, which created a bottleneck of a few minutes. It didn't matter this night, but if you have a time constraint, it is not a fast meal. The waiter explained and apologized, at least."
Donatello Restaurant	4	2018-07-19	"Came here with the hubby and a friend for a casual dining evening and enjoyed our time here. 

It's something between a casual and formal dinner setting and right in the middle of downtown. They have multiple seating options which is amazing. They had an outdoor patio, indoors on the first floor and a balcony available for seating. On a summer evening, sitting outside was just perfect! 

We ordered some prosecco and enjoyed our drinks when we got some bread and oil. The service was decent but we did feel that they were prioritizing some other customers over us. People who came long after we did got served their bread and drinks while we waited for us. 

Our food was tasty - we got the specials (salmon and pasta) and the chicken in a rose sauce from the menu. Both were delicious. 

The rooftop patio/balcony is where we sat and it was beautiful. I highly recommend sitting outdoors if possible during a warm day. 

When we got our bill, the staff member added the gratuity on it automatically but it wasn't clear. When we asked him to explain what was written on it he started saying something very random which didn't make sense. We had someone else come and explain it to us that it was the gratuity. I did feel that the serving staff could do a bit more to make a better experience in terms of service. But overall this place gets a 3.5 to 4 Star for its food and ambience experience."
Donatello Restaurant	3	2019-08-17	Food was mediocre at best I'm sad to say. The pastas and salads were very generic and like I can make that myself at home. Bread was warm which was nice and the atmosphere of both the outside downstairs/upstairs patios and the interior was nice.
Donatello Restaurant	3	2018-12-02	"Super average food with inflated prices. It's a small place so you have to make reservations even on a week night. 
The veggie pasta that I got (linguine with cream sauce and mushrooms) costed me 20 bucks without tax. The pasta was al dente which I liked but lacked much flavour. The portion size on the other hand was big. 
The calamari was also around $20 but was well cooked. I just wish we got more pieces :( They charred it nicely but by the time it made it to our table it was cold. 
The sever talked super fast but was friendly and happy. Not sure if I will return because I wasn't impressed with anything!"
Donatello Restaurant	5	2019-03-24	"Top 5 best meals and service I've ever had! The wine suggestions were on the spot. We ordered the Bruschetta and cocktail shrimp, which was a nice start. Several of us agreed the cocktail sauce was one of the best we've had.  

The entrees were all delicious. I had the Butternut squash ravioli. So rich and flavorful. It's Not on the menu so you have to ask for it if it's not announced on the specials. 

Honestly, after trying my friends dishes as well, I don't think you can go wrong here."
Donatello Restaurant	3	2019-09-21	Donatello's has a great decor and great atmosphere. The staff were extraordinarily attentive and friendly. The cost/performance ratio of the food is however a little wanting. I had the mussels which was quite tasty but a bit skimpy for the price. The veal marsala was pretty average at best. The other notable dish was the egg plant salad which is quite imaginative with a layer of pineapple in the middle. All in all, a pleasant experience but would not rush back.
Donatello Restaurant	5	2018-04-14	"I was craving gnocchi so my friend took me here for ny birthday. It was extremely classy, even the exterior of the building was quaint. The server was extremely attentive and even used a special scrapper to clean the crumbs off our table after eating the crunchy bruschetta. Although there were many fancy looking appetizers, I had to choose the bruschetta as its a simple classic that I love. I tried it with the olive oil and balsamic vinegar that they had on the table as well. It was so flavourful!
The gnocchi was fresh with an amazing sauce. The server sprinkled cheese and pepper. I wish I had asked for more cheese and pepper (it looked like a lot of pepper but I actually did not taste much since it was so finely grinded).
My friend got the cheese filled ravioli. I was expecting it to be cheesy but it was a harder, more crumbly dry cheese instead. The sauce was light. It was yummy but not as flavourful as the gnocchi I felt.
Overall, I would reccomend this place to others and would love to come again to try something else!"
Donatello Restaurant	3	2018-12-04	Best crab ravioli & grilled calamari I've ever had! Friends ordered the veal marsala, a chicken special and fettuccine cream (don't remember the names) and they were flavourless. The restaurant is too cramped so it's hard to enjoy a meal without bumping elbows into the servers. Service however was really good. Would come back just for the ravioli & calamari.
Donatello Restaurant	5	2017-11-07	"This place was adorable.  Truly.  Such excellent service and we took every recommendation of our server and the pasta was out of this world.  K8 was craving pesto, so I told them she was pregnant over the phone, and hey explained that they didn't care- either way they had pesto pasta available.  It was a ravioli!  I had spaghetti 2000 (real name of the dish, very futuristic) and with their special tomato sauce with a touch of cream (also recommended).  I was upset with myself for having eaten at all earlier that day. I assure you, I will be having spaghetti 2000 for breakfast.  I actually ate a lot of it, so tomorrow morning it's spaghetti 1,500 and pesto for my baby.  A MUST if you are in the mood for Italian food, charming ambience and the kind of staff you would like to join your extended family. 

BRAVISSIMO!"
Donatello Restaurant	4	2019-12-07	We were working on a project in Toronto, and asked our concierge to recommend an Italian restaurant.  He said there was one near the hotel, but if you want a good one, it was 15 min walk.  He was right, it was worth the 15 min walk. The appetizers were excellent and entrees as well. I had an excellent tortellini dish with sausage and my co-worker an excellent pasta and clams dish.  The restaurant was packed for a Thursday night.
Donatello Restaurant	4	2017-09-02	From beginning to end a wonderful dining experience. The service was expert and unobtrusive, very attentive with several servers assigned to each table. The ceasar salad was very credible, better by far than most, followed next by one of the best Spaghetti Pescatore's I've had. The dish had mussels, manila clams, shrimp, calamari and scallops; there was no shortage of good quality fresh seafood. A very light tomato based sauce reduced with a seafood stock dressed the perfectly cooked aldenti pasta. A good quality Red Velvet cake is very hard to fine has been my experience not at Donatello there's is one for the ages. The restaurant has it all together, you will find that menu items are made fresh to order  so expect wait times to be longer but well worth the delay.
Donatello Restaurant	3	2017-09-24	"A girlfriend took me here for my birthday celebration. Loved the ambience here, and we were lucky enough to be seated on the upper deck patio. Beautiful space - the deck was covered by a huge tree decorated by fairy lights. This made it feel like we were in a completely differently place altogether, away from the hustle and bustle of Downtown Toronto. 

The room next to the upper deck had a family celebrating a birthday; and there was a lady playing the accordion for them. Almost felt like we were in Italy!

I'm giving this restaurant a 3 stars rating solely because of the food. I had the Zuppa Di Pesce, which I asked the sauce to be replaced with the rosé sauce.  I wasn't very impressed with the pasta considering the price. Both in taste and in the seafood quality. 

Service at this restaurant was great - we casually brought up that it was my birthday and they brought a complimentary tiramisu as a surprise! So wonderful! 

I would certainly come back here for drinks/appetizer considering how amazing the space is!"
Donatello Restaurant	4	2018-10-08	Excellent Italian taste , try the bruschetta for starters and the Zupe de mare dish see photo for main dish , end it with the red velvet tasty cake .
Donatello Restaurant	5	2017-12-30	"Great service, food super fresh and tasty, love the fact that they let you use cheese on my sea food if I want but it was really good that I didn't need too. Food came in a good time.
Totally recommended."
Nodo Restaurant	5	2020-05-31	"Pre-Covid review - 

My partner and I have been wanting to come here since we moved into the neighbourhood a year ago.  We have heard great things from several people and finally decided to come for our anniversary dinner.  

The decor is quaint, yet modern.  We were seated at our table, and our waitress came over to tell us the specials.  We wanted to try everything on the menu but settled on splitting the Arancini, the Caesar salad, one of the pastas (I can't recall now) and the tiramisu.  We devoured every bite.  We were the perfect amount of stuffed at the end of it.  The service was fabulous, and we did not feel rushed at all.  

I really like their menu.  They have a lot of traditional Italian dishes, but add their unique flavour.  I also liked the variety of pastas that they have."
Nodo Restaurant	4	2019-04-15	"I had the chance to explore the St Clair area and tried an Italian restaurant. Nodo Hillcrest is a smartly designed space with lots of mirrors, funky lights, and extensive use of pastels.

Okay let's get to the food. I had the Regina Pizza as a sharing. Fior di Latte, tomato sauce, fresh basil on thin crust. Delicious and delightful thin crust it was an excellent appetizer.

As a main I had the Orecchiette Rapini E Salsiccia. Homemade Italian sausage crumbled, garlic, rapini and mascarpone made for a very delicious subtle dish. The pasta was al dente perfect.

The restaurant was like it came out of a magazine. Except one thing. PLEASE replace the centre mirror panel. It's cracked and I couldn't stop looking at it."
Nodo Restaurant	5	2019-03-28	"I booked Nodo for a big birthday dinner of 20 guest and from the very initial interactions with the team here, it was a fantastic experience. I was initally dealing with their Junction location but my group grew too big for that spot so we booked the back patio section of their Hillcrest venue and I was dealing with Tony via phone and email and he was incredibly accommodating and quick with the communications. Note: they do no take reservations unless it's for a large private space booking. 
We went with their $65/person set menu option of which I was able to choose the apps (Olive knots, bruschetta pizza and Frito Misto) of which the olive knots were my favs having some of the warmest and delicious olives I've had.
I also ordered in addition to that their meat and cheese platters, which were great and quickly devoured!

For the mains we ordered their Garganelli which was a huge hit even with the strongest of meat fans in our group. At this point we were all well and stuffed and had no idea that the meat/fish/chicken options would be as large as it was, and then we also had to make room for their dessert platter with bread pudding, chocolate molten cake, canoli and gelato, all so heavenly!

I must make special mention of their custom cocktails too, everyone loved their drinks and it was also my first go at having ""artichoke liqueur"", great wine list too!

Special thanks to Christina our server, addressing everyone by name too and being a total pro at it! Such a great dinner and atmosphere! Highly recommended!"
Nodo Restaurant	3	2020-02-16	"Atmosphere in this restaurant was nice food was delicious but I can't tell you how cheap they are on their drinks
Tall skinny Glass half filled with ice maybe a quarter of a can of pop/coke you're getting $2.30 per serving it left such a bad taste in my mouth I felt ripped off really think about it your customers are paying $23 for a plate of pasta and you can't provide them a full can or a decent portion of your fountain drink really really cheap and I've never seen anything like it in all of my travels so for that is why I'm leaving a three star"
Nodo Restaurant	5	2019-01-28	"Was walking along this area and saw this restaurant and decided to check it out with my fiancé and I'm really glad we did! Their pastas were fresh and tasty and cooked at a good expected al dente. The burrata was a really nice appetizer to start with as it was nice and light, but creamy too. The waiters were helpful and attentive in serving us. 

Nodo is a really decent Italian place without paying an outrageous price."
Nodo Restaurant	5	2019-07-01	"This is my favourite Italian restaurant. All their pasta dishes are flavourful and it's surprising because you wouldn't think so just by looking at the dish. Unlike other Italian restaurant that drenched their pasta in sauce (don't get me wrong, I love that), most of their pastas don't have much sauce on it. Every dish tastes like a home cooked meal. I've never experienced anything quite like this.

Some of my favourites are Rigatoni/Trinacria, Gnocchi (New School)/Crema Tartufata Funghi E Mais, and Risotto/Girotondo.

I've had a couple of their desserts and I can't say there are any standouts.

I also love their complimentary bread - because it tastes good and not because it's free! I really miss the days when restaurant give out free bread before the mains."
Nodo Restaurant	5	2019-06-24	As an individual who doesn't eat cheese, I was overjoyed to see a pizza menu item that intentionally neglected that particular ingredient. The Sul Sarno pizza was nothing less of incredible. There was a burst of flavor bursting with every bite. The crust itself was cooked to perfection with a slight, purposeful char. Each menu item was authentic in nature. A personal pizza was the perfect amount of food to comfortably fill a single adult! The atmosphere created a fine dining experience and the waitstaff were attentive/ personable. I have only good things to say, and I'd definitely recommend this to a friend who's looking for a nicer meal out!
Nodo Restaurant	5	2019-04-08	"Tried Nodo tonight based on a recommendation from a work colleague. Tomorrow I will be giving this colleague a big high five. What a find! 

Nodo has the perfect fusion of rustic and culture...Italiano, of course. The staff seem to really care and provide just enough attention to the table so you don't have to wonder.

Special shout out to Emmanuel, a stand up guy and provides great recommendations. 

The food, no question, won't disappoint. We tried a variety of dishes, apps and deserts. I'd order it all again. 

Very easy five stars for Nodo."
Nodo Restaurant	5	2020-01-23	The service was really great. It was a busy dinner rush, but the servers were all very attentive and super friendly. The food was delicious! Highly recommend the Polipo e Patate ( grilled octopus and potatoes) and the Involtini De Melanzane (eggplant). The eggplant was so tasty and the tomatoes sauce was phenomenal! So simple but bursting with flavour. Ask for extra bread to dip in the sauce. The octopus was so tender and well cooked. The potatoes under were crispy and had a lemony flavour that complimented the dish so well. I got the oltraggioso pizza - the dough was perfect. Crispy on the outside, so nicely thin and chewy crust. The flavour of the pizza itself was good but add on some of the peperoncino oil, amazing! The pappardelle was also really good. Pasta was perfect, chewy with a nice bite and the sauce was so flavorful. It's a bit of a tight space so when it's busy, it is a bit loud so think more lively restaurant, rather than quiet ambiance.
Nodo Restaurant	3	2018-12-23	"It's ok. It's definitely not 4.5 lol. 

We got the prosciutto and ricotta fritters to start and those were great. Took a little too long to come out but they were redeeming. 

We got the oreciette (sp?) and duck tagliatelle and both fell short in different areas. The duck tagliatelle was definitely missing some flavour notes - probably lacking in aromatics- maybe garlic? Something was missing. The pasta was also way overdone for a restaurant and not al dente at all. It needed a lot more salt- and even though I got piles of parmesan on it, it was still under salted. 

The oreciette to me was the better of the two- the pasta was perfectly al dente and the chilli component made the taste better, but it was still missing something- hard to say what.

The tables adjacent to us seemed to really like their food so maybe it was just us.

We didn't get dessert so I can't speak for that. 

I would maybe come back and try to gnocchi but other than that, nothing really sparked my interest."
Nodo Restaurant	5	2018-07-04	"I prefer this location over the one on Dundas. The service was way better and even though it was hectic (Mother's Day) everything was delicious. 

My go-to would be the Caesar Salad & the Cacio Pepe con Pera e Noci, it's made with Pecorino Romano, cracked black pepper, pears and toasted walnuts. 

If I want some good Italian food, I would definitely come here. 

Keep Eating,
Angela"
Nodo Restaurant	5	2019-04-03	"GARGANELLI PASTA ---- 

Beautiful restaurant....cheesy, creamy dreamy pasta, the soft crunch from the cauliflower adds uniqueness to the dish. Really enjoyed and it reasonably priced! They also have a great house-made chilli oil that is a MUST add-on, while having this dish!"
Nodo Restaurant	5	2018-05-21	"NODO YOU'VE DONE IT AGAIN! 

This is my second time at Nodo but at the newer location in Hillcrest. I definitely prefer this restaurant in comparaison to the one in the Junction because THEY HAVE A PATIO! 
It is also a lot more spacious and isn't as cramped as the original location. 

1) Service: (4/5) in terms of staff, everyone was very friendly and made sure we were being serviced and welcomed. However, BE PATIENT with your food because it was about a 1hr wait for our meals. I believe this was because they really do take their time to perfect their dishes and I guarantee you that you'll taste it! 

2) Setting: (4.5/5) As I mentioned earlier, this is the second and newest Nodo location. That being said, it is definitely a lot more spacious and the backyard patio is very trendy and cute. 

3) Food: (5/5) Never disappointed with the food at Nodo. You can't go wrong with Homemade pasta?!? 

- Gnocchi Old School: I love gnocchi, but I love Nodo's Gnocchi more. I've also tried the New School on their menu and I can honestly say they are completely different but just as good. The Old School has slow cooked lamb which came out perfectly and was nice tender! It's complimented with a red sauce, whereas the New School has white sauce and mushrooms.

- Bruschetta Pizza: I was not expecting it to be as large as it was! Definitely worth your buck. It was light and fresh, not soggy, so you know they did it right! Would recommend it for a group of 3+ to share. 

- Parpadelle: I think that's how you spell it... my boyfriend ordered this the first time and couldn't resist not getting it again. It's served with a red sauce and have a nice flavour with the homemade pasta. He loved it so I'm sure you will too!

Really enjoyed our time at Nodo Hillcrest and will be back shortly! Hopefully try something new, if we don't crave the same thing as before... love it here!!!"
Nodo Restaurant	5	2019-09-13	"Want to eat fantastic Italian on the St Clair West strip without feeling like you're trapped in a steampunk wonderland? Nodo is your place!
Anyone that gives you lupini beans before your meal knows what they're doing. The rapini was perfect - just the right line between spicy and savoury, oily and charred. These guys actually serve tonnarelli and it is made in house."
Nodo Restaurant	5	2019-06-03	Cozy, modern, impeccable service, great food. Well located, easy to find parking in front. Everything was perfect !
Nodo Restaurant	5	2018-06-24	"The "" U Chiurito"" pizza will be the reason I return to Nodo. After visiting Sicily last summer, pistachio on pizza was something I constantly came across, so to find this in Toronto was more than I could have ever hoped for!

The texture of the Brussels sprouts along with the cheese, pistachio and arugula pesto make this pizza fresh, meaty (without meat!) and eating every last bite. The warm olives, the burrata, the coccoli - this place does not disappoint.

Service, ambiance, food are all on point at both locations. I would highly recommend it!"
Nodo Restaurant	2	2019-08-30	"New owner!!
Was my favourite place in the hood but noticed that the owner ship has changed and quality of the food has deteriorated. 
Less food and high priced."
Nodo Restaurant	5	2018-10-22	Very authentic Italian restaurant located on St Clair Ave (Corso Italia).  We ordered a charcuterie board and three pasta dishes.  Overall, the pastas were great, service was good and the prices are comparable to other Italian restaurants.
Nodo Restaurant	5	2018-11-24	"Reminds me of Manhattan Italian restaurants in winter. Cozy. Traditional with a bit of a contemporary twist.

The service is charming and exemplary.

Quite decent wine. I'm not much of a connoseur at all (considering I can't spell it) but I'm routinely disappointed with the selections in most places.

I had the Wild Boar which was much more tender and succulent than expected. The bread appetizer was mediocre, but everything else was quite good especially considering the reasonable price.

The vibe there is really nice too. This will be my go-to Italian restaurant from now on. Loved it."
Nodo Restaurant	5	2018-10-03	Totally authentic Italian cuisine. Great Mediterranean Seabass, goat cheese pizza and much, much more. Moderate prices and good service.  Parking on the surrounding streets.
Kit Kat Italian Bar & Grill	5	2020-01-03	"Called this restaurant later in the evening, hoping they'd be able to squeeze us in. The woman that answered the phone told us to come on in. 

Upon our arrival, it was a little busy but they were able to sit us down within 15 minutes. The lady behind the bar offered us a drink while we waited. Shortly upon receiving our drinks, we were sat. 

Simply put, the food is amazing. The staff is kind. I highly recommend this quaint little restaurant to anyone that is looking for a delicious Italian/Mediterranean eatery."
Kit Kat Italian Bar & Grill	3	2019-09-27	"A decent spot for family style Italian food. The food is not very exquisite but doesn't taste too bad either. Pasta was great but other dishes were just okay. 

Beef carpaccio: very salty and oily. Part of the beef tasted frozen. There was also a sharp bitter taste in the bites. It's supposed to be made with truffle oil but I couldn't taste any truffle.  

Veal piccata: very mediocre family style dish 

Smoke duck angelhair: the pasta was very delicious! Perfectly cooked and favoured with lots of toppings. The smoke duck was delicious too."
Kit Kat Italian Bar & Grill	4	2020-02-17	The seafood pasta was incredible! We enjoyed everything about our meal. My husband had a sausage penne with a spicy red sauce and loved his entree as well. This restaurant did a great job from start to finish. Service was good and the desserts were decent too! The only reason I'm not Giving 5 stars is because I ordered creme brûlée and it was not creme brûlée it was more of a panacata. Still great but maybe the pastry chef might be confused! I would definitely come back here and recommend for a special occasion or night out. Great wine selection too.
Kit Kat Italian Bar & Grill	4	2019-08-30	"Worth a try! Don't let the yelp rating deter you!

I was skeptical about this place on the outside, it looked like a generic tourist trap from the outside. What I found inside was not only a crowded, seemingly tiny restaurant and a quirky vibe but also friendly staff and delicious food. We got the osso buco ragu and the seafood special. Both dishes were full of flavor and huge portions."
Kit Kat Italian Bar & Grill	4	2019-07-20	"We sat at the patio which has great street view and perfect for summer. But be aware that you can't order drinks if sitting outside.

My girlfriend and I shared calamari and seafood pasta. The calamari wasn't the fried ones as I thought, but still yum, tender and juicy. The seafood pasta had shrimp and mussel was great too, love the tomato sauce they made.

The waiter constantly checked our table and added water, great service.

Overall great dining experience."
Kit Kat Italian Bar & Grill	5	2019-08-10	"Love this intimate and cozy restaurant. 
We always stop in whenever we visit Toronto."
Kit Kat Italian Bar & Grill	3	2019-05-29	"I did not choose this place myself, but a friend had reservations for our group of friends on a Saturday night. Waited about 20 minutes to be seated. It is a pretty cozy place and very packed, but I assumed that meant it was delicious too! I thought the food was much too overpriced for the portions. I chose the angel hair pasta and it just tasted like something you whip up at home for a quick meal. I admit I should have just chosen something else with more flavor, but the prices were stopping me. 
I did really enjoy the calamari salad though. It was flavorful and perfectly grilled. Delicious. 
I have to note that it was super chilly inside to the point where my teeth were chattering at the end of our meal. 
I would like to come back to try a different dish though!"
Kit Kat Italian Bar & Grill	5	2019-12-26	Great food and service. Highly recommend. If you are coming here we strongly recommend a reservation. It's a small place and very popular.
Kit Kat Italian Bar & Grill	5	2019-10-29	Was recommended by our hotel staff and was not disappointed. Food and staff were phenomenal. I will come back.
Kit Kat Italian Bar & Grill	5	2019-02-09	Great dining experience. Make sure to get a reservation. Excellent service,  excellent food! Rainbow Trout was divine! And tartuffo dessert... sublime! Couldn't have had a better meal. Everything was sensational!!
Kit Kat Italian Bar & Grill	5	2019-05-02	Perfect food, perfect atmosphere, we had a great experience in this practically cheff resturant. Prices are also reasonable
Kit Kat Italian Bar & Grill	4	2019-10-17	"Food was good, a little crowded, but loved the Italian atmosphere in the restaurant.
They were really accomodating, since some one in our party was really late."
Kit Kat Italian Bar & Grill	5	2020-02-01	Really cool looking restaurant, busy on Friday night. My friend and I waited in line to get seated, the manager  John offered to take our coats and assured us that we would get a table soon. It seemed liKe the staff genuinely trying to get everyone in as quickly as possible! Once we were seated we had an excellent bottle of wine and dinner experience! We will definitely come back!!
Kit Kat Italian Bar & Grill	4	2019-09-18	Great food. Michael was great!  But cannot order alcohol from Parklet on the street. Otherwise would be 5 stars.
Kit Kat Italian Bar & Grill	4	2019-06-08	Dropped in on a very busy Saturday night. Owner was gracious to squeeze us into a table that he needed for a reservation in an hour. Our server was very speedy, knowledgeable and gave a great wine recommendation. Bruschetta was awesome, garlic bread was super, and our entrees were perfectly portioned and flavorful. Only wish we had room to try the tiramisu. Maybe next time.
Kit Kat Italian Bar & Grill	1	2019-08-19	I can't tell you anything about the food as we left after 15 minutes and the waitress not even close to coming to our table.  9:00 at night not the time for the waitress to be telling jokes.
Kit Kat Italian Bar & Grill	5	2020-01-01	New Year 2019 trip to Toronto our Resident Inn manager recommended KitKat  restaurant. When we passed by the restaurant it did not look much from the outside. It was more like hole in the wall. However when walked in it was tiny place. The owner was very courteous. The food was excellent. The baby back ribs dish was very tasty. My daughter dish, spaghetti w//braised lamb was great.  The service was great. Highly recommend the place.
Kit Kat Italian Bar & Grill	5	2018-12-20	The staff and owner are friendly and engaging. They genuinely care about their service and deliver exceptional food. This was my first time in Toronto and I am so happy I found this place. I will definitely be back and this is definitely one of my favourite restaurants of all time now. Thank you for such a wonderful experience!
Kit Kat Italian Bar & Grill	5	2019-07-10	I really enjoyed my dinner meal at Kit Kat. I love the ambience and the food was delicious.  The owner was engaging and truly cared about our experience. When you spend your money (or your company's) you want  to feel appreciated and the food was amazing. Great place before a show or whenever!!
Kit Kat Italian Bar & Grill	5	2019-07-23	Great Italian food, perfect portions, service was fast and friendly. Highly recommend!
Dimmi Bar & Trattoria	5	2019-12-18	Went to Dimmi bar for the second time yesterday for dinner and it was just as great as I remember it, if not better! My date and I arrived around 8 to a packed restaurant but managed to grab a table without a reso with barely any wait and felt pretty lucky. For a cocktail i order the espresso martini which was super tasty! Bread came for the table free of charge! For apps, I got the ricotta dish which was amazing! It's quite sweet with the honey and the fresh fig so if you're not into sweet in your salad maybe not the best option but there were so many salad and app options to choose from! Then for the main i got the fettuccine alla ciccio. Really lovely fresh noodles with nice sized mushrooms and veg and a great sauce that was light but flavorful! My date got the agnolotti which i tried and had a really creamy sauce- so good! Overall, amazing service and food at Dimmi - will be back for the patio in the summer
Dimmi Bar & Trattoria	1	2020-02-09	"Not even going to talk about the food here because the service here was abysmal. We asked for 3 cups of hot water and were charged $1.50/cup. When we asked the waiter why they charge for hot water they mentioned that all restaurants in yorkville charge for water. After suggesting some of the restaurants  we regularly visit that offer complimentary hot water, the waitress said, ""I guess those restaurants aren't high end anyway...""

I'm sorry, kasa moto and one have $$$ and $$$$ ratings while this barn has $$. Snobs."
Dimmi Bar & Trattoria	3	2019-12-22	"Although the surroundings of a cellar-like space was nice, the overall pricey but subpar food, elementary plating/plates, and clumsy service was a let down especially in the Yorkville area.

I ordered their fish special of the night: Swordfish with a Side Salad. It was expensive, but the portion was great and the fish cooked & seasoned well!  The side salad was very basic but fresh, thankfully I had asked for the dressing on the side...especially since we previously ordered the Fried Calamari appetizer that came with some VERY greasy side salads. We ended our meal with some desserts, I tried their creme brûlée, but for $9.95 it was a rip off since the ramekin wasn't fully filled and the custard texture felt a little too whipped. Also, a little ridiculous that they charged us for hot water."
Dimmi Bar & Trattoria	3	2019-12-17	"Short and Sweet: 
The food was delicious, but the service was lacking. 

Long Story... Long: 
My friend and I both got the grilled calamari. It was delicious and well made. The calamari was a generous portion that fit the price.

The service, however, ruined my visit a bit. We had multiple different waiters, which was confusing. The one towards the end, who had given us our bill was kind and attentive, but the others were rushed, asked the same questions/clarifications multiple times, and generally felt uncomfortable.

I had asked for a balsamic reduction sauce for my order, if possible. I was told that it was, and the waiter came back with what looked like olive oil and balsamic vinegar together in a small container, which can actually be found on our table. I thought, ""this is not what I meant, but no problem."" I got charged 3 extra dollars for this, which I was both unaware of and unhappy about. Apparently they had added truffle oil, which in my experience is distinct and I can normally tell, but I could not in this instance. This is also where the added price came from.

I would have preferred being warned that there would be an extra charge and that they couldn't do the balsamic reduction sauce in the first place.

Otherwise, I did really like the dish, but the overall experience makes me want to pick another restaurant in the Yorkville area."
Dimmi Bar & Trattoria	4	2019-07-25	"What's for lunch? I didn't feel like having what was prepared at work so I went for a walk, hoping to be inspired. My wandering took me through nearby Yorkville, where there are many restaurants. Surely, I can find something there.

I came across Dimmi Bar & Trattoria and it looked interesting, with a patio in a pedestrian walkway. There were a few tables available so why not? I like Italian food.

I was greeted and seated quickly and I ordered Spaghetti with Meatballs. Simple. It arrived fairly quickly and tasted pretty good, especially with freshly grated cheese on it. The meatballs were a bit on the smaller side but they tasted good. The pasta was cooked properly and the sauce was also very good. This was a good meal!

Unfortunately, I won't be working in this area much longer but I'll try to drop in again for a meal before I leave. It was good."
Dimmi Bar & Trattoria	4	2019-06-11	"If you're too broke to go to Italy, you can pretend and come here INSTEAD!

This place is snuggled in the boujee life that is Yorkville and my oh my does the decor show it.

First off they have a beautiful patio surrounded by the stunning views, so I would highly suggest you call ahead for a reservation on the patio. (Unlike me, who only did a reservation).

ordered the FUSILLI CON POLLO and it was so good. The only thing I would say is this dish they do pack on the pesto. So I would avoid this guy if you're looking at your calories! 

The portions are actually pretty big as well. From first glance it doesn't look like a lot but the fact that I turned down my friend's pizza slice, told me A LOT of my portion size.

The only thing I would say was that I showed up for my reservation but my friends were half an hour late. During the 30 minutes, I was probably asked around 10 times if my friends were coming. Like lady please I have friends (albeit, not punctual ones). Granted definitely our fault for coming in late during a busy dinner period, but definitely felt a bit rushed from this perspective.

All in all really good vibes. I would suggest coming here if you want to impress your date and pretend to be Italian."
Dimmi Bar & Trattoria	4	2019-05-24	"This place is in Yorkville and next to Bay Station. It is quite convenient.

I've been here several times, and it never disappoints whatever I've ordered on the menu. The pizza and pasta is always spot on! So, try any and every thing!

I'd definitely recommend this place for its food and its romantic atmosphere!"
Dimmi Bar & Trattoria	5	2019-11-24	"Food was excellent!!!
We ordered a margherita and capo pizza - the sauce was incredible and the crust was literal perfection!!

We then ordered the gnocchi, agnolotti and pesto cream pasta. Let's just say that the table got real quiet because we were too busy eating!!

We then finished with the tiramisu, creme brulee and a pecan pie for dessert. All three were super delicious. Tiramisu seemed to be made in house, super moist. Creme brulee had a hint of cinnamon with a perfect glassy surface of sugar. And the pecan pie was warm and decadent, almost resembling a brownie.

No complaints - service was impeccable.

Highly recommend."
Dimmi Bar & Trattoria	3	2018-08-10	"Dimmi was ok but it wasn't anything special. My husband, daughter and I were in Toronto for a quick family vacation. After sight seeing we went to Yorkville to shop. Of course all of the shopping made us hungry. We walked up and down the street to find something to eat. We finally decided on Dimmi. I had a taste for pasta and thought this would be a good choice. It was pretty busy but there was no wait. The staff was very nice and accommodating.

When we first got there my husband and I ordered drinks. He got a Old-Fashioned and I got a Sangria. He enjoyed his drink. My drink started off good but then started to taste like medicine the more I drank it. Needless to say I didn't finish it.

We started our dinner with ordering the Kale as an appetizer. Of course this was a side salad. It consisted of shaved kale with pinenuts and cranberries covered with pecorino cheese in a lemon and olive oil dressing. This salad was very good. The flavors were nice and most of all I enjoyed the pinenuts. They added a nice crunch to the dish. 

For our entrees I ordered the STRO ZZAPRETI ALLA ERNESTO and my husband ordered the Roasted Chicken Breast. My dish consisted of spicy nduja sausage, rapini and cherry tomatoes in garlic and olive oil. This was something different for me but good. The sausage added a nice hint of heat but not too spicy. The pasta was good. It also had cherry tomatoes and spinach. I could have done without the spinach. I like spinach in salads or creamed spinach but I don't like plain cooked down spinach. The texture is odd in my opinion. Other than that this dish was good.  My husband's dish came with vegetables and roasted potatoes. The chicken was pretty tender but flavorless. The whole plate was flavorless for that matter. It was very bland and needed seasoning. My husband ate it but he wasn't thrilled. 

Last, we ended our meal with a dessert. We ordered the Apple Crumble. It came out in a slice but instead of pie crust topping it had a crumble topping. It came with a scoop of ice cream. This dish was decent. It was pretty tasty. It's one of those things that is wasn't bad but it wasn't the best we have had. 

Overall, Dimmi was ok. We enjoyed it but it wasn't anything special."
Dimmi Bar & Trattoria	4	2018-12-31	"If you're on a diet, you shouldn't even be looking at this place. You can have a water. 

This is a cute authentic Italian joint in Yorkville. It's small, dim and cute - giving it a really intimate and date-night worthy effect. The staff are very nice and service is perfect. The menu is the perfect size with your typical pizzas, pastas and hot sandwiches. I had the dimmi pizza, topped with grilled chicken+spinach+mozz. It's thin crust and cooked perfectly, you actually don't feel stuffed or sick eating it. The other pizzas looked soooo good too- the funghi one had truffle oil...DROOL!
The pastas all looked good but none of them really came with any protein, so we didn't really bother with them. 
The salads also looked pretty plain for around the same price as a pizza, so I'd recommend just going for the pizza and being happier. 

It's pretty pricey for a regular night but honestly not too bad for Yorkville. I'd definitely come here again for some yums - it's such a sweet place to be spoiled."
Dimmi Bar & Trattoria	4	2018-06-09	"I haven't visited Yorkville much. I usually come here for business dinners, go to ROM on occasion and once in a while take a sneak at the high end stores that line Bloor.
 
When my partner in foodies suggested this place-I knew it would be a good choice. We got a court side table for two at there limited outdoor Terrance facing the Yorkville alley. Overhead and across from us the Japanese restaurant, Kimono, started it's rooftop terrace which turns into a club later in the evening. They started their house music.

Our waitress was welcoming, riciting the evenings' meal specialties while making sure that each choice we made was accompanied with either ""is there anything else"" or ""how did you like your meal/drink""

We ordered straight from the menus, we both eyed several pasta dishes of which we targeted two of their signature creations.

We ordered also glasses of red Chauvignon which complemented our main meal choices well

Dimimi has been a staple main stay for several years and it hasn't been deterred with other new competition over the years.

$$-$$$"
Dimmi Bar & Trattoria	4	2019-09-28	We sat on the patio and had really good service however it was kind of shocking that a side salad was $14. I ordered they Penne Aribiatta and it was extremely spicy but the waitress did warn us.
Dimmi Bar & Trattoria	5	2019-09-14	This restaurant is walking distance from the subway station/paid parking. Food is amazing! Great customer service and atmosphere. I ordered the antipasto for 2 and gnocchi with a glass of wine.
Dimmi Bar & Trattoria	2	2018-12-11	"I found this place while walking around Yorkville. I came without reservations but I was seated quickly as the restaurant was fairly empty on a weeknight. 

The restaurant is pretty spacious. They have a private dining room on the upper level for large groups. The ambience is upscale and relaxing.

Service:

The server was nice but she wasn't around very often. I had to wave another server down for more water since my assigned server barely checked up on my table.

Food:
Calamari Fritti - The calamari was pretty standard.

Fettucine Alla riviera -  The fettucine pasta was disappointing as the sauce was underwhelming. It was pretty bland. 

Gnocchi Alla Dimmi - The gnocchi was decent.

Overall:

Great location with a nice ambiance. However, poor service and overpriced, mediocre food. They may be busy but that may be because of their convenient location."
Dimmi Bar & Trattoria	3	2019-12-10	Came here for lunch with group of friends. Service was good and attentive. Food portion is small for the price. Finished the spaghetti meatballs and was still hungry. Probably will not come back.
Dimmi Bar & Trattoria	5	2019-12-02	Best Italian food in all of Toronto! Dimmi is yorkville a little gem. Try the Gorgonzola pizza, the seafood pasta and the cucumber salad.
Dimmi Bar & Trattoria	5	2019-03-13	This Italian spot in Yorkville keeps bringing me back for their amazing pasta. One of my goals in life is to try out every Italian place in Toronto and so far this still ranks as one of the top. Prices are reasonable for Yorkville and the food is delicious. I have tried the gnocchi alla Dimmi and the penne arrabiata, both I have ordered multiple times. The service is always on point, along with the food as well.
Dimmi Bar & Trattoria	4	2018-07-23	"Decided to try this place out on a Saturday evening and we had no regrets. This place was just great from its food to the service! 

We ordered the calamari fritti for an appetizer, the rigatoni al gargonzola and the fettuccine alla riviera. Portions were decent. The calamari was good, it also came with a little side salad on the plate. However if we didn't get an appetizer, we would have been still hungry after the entrees. The entrees were just so delicious, sauces were extra creamy and the pasta was cooked perfectly. Each dish was about $20+ which was a little bit expensive. If there was a little bit more on the plate, that would top it all off.

The service was great as well. We noticed that though we had a server for our table, a lot of the other staff came to cater to us and check in. It was nice not having to rely on our own server, which is how it usually is at other restaurants. About 5-6 people checked in with us, helped us with our bill, delivered our food, gave us more water, etc. It was a team experience for them and we appreciated that. 

Overall, we had a pleasant experience. The only single reason why it wasn't a 5 star was because there were so many fruit flies flying around. It interrupted our meals many times and also for other people who were dining around us. It was really irritating to try to take a bite and having to swat a fruit fly from my face. Everything else was amazing and we will 100% come back!"
Dimmi Bar & Trattoria	4	2018-06-03	"Really well known for a ""no frills"" experience for Italian in Yorkville. Due to it's price point, it's a popular spot for lunch meetings. 

The food is good and the service is fine. Ambiance is also just fine. It's a solid 3.5 star restaurant that doesn't strive to be anything more than it is. If you appreciate it for that, it's a great place."
Dimmi Bar & Trattoria	3	2019-10-16	It was alright, servers very friendly 5/5 food 3/5 wouldn't go out of my way to come back. VERY LOUD.
Giulietta	5	2020-05-23	"Giulietta is located on College about a short walk from Dovercourt. I had been wanting to try this restaurant for a while as I had heard good things. I decided to order takeout as Giulietta started offering this amidst the pandemic. Online ordering was a breeze on their website where I selected a particular pick up time. The pick up experience was good but I had to wait for a few minutes for my order to come out. 

I ordered the crab spaghetti and the ravioli girasole. The crab spaghetti had large chunks of crab meat and the sauce complimented and coated the fresh housemade pasta well. What a delicious dish! The ravioli girasole was also a great dish as well, very bright and had a lot of lemon flavour without it being overpowering. Overall, both pasta dishes were outstandingly delicious and simplistic in a good way. Would definitely come back to Giulietta for more!"
Giulietta	4	2020-01-30	"Giulietta has been high on my to-do list because I hear about it everywhere. Not only am I an avid fan of Top Chef Canada, where in season one Executive Chef Rob Rossi was the runner-up (he was my favourite on the show and should've won!) but the hype is real about this place in general. enRoute magazine chose them as #5 on Canada's Best New Restaurants 2018 list. Toronto Life has them on two lists; #33 on The City's 100 Best Restaurants 2018 and #3 on The Best New Restaurants 2019. And of course, the biggest of them all, they've landed at #9 on Canada's 100 Best Restaurants 2019. It has all certainly been more than enough to catch my attention. Giulietta (pronounced Julietta) is an Italian restaurant set on making classic dishes fresh and new again. And I was lucky enough to pay them a visit on a Saturday evening for my anniversary, no less.

The outside of this Little Italy-adjacent restaurant is fairly unassuming, however the inside is very sharp. A reservation is almost always a must. A lot of care and attention has gone into the stylish design of the space, creating a polished atmosphere. Muted tones are accented with copper metallics, with just a little bit of exposed brick for good measure. I was impressed by the stunning glass walk-in pantry placed right in the middle of the room. This truly added a market-quality feeling to the space and certainly invoked a certain Italian vibe. I also noted the various bar carts around the room, stocked full with gleaming bottles and glasses. The room feels quite adult and a little like an escape to Europe.

Seated at our cozy table for two, I eyed up the bustling activity in the open kitchen. Chef Rob Rossi himself did not appear to be present on this evening. Next, a thorough examination of the cutlery was in order. This might be one of the best little features to discover at Giulietta - many of the mismatched vintage flatwear are engraved with all sorts of adorable little sayings. I had a fork which read ""me too"" and an appropriately-printed spoon that said ""spoon me."" I absolutely loved this whimsical touch. Our friendly hostess and server wished us a happy anniversary repeatedly, which was incredibly sweet. I appreciated that there was no pretension to be found whatsoever, but on the other hand, I found the service almost slightly too casual. I liked that our server was quite laid-back but I found her delivery of information somewhat unpolished for a restaurant of this caliber. We were offered complimentary sparkling or still water to drink.

I was ready for a cocktail and easily selected the Giulietta Spritz (Quaglia berto aperitivo, prosecco & soda - $15.00) with the assumption that any signature drink has gotta be good. Made with a classic Italian aperitif, I loved the light, fresh bitterness. The essence was reminiscent of chinotto to me - one of my favourite flavours to accompany Italian food. The olive garnish was the perfect touch and the fact that I was provided with a small gold-rimmed dish for the pit was even better. Saluti!

The copper-embossed menu is one page long with well-laid out sections. It reads as an Italian meal should be consumed; with Primi, Secondi, and Contorni columns. Our server was helpful in suggesting some of the restaurant's top plates and my husband and I did our best to make well-rounded selections, attempting to taste as much variety as possible. Starting with the Spuntini (snacks) section, the Olive all' Ascolana (Fried Castelvetrano olives wrapped with sausage​ - $9.00) seemed like an obvious choice. This little dish was unexpected. I've never tried a sausage-wrapped olive before and I was here for it. Dusted with Pecorino, these savoury-briny bites were fried to perfection and incredibly unique.

From the same section, we also chose the Burrata Pugliese (Italian Burrata, rhubarb marmellata, gnocco fritto, black pepper &amp; basil - $27.00). It was easy to be enticed by the grilled octopus, but I had a good feeling about this one. I mean, gnocco fritto is always a major selling point in my book. Doesn't everyone love fried pillows of happiness? Burrata is a fresh Italian cow milk cheese made from mozzarella and cream. The result is an ultra-soft, practically spreadable cheese that tastes like heaven when seasoned with a bit of olive oil and salt. The gnocco fritto served as a vessel for the Burrata and a bit of rhubarb jam on top added a delightful tart sweetness. This is the perfect example of a plate that is so simple, and yet so perfect. I think that this dish was our favourite of the entire meal.

Moving to the Primi (first) section, it was time to get things going for real. All four pasta dishes on offer sounded amazing, but the Tonnarelli Cacio e Pepe (Traditional long Roman pasta, kampot black pepper &amp; Pecorino - $23.00) had to be the one. My husband and I adored this dish on our trip to Rome a few years ago and have a definite soft spot for it. An extremely simple pasta, it basically just involves cheese and pe"
Giulietta	5	2019-12-15	"Wow wow wow.


I came here after a bad experience at another restaurant and this place blew my mind.

Every dish we had was simply amazing.

We had

The octopus - so tender and the pesto was phenomenal.

The beef carpaccio - a religious experience for me. The mushrooms were cured somehow and have changed how I think about em.

The roasted squash - never knew you could make squash taste that amazing.

The papardelle - a bit too al dente for my taste, but you could really see the taste and effort they've put into this dish and I really appreciate that.

The tiramisu - just look at the photo.

A boulevardier - really well done.


The location has a small entrance but you walk in and it's actually quite large. The servers all seemed really happy and relaxed working there.

And final plus - the washrooms had product from malin and gootze which I first tried in a hotel in Istanbul and fell in love. Havent seen it anywhere else and so happy to see it here.

This is officially my fav Italian spot in TO."
Giulietta	3	2019-04-26	"This restaurant is now on the top 10 list for the best restaurants in Canada.  I came here before the list came out and I have to say I am extremely underwhelmed.  There are much better restaurants in Toronto that deserve to take its place on the list, and especially much better ITALIAN in Toronto.

I had the calamari to start which was fresh and came with some shishito peppers which was fun.  But I find nowadays calamari is pretty good at most places.  For the mains I had the ravioli (cello spinach, stracciatella, walnut pesto) which is not a dish that would bring me back to the restaurant again.  I found the walnut pesto to be overpowering and very gritty/thick, but to be fair I actually don't like walnut that much.  

The pizza I had was thin crust and just nothing amazing.  There is MUCH better pizza elsewhere all over Toronto.  I have NO idea how this restaurant made it to the top restaurant list in Canada and I will not be coming back again.  I am giving 3 stars because the service is FANtastic and the restaurant is beautiful."
Giulietta	4	2019-04-19	"This restaurant was recently voted as one of the top restaurants in Canada for 2019 - they are actually number 9 on the list. Anyone who knows me, knows how much I love Italian food, so I was really excited to try this place out. 

There were 7 of us at the table, and we discussed the possibility of having the family style meal, which is usually recommended for a party of our size. However, it wasn't easy getting everyone to agree on which dishes to try, so we all ended up ordering our own dishes. A couple of us did share a few bites, so I was able to taste a few more dishes than what I ordered for myself. This is always my favourite way to dine, so you can experience as much of the menu as possible. 

Our server did say that the menu changes with the seasons, which is great since you get the freshest ingredients at their peak. It can also mean that a favourite dish won't always be available, but it's great to try new things. 

I started out with a Negroni cocktail, which was probably the best one I've ever had. Kudos to the bartender, as it was perfection. For a starter, I had the grilled octopus - I was actually hoping it was available as an entrée, as I'd seen photos of it already. Sadly for me, it was just appetizer size. It wasn't as tender as I'd hoped, but it was really flavorful and well-seasoned. For my entrée, I had the branzino, which was served whole. It was difficult to eat because there were so many bones, and it tasted a bit overdone, but still enjoyable. I shared some of my fish with a fellow diner in exchange for a few pieces of his pork chop, which was exceptional. We also shared a side of asparagus as well as the cauliflower, the latter being a bit bland. Their namesake pizza was a big hit, with lots of pistachios and a hint of smoked cheese. 

Four of us ordered desserts, which we shared with each other, and I have to say that the lemon crostata that I ordered was very good, but the Italian custard, called Bonet PIemontese, was the standout for everyone. It's very much like a crème caramel in both appearance and texture. I would definitely order this again. Their coffee was also exceptional, although we did not get it until after we'd all finished our desserts. They really need to improve the timing on that, as most people prefer to have their coffee with their dessert. 

Service was generally quite good, although we did wait quite a while to order our food, and then again had about a 35 minute wait between the appetizers and the entrées. When they brought the bill, they advised us that they were unable to split by seat. This is usually an awkward situation, but it was made even worse by the fact that many of the items on the bill were listed in Italian, so some people were unsure of what they had ordered. It took about 25 minutes just to sort it out. I cannot understand with technology today, why the restaurant cannot split a bill. Their POS system was one of the newest and fanciest ones I've ever seen, so I'm not sure if I believe they can't do it, rather than they choose not to. 

In any case, the food was definitely good enough that I want to return, next time to try the pasta, as not one person in the group ordered any on this visit."
Giulietta	4	2019-04-17	"SERVICE:
The service was welcoming, friendly, and attentive. Our server checked up on us often and refilled our water frequently. 

FOOD:
Beef tartare - Loved this! I highly recommend

Calamari - this was very average. I would recommend skipping this and order another appetizer. 

Seafood pasta - this is one of their popular dishes. The sauce was on the lighter side but it was still tasty. Noodles were cooked perfectly.   

Carbonara - this was a daily special and it was well executed. We absolutely loved this!

OVERALL:
I had an enjoyable dining experience here and I will most likely return."
Giulietta	5	2019-04-18	"Oh my god. This place was amazing in every aspect. I came here on a Wednesday night with my coworker and we were aware of the positive reviews but this totally exceeded my expectations. It was pretty busy and we didn't have a reservation so we were seated at the bar. I didn't mind, and the service at the bar was actually phenomenal. Very attentive and friendly. They took time to wipe our table between courses and ensured our drinks were never empty.

We shared the polpo e fagiolli (grilled octopus, cannellini beans and salsa verde) and cavolgiore in paedella (cauliflower, sultana raisins, garlic, lemon and parsley) to start. The latter dish is actually a side but we had it as an appetizer. The octopus, which came highly recommended by the staff was cooked to perfection. It has a nice amount of char to it and was very crispy. The cauliflower was good too - an interesting combination with the raisins but it worked!

For the main, I got the reginelle pappardelle (slow cooked oxtail ragu, pangratto, parsley and parmigiano reggiano). It was soo tasty. There was a good amount of oxtail, and the flavours were all there. There was a crispy layer of breadcrumbs and cheese and it added a bit of texture to every bite. Loved this dish so much.

For dessert we shared the lemon crostata (lemon meringue with candied rosemary) and bonet piemontese (italian custard with amaretto, coffee and vanilla). Nothing but good things to say about both of these dishes!"
Giulietta	4	2019-09-21	"Ok, let's get this out of the way: I have no idea why this is the 9th best restaurant in Canada in 2019, and you'll be massively disappointed if you expect it to be. Checking for expectations though, it's good. We managed to grab an early dinner slot and got:
- Pulpo e Fagioli: The octopus was really tender, you could cut through it easily with the typical blunt table knife. The swipe of salsa verde and the bed of cannellini beans didn't add much flavour though.
- La Giulietta: Their signature pizza was definitely worthy of their name. This will sound weird, but my favourite part was how good the dough was - thin yet not limp, great taste but not distracting to the toppings, held everything together well. Also, never had pistachios on pizza before and thought this was a great.
- Pappardelle al Ragu: The oxtail was melt-in-your-mouth amazing, though was let down by the pedestrian tomato sauce and a-bit-too-aldente pasta noodles.
- Fogo Island Cioppino: Kinda like an Italian bouillabaisse. Good flavour, though not enough seafood (cod, mussels, shrimp) for my liking.
- Dessert: Got the Red Fife Tiramisu and Gelato del Giorno, and both were winners. The tiramisu had a nice thick custard that made it a bit different. The seasonal soft serve gelato that day was chamomile, which, drizzled with honey, was just a perfect way to end the meal.

The prices were expectedly high, the place had a nice upscale hip vibe, the servers were tremendous, though the pacing of the meal was a bit too slow for me. Overall, Giulietta provided a good dining experience. Not 9th best, maybe not even 99th best. But there were enough hits to make it a worthwhile try."
Giulietta	4	2019-09-21	"4 stars overall. It was a good dining experience though not sure if I'll be back.

5 stars for the La Giulietta pizza, tiramisu and soft serve. All of them tasted amazing. Also, kudos to the great service and decor.

4 stars for the octopus. It was well cooked and really tasty, though not the best I've had.

3.5 stars for the cioppino since there wasn't enough seafood. 3 stars for the pappardelle rage since it wasn't as tasty as it could have been."
Giulietta	5	2019-02-23	"Hands down one of my favourite Italian places in the city! This isn't your typical rustic Italian joint. Its clean and modern decor doesn't just feel Italian, but classy and upscale.

We decided to family style everything so we all got to try a bit of something. To start, we had the fried calamari, lamb sausage, octopus, and fried fior di latte. Hard to choose a favourite, but I think it'd have to be the octopus and lamb sausage. The octopus comes beautifully whole with a light pesto sauce over some beans. It was tender and crunchy at the same time. The sausage was packed with juices and flavour. One bite leaves you wanting more.

For mains, we shared the special - a squid ink tagliatelle, the parpadelle, the seafood pasta, and the pecoroni and cheese pasta. All were amazing, but my favourites were the special and the parpadelle. Each was so unique and represented such different flavours from its other menu items. That's what made it so good. Each one was so tasty.

Finally, to end the night, we shared the wildflower tart, lemon tart, and the salted chocolate hazelnut cake. Man, what a way to end the night! I would highly recommend all three, but the wildflower tart and the chocolate cake were amazing. The wildflower tart was really unique. It brought a really light flavour, but the chocolate cake was wonderfully dark and rich. When the salted chocolate hits your tongue, you're in love.

I cannot wait to come again!"
Giulietta	4	2019-03-09	"Nice selection of wines and the sommelier was super helpful! 
We got their Giulietta pizza and it was great. Also, loved their Brussel sprouts, lightly charred on one side and served with sliced almonds. Their pasta special for the night was a triangle ravioli and they were delicious. 
The octopus was tender but too salty in my opinion, too bad because we love a good octopus dish! 
They also had a burrata with speck on toast appetizer special, it was tasty but very difficult to share among 4 people. The other comment I have with most of their dishes is for an establishment that recommends sharing plates for the table, many cannot be conveniently shared. ( the burrata, the pepe long Roman pasta, the octopus wasn't pre -cut)
We had a nice time."
Giulietta	5	2019-06-25	"Overall: 5
Possibly my favourite Italian restaurant in Toronto.

Food: 5
Ambiance/Decor: 5
Service: 5
 
I have been here a couple of times now and it's one of my go to places when someone comes back to visit. The house made pastas here are amazing and cooked perfectly. Pizza is baked in a wood fired oven with perfectly thin crust. 

For appetizers I usually go for the Calamari or the Polpo e Fagioli, the octopus is sous vide for 3 hours then charred in the oven and is absolutely delicious. For pastas, you can't really go wrong with any of them. I've had the Cacio e Pepe, Oxtail Ragu, the seafood pasta, and the chestnut agnolotti. I loved all of them and can't really pick a favorite. My favourite red pizza is the L'Amentea, the soppressata adds a nice savoury flavour and a slight kick. If you prefer white pizzas, La Giulietta on the other hand is beautiful and decadent. Desserts here are also great, sweet but not overly decadent. The Torta della Nonna, Bigne al Pistachio, and the house made gelato are all great choices.  

The restaurant has seating at the bar, standard tables, and chef's table. If you don't mind it being a bit louder the chef's table is great and they brought us complimentary cheese spread to start."
Giulietta	4	2019-01-06	"Part of a longer review...

""With Giulietta, Chef Rob Rossi envisioned light yet traditional Italian cuisine. The menu was distilled down to essentials made for partager avec vos amis, starring house-made pasta, wood-fired pizza and simple but thoughtful proteins and vegetable sides.

We ordered everything just as it was meant to be eaten -- shared. The polpo e fagioli ($24) and finocchio e arancia ($16) arrived first, which we politely demolished with gusto. Pour moi, octopus is always un plat préféré, and this version was perfectly tender and charred. Naked cannellini beans and salsa verde brought some texture and spice to the dish, but not in an overwhelming manner. This was a star dish and was portion-appropriate to whet the palate before the pièces de résistance.

A testament to authentic Italian cuisine is usually in the quality of the pizza and the pasta. La pizza est bonne-- with six kinds on the menu (like La Giulietta ($22) with Sicilian pistachio, lardo di Modena, panna and smoked scamorza), all with a chewy, bubbly crust that is crisp to the bite. We ordered the more traditional L'Amentea ($21), a doughy canvas that featured light tomato sauce and a punchy kick from soppressata and garlic in every bite. It was harmonized by fior di latte and Sicilian oregano. Delicious, for certain, but nothing très original."""
Giulietta	3	2019-05-03	"Some hits and many misses; 
Always sad when slow/ inattentive or simply bad service ruins great dishes. However, the setting, the space, and the wine list are great. 

The food: although executed greatly leaves something to be desired in flavour. Simple ingredients are supposed to speak for themselves here mostly, however more ""cooked"" dishes lacked savoury or original flavours that would make you go back for specific dishes. 

The good:  Cacio e pepe is great- am I running back for it anytime, maybe. 
The disappointing: Avoid the Branzino (sea bass) if you have a problem with bones- they make no effort in deboning it before serving. 

The main issue here is service. It was exceptionally slow; had to call the staff several time for refills, orders, more wine, where's our food... etc. T
he timing between each course needed to be shortened but half if not more. I don't think they want you sitting there for 3 hours without dessert even. There were too many loooong pauses during meal staring at an empty table waiting for another round of dishes. 

With lots of great Italian options in the city I would definitely consider it more like a wine bar with a few nibbles rather than a full fledged hearty meal."
Giulietta	5	2019-05-10	"I'm putting this into the top 5 restaurants category in Toronto which is very high praise. Very impressed with the dining experience. Here's the breakdown:

Service (10/10) 
- excellent attention to detail. Informative, respectful, timely etc. They knew the menu well, they were able to explain how best to place an order which I find is often very under rated. Many servers don't do a great job of explaining this well. That wasn't an issue here. 

Ambiance (10/10) 
- modern, dimly lit and classy. Enjoyed the unique vibe and ambiance. Interesting lighting and set up with bae cart by the entrance. Washroom were very clean which is also a good reflection of how clean the restaurant and kitchen is likely to be. 

Food (9/10)
- high quality of food. We did 2 apps, split a pasta and meat dish. Best way to dine here is tapas style and to share everything. I could taste quality ingredients and very well executed overall. No issues with the food at all. Enjoyed it. 

Drink (7/10)
- this is the only area I feel they can work on. Cocktails weren't anything to rave about. Wine selection for by the glass wasn't great. Although their selection by the bottle was derailed. If they improve this they'll be taking major steps forward to best Italian restaurant in Toronto for sure. 

Price/value (8/10) 
- priced appropriately for the quality. No major concerns here. Overall great value and experience"
Giulietta	4	2019-06-12	"Good date place. The atmosphere was phenomenal. The food good but for what you pay I think you can get something  more? The seafood pasta had salty clams, I think the clams they were using was naturally salty? But a little bit too salty to eat. 
Olive stuffed sausage was amazing. The tripe roman style was good but wish it was more flavourful. All in all great place. Service and cocktails were good as wel"
Giulietta	4	2018-10-31	"My outlook improved when the burrata ($30) was set on the table. The cheese draped with thin slices of salty prosciutto, why mess with a great combination? 

Since the bread wasn't toasted or oiled, it was a bit chewy and difficult to get a knife through, so if it was cut thinner it would be even better. The caramelized onion and fig spread on the bread was absolutely delicious and went so nicely with the milky flavourful cheese, which was served at a perfect room temperature. The staggering $30 price tag was a bit of a surprise though... note to self, always ask for prices with specials.  

Well marbled beef was used in the carne cruda di chianina ($19) and while I couldn't taste the fried garlic mentioned on the menu, the anchovy was an interesting addition to the mix. We're asked if we'd like a side of bread ($3) which, in my opinion, is a must. You really need something to spread the beef tartare on or it'd be way too salty and overpowering on its own. For those that are abstaining from carbs, perhaps a salad would help balance the flavourful beef.

Even one of Giulietta's pizzas would be a great shared starter. The l'amentea ($21) has a healthy portion of spicy soppressata and tons of garlic that would give Count Dracula a scare. I love garlic so found it went nicely with the soppressata, but did drown out the fior di latte, which became more for its creamy chewy texture than flavour. The well blistered crust was coloured evenly and had a lovely chewy texture, but could be thicker in the middle as the paper-thin centre became lost amongst the sauce."
Giulietta	3	2019-05-19	"Had my bday dinner at the counter seating in front of the kitchen, a great spot to watch the chef cooking the dishes. Food was great except the pasta. It's raw, not Al dente. We ordered the octopus. The portion size of each piece has a quite big difference. Wonder if they give s bigger portion for a large table. As we only had two people, we ordered the pork chop instead of the porterhouse. It's lovely cooked with cheeky pink inside. The highlight was the dessert, pine nut tart with wildflower honey and vanilla mascarpone. It's not too sweet with balanced flavour. 
The kitchen gave us a piece of choco tarte as bday cake. It's funny that the candle light was off three times as it's windy above our seats. 
I'd love to try their pizza in the future. However I doubt if I will go again coz they don't seem like to chat with asians"
Giulietta	4	2018-09-20	"I love the ambiance and service of this place! We came for a company dinner, and got seated at the window seat. The decor of this place is quite simple and minimalistic, and the lighting is minimal and very warm. There are these warm yellow tubes and lights hanging from the ceiling, with lighting coming from the chef's open kitchen / bar.

I got a mocktail drink, the albicocca. It was a nice light drink, slightly sweet from the apricot but also balanced with the sourness from the lemon. I pointed out a chip on my wine glass, and the waitress apologized profusely and immediately switched it out. She was super kind and attentive throughout dinner.

We shared a bunch of food, all of which were excellent:

Burrata Appetizer:
This appetizer was the special of the day. There was a ball of creamy burrata topped with prosciutto, both on top of a sourdough bread spread with sweet tapenade. The mash of textured was very interesting. The mild flavour of the burrata matched perfectly with the sweetness of the spread, balanced by the salty prosciutto. It's pretty good, but a fairly small piece. We split it among the four of us, and we each got a little over a bite.

Tomato Panzanella:
This appetizer came in a small bowl; the orange and red tomatoes were well-marinated in a basil olive oil mixture. The toasted bread was fairly interesting - the once crispy bread was a little soaked and soggy from the mixture. This was interesting, but not necessarily one of my favourites.

Radicchio di Castelfranco:
The slightly bitter radicchio was coated with a slightly sweet honey dressing, creating a lovely mixture and balance. I particularly enjoyed the sweetness of the soft bosc pears, juxtaposed against the crispness of the hazelnuts. I particularly enjoyed the hazelnuts and honey dressing!

Insalata Verde:
The bibb lettuce was cut rather largely and came in whole leaves. It was nice and soft, tossed evenly in the lemon vinaigrette. Since one member of our party is vegan, we got the parmesan on the side. To be honest, I found this salad quite overpriced.

Roasted Carrots:
Miniature, adorable orange carrots sliced in half arrived in another small plate (I'm seeing a trend with the sizes). The carrots were approximately the length of my thumb, and were quite sweet! Slightly oily, but still a classic side nonetheless.

Crispy Potatoes:
These potatoes were amazing and SO flavourful! I loved how the outside was super crispy and crunchy, with twigs of rosemary coating it all. So addicting... I had a ton!

Polpo e Fagioli:
This dish comes with a whole small octopus! The octopus is tender; it was probably boiled before, but definitely grilled after! There was a nice char to the ends, which made it quite crispy. It was plated on a creamy mixture of cannellini beans, and the salsa verde was a lovely addition. To be honest, I probably had all of this dish to myself... One colleague had perhaps a leg. No problem - I thoroughly enjoyed and savoured every minute of it!

Chestnut Agnolotti:
We got this, but omitted the guanciale. It was absolutely delicious! Perfectly creamy, and the ultimate comfort food. The agnolotti was bite sized, stuffed with a nice amount of chestnut mash. I thoroughly enjoyed the sprinkled cheese and occasional wilted green! We all raved about this dish, and this was definitely one highlight of the meal.

We also ordered two pizzas - I tried the L'Amatriciana. The crusts were super thin and there was a great char. I enjoyed the saltiness of the guanciale, though I did find it a little too fatty at times.

We then shared three desserts among us four - all were utterly delicious!

Cesta di Frutta:
A lemon and basil curd came within a baked meringue base, topped with candied berries (strawberries and blackberries). The meringue was fantastic! It was the perfect chewiness and crisp. I also enjoyed the tanginess of the curd, though the lemon flavour lingers and comes out mainly at the end. 

Lemon Crostata:
This was very similar to a lemon meringue pie - the lemon curd was heavenly! A classic comfort, and topped with a dollop creamy meringue.

Torta della Nonna:
Honestly, I didn't expect I'd enjoy this much, but I loved it! The honeyed pine nuts were glorious and so nutty and addicting. The tart base was also well executed, and the mascarpone cream balanced it all - the smoothness against the crispness of the tart, the mild flavour framing the sweetness and nuttiness. Would definitely get this again!"
Giulietta	4	2018-09-20	"Our group of 7 were seated at 6pm for the early seating. We were told there's another party coming in at 8:30 so we got 2.5 hrs to dine and dash.  Personally, I don't mind the maître giving us the heads up, it allows everyone to be on the same page and respectful of others time it's really busy and our food takes extra long to come out.  

In terms of food, we ordered the seafood pasta, pepperoni pizza, fried seafood, roasted peppers, sweet corn, pork chop, carbonara and ravioli.  I ordered the seafood pasta, the noodles were perfectly cooked however the seafood wasn't the freshest specially the calamari.  The sweet corn was overly sweet, can almost be a dessert, not my cup of tea.  Aside from those two dishes, Everything else was really good. 

We didn't get a chance to order dessert because our mains took really long to come out and it was 8:15 by the time we finished. I would that that's another disappointment.  

Overall, I would say this place has great ambience, beautiful decor and super friendly staff.  It's worth checking it out."
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen	5	2020-05-10	"I finally understand what all the buzz is about! I went here to grab some food for Mother's Day, and I'm so happy I did.

Lots of people waiting for their orders but the process is super thorough so it's not an unpleasant experience. You order online on their website and receive a time to pick-up. When you arrive they have an electronic screen with order names on it,  they also call out your name if it's ready. Super painless and efficient.

I ordered the tum yum soup appetizer, chicken pad thai, Massaman beef curry, and chicken panang curry. Everything was delicious. Other reviews were right to highlight how delicious the pad Thai and curries are. The spice level I chose was ""medium"" and it was just perfect. Could have done it a bit spicier but didn't want to chance it this time around.

The portions are not large but good for two people. It's definitely packed with flavour so you're paying for quality - not quantity. Definitely worth the higher end of prices for the tastiness of the food.

Highly recommend!"
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen	5	2020-03-16	My boyfriend and I stopped in for lunch while visiting Toronto during the Corona outbreak. The ambiance was so nice, the staff were very friendly and the food......OMG The food was absolutely delicious!!! I had the Pad Thai and my boyfriend had the curry. Both were soooo flavorful and plentiful. We had the chicken satay for an app and that too was fabulous!!!! Pai Northern Thai Kitchen will not disappoint. As I'm writing this my boyfriend is currently ordering takeout for tonight since the dining room is closed.
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen	4	2020-05-26	"I give this restaurant four stars. I have eaten food at Pai twice, most recently in late November 2019.

Pai is a trendy Thai restaurant located in downtown Toronto. It is one of the most popular spots in the city so you need to make a reservation in advance. It is busy and loud, and constantly has hip hop and pop music playing in the background. The majority of the guests are millennials so it might not be the best place for everyone.

The food is very good and very filling. I always order too much which is okay as the leftovers (excluding anything crispy) tend to travel well. There are a lot of menu options and you can't really go wrong with anything.

Highly recommended. I will be back soon. Four stars."
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen	5	2020-04-05	"Great Thai food is really hard to come by.    This place is always busy, but the wait is not too bad.  I think we waited about 30 mins, but the food was well worth it.  We got the Squash fritter, Chicken Pad Thai, Massaman Curry and some drinks.  We enjoyed everything

Would come by here again"
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen	5	2020-03-07	"Bold flavours and a electric atmosphere make Pai a go to if you're craving Thai in Toronto. The dishes are full of flavour and the pleasant heat that comes with Northern Thai food specifically. The beef curry that I had was rich without being overpowering, and the Tom Yum soup was just the right balance of sour and spicy. 

I would definitely recommend going, but be sure to either make a reservation or be prepared to wait in line for a table. I went on a random weekday night and still needed to call a few days in advance for a table for four"
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen	5	2020-03-15	"I miss their Thai food there!
The curry and Tom yum soup are always two of the dishes that I always ordered! Must try if you loveeee Thai food! :)"
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen	5	2020-03-09	"Came across this restaurant while browsing food places closeby the DoubleTree hotel. It was about a 13 min walk and my boyfriend and I came at 9pm. We were thinking the crowd would die down by then but we were wrong. The restaurant was still packed. We were able to get seated quickly. 
I ordered the pad Thai and my boyfriend ordered the pad gra prow. I can't have spicy so I ordered no spice. You have the option of adjusting the spice level. My boyfriend got medium spice for his dish. He cleaned his plate good and ended up finishing mine. Portions were good for the price. Plates range starting from $15-16. Quality and flavors were there so it was a good meal. We loved the playlist they were playing and the ambiance. It was pretty loud in there with the music playing and the crowd, but we enjoyed our meal. Servers gave us great and fast service!"
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen	5	2020-02-09	"Went on a Sunday night and there was already a line. We got a table for two within five minutes. For a Thai restaurant, I would have to say this place has an unusual ambience -- it's dimly lit with popular North American songs blasting on speakers throughout the restaurant, and can be quite loud. There is also a full bar here if that's your thing.

All in all, the food was great. The Gaeng Kiaw Wan 'In a Coconut' is a green curry dish served with rice and extra green curry in a bowl on the side (the waiter said it was because it can't all fit in the coconut). It is a dish more on the spicy side, but I would say it's still manageable. The coconut really gives this dish some character, and you can also scoop out some coconut meat with your spoon to eat as well. You can choose between chicken, beef, dish, or tofu & veggies.

Khao Soi is also a curry dish but it is a coconut curry dish. It is more sweet than spicy but still has a kick of spice to it. I like the combination of egg noodles and crunchy noodles. We got braised beef chunks (like the ones you put in beef stew), but you can choose between chicken or beef. I thought this dish might be overhyped when I was reading Yelp reviews prior to coming here, but it really is worth the hype.

Highly recommend this place for anyone looking to have Thai food in Toronto. I'll definitely be back again."
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen	5	2020-02-06	"Just went here for lunch.    Amazing food and great service.   Get here early or make sure to have a reservation, because this place gets busy (and for good reason).

Had the green curry with fish.   For $16 you get a ton of food.   Got about 5 pieces of delicious fish (Basa though, but I like the taste of Basa).   The fish is not over battered in its panko crust.    Fried to perfection and very juicy.  The curry sauce is so good which is served on the side.   I dipped the fish and poured some on my rice.   

Have to go back to try the Khao soi next time.   Can't wait to go back"
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen	4	2020-02-16	"Hip young Thai restaurant that meets or surpasses  the old school authentic Thai restaurant taste! Cool decor and atmosphere, played good music. Young waiters and waitresses. 

Accommodated us by seating us at the bar! They also had the option of traditional Thai floor seating. 

We were in a rush and opted to sit at the bar. The food was unreal!!!!!!!! 

We had a papaya salad for starters which we were hoping was spicy but literally had no spice factor at all. It was ehh...I have had better.

But the main dishes were top notch.

I ordered the Pad Gra Prow with chicken and I can not stop thinking about it. So delicious. The pad thai was also yummy. But the Pad Gra Prow was my absolute fav."
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen	5	2020-01-17	"Atmosphere: 5
Cleanliness: 5
Quality: 5
Service: 5
Taste: 5

Couldn't secure a reservation during my visit to Toronto but they take walk-ins so that's what I did. The wait for a party of 2 on the evening (the day after new year) was estimated to be about 20 minutes but we were seated before that. 

For drinks I had the regular Thai tea and then later an alcohol version of Thai tea  featuring vodka (yea, you read that right!! IT was rather tasty!)

The spring rolls and tom yum soup were  our appetizers of choice. The rolls were fried with cabbage and mushrooms inside. The soup served with mushrooms and shrimp was flavorful and well balanced.

The khao soi and pad krapow were our entrées of choice. The pad krapow came out with the fried egg and rice and tasted as it should. And khao soi was truly excellent. The curry was  possibly one the best I've tasted .

Overall, Pai lived up to my expectations and to it's name. By the time we walked out, there was a line of people waiting to be seated that went around the block it seemed and when I saw that, I nodded in agreement. Worth the wait!"
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen	4	2019-12-23	"Pai has its fair share of rave reviews, and I have to agree for the most part. I've been 4-5 times before and it's always busy. There is ALWAYS a wait if you're going to walk in. We went on a Saturday night and surprisingly only waited 15 min for a table for 2. I've had to wait for over an hour during previous visits. Pai makes you feel like you're on a street in Thailand, experiencing their vibrant street foods. Service is casual and friendly - they are always super busy so I was satisfied with the level of attention from the wait staff. 

1) squash fritters - a crispy delicious finger food, served with a sweet and sour dipping sauce. I just found the fritters a little mushy towards the middle, I wish the whole fritter was as crispy as the edges. 
2) pad Thai - excellent!! One of the best pad Thais I've had, super balanced flavours and the medium spicy was perfect for us. 
3) green curry - served in a young coconut, I did not really enjoy this. The curry was watery and the chicken was very dry. The only part I enjoyed was scraping the coconut pulp out of the shell."
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen	4	2019-12-28	"This place is definitely one of my favourite Thai restaurants in Toronto! The flavours are very authentic and I am still craving this now as I write this. Reservations are preferred, especially for a large group as this restaurant is extremely popular and crowded. The decor is very welcoming and unique, with vintage items on the walls and tables. I would recommend dining in the separate area in the back, as it is quite loud and may be too noisy for some. 

My favourite dishes are the pad gra prow (Basil Stir-Fry Beef with steamed jasmine rice) and the green curry that comes inside a coconut, which is a nice touch. I don't normally have a high spice tolerance, but the medium spice level was just right for me or it would be too bland otherwise. I also loved their Thai Iced Tea which was very rich and refreshing! Look forward to my next visit!"
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen	5	2019-12-08	"WOW!! Completely understand why this restaurant has such amazing reviews. We arrived here around 7:15pm and only waited 15 minutes before being seated. There's a designated area for those waiting for seating so customers aren't standing around the entrance. 

We ordered the spring rolls (vegetarian), Chef Nuit Pad Thai, and Khao Soi. For the dishes, you're able to select the level of spiciness as well. This was my first time trying Khao Soi at any thai restaurant and I was blown away! The broth was creamy and the dishes were all cooked and seasoned to perfection. 

Definitely one of our favorite meals in Toronto."
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen	4	2020-03-19	"It's always Pai VS Khao San Road and I am Pai fan. I like their curries better and their pad thai is saucier and more flavourful than Khao San Road.

I would say that the line ups are ridiculous here considering how many years this place has been opened for so go early or go have a drink while you're waiting."
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen	3	2020-03-16	"I'm really not sure why this place has such great reviews, I found the food merely average. The interior reminds me more of the Southeast Asia budget ""backpacker"" vibe, ie partiers. It's certainly a part of the Thai experience but not really my thing.

Tom yum soup - this was pretty solid with vibrant flavors and a good kick. Maybe I've really lost spice tolerance but I was starting to drip before I was done with the cup...

Pad cha hett - mushroom stir fry. I got this with black rice just to try something new and it didn't quite fit the rest of the dish. If you get this, stick with the jasmine. The stir fry part was disappointingly bland though. It had a bit of a fennel taste to it, not sure what that comes from."
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen	5	2020-03-08	THIS PLACE WAS SOOOOO GOOD! I was in Toronto for a women's conference and my friend and I decided to check this place out for dinner. We were promptly seated and given menus. She's a vegetarian and they had really nice options to choose from. I went with the pad Thai. We got our food and holy portions! I ate mine for dinner, a later meal before bed, then STILL had some left for the next day. My friend got the soup and also got 2 meals out of it. Service was great, location was great and priced very reasonable for downtown Toronto!
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen	4	2019-12-28	"Food: A very popular place in downtown for thai food and it definitely did not disappoint me at all! I did not order pad thai (what I usually stick with) because I was trying to be more adventurous and I was very glad with my food choices! I highly recommend the pork rice with egg as it was the best out of three. Im guessing the pork was marinated with a lot of different ingredients and so with the fish sauce and lime juices, there was a burst of different flavours going on in a single bite. The chicken wings were amazing as well but nothing too surprising. The curry noodle was very interesting as I did not expect them to use egg noodle, the beef brisket was too hard though. I did still enjoy the coconut heavy flavoured curry overall. 

Portion: Normal to small

Environment: I was put to sit at a high table and the only issue was that there was no where to hang my winter jacket. Other than that the vibe of the restaurant was really nice with all the decors!"
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen	4	2019-11-27	"Came here on a Monday at lunch and it was really busy. I love the cool, hipster vibe of this place, it feels very casual, has really cool decor, theres a bar and overall it just feels comfortable.
We ordered the Papaya Salad which I really liked. The papaya is soaked in tamarind sauce giving it a sweet & sour taste, it came with flavourful shrimp chips, crispy pork grinds, some noodles and cabbage. Everything eaten together tastes so good! Definitely recommend!
I had the Masaman Beef Curry, at first the bowl looks kind of small but its actually very filling. They give you a lot of beef (perfect for meat lovers) and its very tender. The curry tastes like regular curry but with a hint of sweet&sour tamarind which I really liked.
My friend had the Khao Soi and to me it was just ok, it tastes like a regular coconut curry. Reminds me of a Malaysian Laksa."
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen	3	2020-02-21	"It was alright. Went in here for lunch service and ordered the Khao soi.  I knew all the hype surrounding this restaurant. 

To be honest I don't understand why they are awarded with such accolades I stayed in Thailand for a month so I will use that for comparison. 

I find the Khao soi too rich and coconutty. It over takes the subtle nuances of a balanced dish. It just taste like coconut cream soup. I wouldn't make this the quintessential place for Thai food. Support other local businesses."
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos	5	2020-04-22	"I never fully understood the taco genre but my life changed when I had the Baja fish taco. Best taco I've ever had in my life. I think of it often. 

I also had the Pulpo a la Mexicana (octopus), which was also good but I definitely don't love eating octopus in a taco. Biting into a taco with crispy fish is just more satisfying than something chewy, y'know?

A warning to those who are visiting for the first time, there is almost no sitting room in this place so be prepared to bring your tacos elsewhere to eat.

Love this place."
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos	1	2020-05-24	"Ok, so I know this place is all the rage. 

I ordered the grilled beef for corona takeaway and I was disgusted. There was more fat, cartilage and inedible pieces than beef. Chew chew CRUNCH - spit. Over and over. My friend called me two hours later after ordering the same thing - she ended up giving her order to the homeless after the first bite. 

This means that they either don't clean (cut the meat) properly, or using cheaper pieces to save a buck. 

The grilled chicken was dry too. Honestly though, the shrimp was good. Stick to pulled beef and chicken for authenticity and - TEXTURE. C'mon seven lives!

Very disappointed."
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos	3	2020-04-20	"This place is a small hole in the wall and worth visiting if you crave some good old fashioned tacos rather than the commercial stuff.. portion sizes were good however the flavours were slightly missing for me.. 

I would visit them again if I was in the area, but not necessarily my go to place. Please don't let my review deter you from trying their tacos though, they are still pretty good. 

Flavours can be very subjective and this place is definitely worth a try.. but if you know and love tacos and taco culture as much as me, then you would also know that everyone has their own go to spot.. 

This place has great service, friendly staff and a small seating area if you just want to eat quickly or grab'n'go."
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos	4	2020-02-16	"CASH ONLY!!! & the location is kind of odd and the place is super tiny! But through it all the tacos are delicious....

All tacos are 6 bucks each. 

I ordered 2 tacos and was super full! I got the smoked marlin taco and the camarones a la diabla.

The camarones a la diabla was so fire!!! All the flavors were perfect. The marlin taco was not bad but a little on the drier side. Def would recommend the camarones a la diabla!

I tried the HOT salsa - and I like spicy but this was reallllly spicy! Good flavor tho but just an FYI for those daring souls.

I did not like that they didn't have small cups for salsa and you had to put your salsa straight on your taco. It's some what unsanitary from my perspective."
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos	4	2020-01-21	"Came here before during my visit in Toronto and really enjoyed this place. There isn't much room to sit or eat, but they give you sauces and likes for your tacos. 
Food -
Cabeza : very tender meat and lots of sauce. Would definitely get it again.
The fish taco I had here was very good as well. 
The prices here are a little much but the quality of the food makes up for it. Definitely worth coming for a bite."
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos	4	2020-01-30	"Knowing where to get the best tacos in town is serious business. As it stands, the best tacos that I have ever eaten have been at Tacofino in Tofino and Tres Carnales Taquería in Edmonton. After reading that Seven Lives was voted #1 Best Taco 2018 by NOW Toronto, named in National Geographic magazine's Places of a Lifetime article, and called #1 Best Fish Taco and #1 Best Tacos by blogTO... They seemed like a sure bet.

You'll find Seven Lives located in Kensington Market, one of the most eclectic corners of the city which suits them well. I visited the tiny shop on a Friday evening, prior to their early closing time of 7pm. They're definitely more of a lunch or early dinner type of place. It should also be noted that they accept cash only, so come prepared!

The tiny shop is bustling and exciting, buzzing with taco energy. The bright walls and giant sign that reads ""TACOS"" sets the vibe perfectly. I also appreciate their logo of a cat with a fish in its mouth - and the insinuation that this cat is down to seven lives, having already lost two. There is one table that can seat about four people and then there's a little bit of standing-room-only counter space. This makes things a little bit awkward if you plan to eat-in, as I did. The table wasn't available and so I stood at the counter in front of the window to eat instead. Which was fine. But certainly not ideal.

The menu is fairly straight forward, including nine types of tacos, some sides, and some beverages. Your order is placed at the counter with a friendly staff member and they call out your name once the food is ready.

Starting with something to drink, I was happy to see Agua de Jamaica on the menu. I always prefer an agua fresca when visiting a Mexican establishment, although I was also happy to see that Jarritos Mexican sodas are also on offer. (Their cola is my personal favourite of all of the colas.) Agua de Jamaica, otherwise known as ""hibiscus water"" is a beverage that exists in several cultures. In Southeast Asia it is known as Rosella tea and it's basically the same thing. Tart and sweet, this refreshing drink was a perfect accompaniment to the food.

We decided to get a Side as a bit of an appetizer. Tortilla Chips (Made fresh! - $3.00) and Guacamole ($3.00 for small) seemed like the way to go. I was a bit surprised that the guacamole didn't just come with tortilla chips and that both items had to be purchased separately. However, I did enjoy the homemade nature of the chips and that a heaping amount of them are tossed into a brown paper bag and given to you. I'll take a bag of chips any day. Golden and ultra crispy, these tortilla chips are exactly what I wanted them to be. They were seasoned really nicely as well. The guacamole was fresh and bright, with a great acidic kick to it. Obviously chips and guac are a match made in heaven.

Next it was time for the big show: the TACOS. Of the nine tacos available, two of them (the Adobada and the Carnitas) were already sold out. On the plus side, I probably wouldn't have ordered either of these anyway. Although, I must say that this did not leave much for meat options. There were four fish/seafood tacos, one beef and one chicken option, and a vegetarian. Nothing for pork at all. But again, I did not mind at all because I was going full ocean food - it's what they specialize in, after all.

Baja Fish ($6.00) and Gobernador ($6.00) were the ones for me. I loved the little condiments bar to the left of the counter that featured three different salsas (hot habanero, medium tomatillo, mild guajillo) as well as chili oil with sesame, and a bowl of sliced limes. This makes it very easy to customize your tacos to your preferred specifications and to control the amount of heat that you desire.

The tacos did not take very long and before I knew it, a green plastic basket was placed in my hands. The tacos were certainly vibrant and demanding to be eaten.

I began with the Gobernador (smoked marlin, shrimp & cheese). If Seven Lives has a signature taco, this is the one. Their front window even says ""home of the Gobernador"" right on it. I definitely loved the smokiness from the marlin the most, while the shrimp filled out the taco and added more texture. Everything had been grilled up deliciously. The pickled onion brought a great hit of balancing flavour and I liked the fresh tortillas a lot.

Next I had the Baja Fish (fried haddock). The first thing that I noticed is how generous the portion of fish is! The haddock was big, juicy and fried to perfection. The rest of the taco was kept very fresh with cabbage and fresh homemade salsa on top.

Both tacos were packed full and were pretty messy to eat, but in the best possible way. I liked both tacos but found them to be missing something that I can't quite put my finger on. I guess that I was hoping for something even bigger and more unexpected in terms of flavour. They were good... Just not the best that I've ever had.

I was also very impressed to see a C"
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos	4	2019-12-08	"We were extremely excited to try this taco spot during our stay in Toronto. Unfortunately, everything was sold out when we arrived the first day. Lucky for us, we were there for the first ""Pedestrian Sunday"" of the year. The street is closed off and many restaurants bring their business on the streets with stands. 

The tacos were a lot bigger than I imagined! They're a little on the pricier side but so worth it. They also have four sauces on the side with different spice levels - mild, medium, hot and Mexican hot. 

Cash only spot, please come prepared!"
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos	5	2019-11-25	"Wow, the most intense tacos I've ever had! Don't go expecting to have a sit down meal and please do yourself a favour and don't go on a date here because you will get messy. I promise you it's all worth it.

Wait in line and order at the cash, wait for your tacos and hope there's a seat. We were there at 3pm on a Saturday and we managed to squeeze in at the bar table. You can always take out but I think dining there is also part of the experience. 

The tacos are massive! I thought 2 wouldn't be enough but it was more than enough. They also have many different hot sauces you can add. Never have I eaten tacos with a fork but trust me, these are very big and I had to eat half the inside before I was able to somewhat grab them.

I believe they're opening a larger location across the street, I think it's much needed to keep up with the demand!"
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos	5	2019-10-24	"My cousin loves this taco place and highly recommended us to come here for our 2nd food adventure. We ordered the octopus taco and the grilled swordfish taco. Each taco was able $6ish, which is really pricey for a taco. I am used to getting tacos for $3-4ish in San Francisco, so these $6ish tacos better be delicious.

Octopus taco (5/5) - For any octopus lovers here, I highly recommend this taco. I've never had octopus tacos before and this was super delicious. You know that the octopus is fresh when you see an employee pulling the octopus with a large strainer out of a bucket. 

Grilled swordfish taco (5/5) - I don't eat swordfish often, but when I took a bite of this taco, I thought the fish tasted like meat. This was pretty good too.

This shop is really small. They provide different levels of hot sauce on the counter, along with some wet wipes. This place is CASH ONLY, so make sure to bring enough cash. The tacos are on the pricier end, but definitely worth it!"
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos	4	2019-12-07	"I always had this place tucked away in my Yelp bookmarks but never made it until now. I dropped by with a friend for a snack after Christmas Market and it definitely lived up to it's wonderful reviews!

The restaurant is in the heart of Kensington Market and is pretty small. Only one table that fits about 6 and a bar area where you could stand. I got Gobernador and it was SO GOOD. I feel like this was also enhanced by the fact that we were starving since we are directionally challenged and spent about 15 minutes getting lost before finding the place ...

They were very generous with the toppings, lots of cheese, shrimp, and marlin. Everything was enveloped by two taco shells the outer one was crispier and the inner was soft providing a nice contrast."
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos	5	2019-11-24	"When I tell you I have truly nothing bad to say about this place I truly mean it . This place is one of my favorite tacos and yes it's all the way in Canada !! These tacos taste so authentic, fresh and are made to order. We also got chips and salsa which was were tasty as well ! 
I tried the shrimp, carnitas and carne asada !! Believe it or not my favorite was the shrimp !! The sauce was incredible! Definitely a little messy but honestly just grab some chips and pick up what was left behind.
Loved this place !!"
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos	5	2019-11-23	"Special tacos are $6, which is more expensive than I am used to spending on tacos but you are also paying for unique, higher quality tacos. We had the Baja Fish and Carnitas tacos and they were delicious. Definitely a must-try place in Toronto.

Like many places in Kensington, the place is quite small and there aren't many seats. Be prepared to either stand at their standing tables or stand outside and eat. We stood at one of the standing tables which was fine because it doesn't take long to consume their delicious tacos."
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos	4	2019-09-21	"Visit: Saturday inthe 5 o'clock hour 

Atmosphere: small shop,minimal seating only one uneven bench and only uneven table lol busy but organized line moves at a decent pace 

Food: I got 2 tacos $6 each, all tacos are the same price. I got the fried haddock and the beef... the beef was so tender and literally melted in my mouth the sauce that they but on it paired well with it. The haddock wow what a large portion the fillet was bigger than my tortilla that never happens the tartar sauce was yummy and went great with the diced tomatoes. Both tacos were hot temperature wise and served fresh

I would recommend and I will go back next time I'm in the area to try the other combinations"
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos	4	2019-09-22	"Pros:
1. The shrimp & cheese taco (only 1 taco...) is delicious.
2. The taco finishes with a layer of cheese and pickled onion, quite guilty :) 
3. And a layer of meat at the bottom!

Cons:
1.long lineup 
2. $2 higher than other places in Kensington Market."
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos	5	2019-09-15	"All you want in a tacos street style stop! 

Small place, too crowded, mexican deco a bit modernized, not much place to eat....


But but but.  The best tacos i had in my life! 

Try the cabeza really amazing and a bit spicy
the carnita more classic but really good
And the pulpo a la mexicans was also amazing. 

A must stop in visiting Toronto"
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos	4	2019-09-25	"4 stars for taste
2 stars for price 
Which really should be a 3, but the meat is just so delicious. Coming from LA, I just don't think I can justify 6 CAD for ONE taco and one alone!! If you expect to be full, get ready to spend 20 CAD per person (and really that's like 3 tacos plus tax). 

With price aside, the taste is absolutely delicious. I tried the Pollo Asado and Carnitas- the chicken taco was so tender and the dressing was creamy, dressed with carrots. The carnitas was more no frills - meat with a salsa. 

There's a salsa bar on the side and limited seating, one bench table and the rest is counter space along the window."
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos	5	2019-09-01	"They have never let me down. Their tacos has consistently been the best I've had in Toronto. Always fresh, always delicious. I always bring visitors to this joint because it's such a good reflection of the food, culture, environment of Toronto. 

Tried their beef cheeks for the first time and my goodness, I don't know why it took me so long! It was absolutely heavenly. Definitely recommend!"
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos	5	2019-08-18	"I expected to experience a lot of exceptional food while in Toronto for a few days, but being from Southern California I most certainly did not expect to have one of the best contemporary tacos of my life. That's exactly what happened, and everything I thought I knew about Seafood tacos has been shaken. 

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?

Seven Lives is a somewhat cramped little shop that's cash only and is prone to both overheating and overcrowding in the Summer. Typically, that's a recipe for disaster as far as service and atmosphere are concerned, but the chaos builds on the hype a bit to be honest and it's all good in my mind given Seven Lives actually delivers on their widespread and now long-standing hype. Hunker down, have your cash ready, and you can expect your tacos in between ten and fifteen minutes after ordering. Until then just sit back and watch them work their magic. Star. 

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

$6.00 per taco is expensive, plain and simple even with a generous rate of exchange to the USD these days. Even so, the tacos at Seven Lives are at least two to even three times larger than your standard street taco and are jam packed with all sorts of different fillings, which makes the price point worth it. Star. 

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

For the purposes of emphasis, I'm going to set aside what was an exceptional Spicy Chicken taco in its own right just to focus in on the real prize here, which is and was the Gobernador taco. 

Smoked Marlin, Shrimp, Cheese, spices, house made fiery habanero sauce. This was so unexpected, so exceptional, so life-changing that I didn't even know what to do with myself. This was, I think it's fair to say, the very best seafood taco I've ever had in my entire life, and that's after having visited at least fifty or so seafood taco spots across the United States. Amazing. Two Stars. 

Star 5: Would you be excited to go back?

High Praise for Seven Lives. I read in an interview that at one point the chef had deliberated between opening a shop in Toronto versus Southern California - my vote goes to both. Star."
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos	5	2019-07-23	"These tacosssss. Hello. Still dreaming about them.

Is this a teeny tiny place? Yes. Is it extremely hot and muggy in here? Yes. Will you wait for a ridiculous amount of time in a lineup outside? Yes. BUT IT'S WORTH IT. Look, I'll wait all day for a good taco. I don't even care.

I tried the carnitas taco and the beef taco. Both were phenomenal and I'm just gonna make a bold statement - these were some of the best tacos I've ever had. The beef taco in particular was a stand out. The meat was so tender that it practically melted in my mouth, and the flavors were an absolute explosion of deliciousness. I love how they pile fresh cilantro on these babies. There's also a supplemental sauce station (in addition to what's already on the taco when it's handed to you), but I just went for a squeeze of fresh lime and that was all I needed.

Be aware that Seven Lives is cash only, but there's an ATM right across the street, so no worries there. Prepare to be amazed. This place is the one. Hallelujah, praise be to the taco gods."
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos	5	2019-09-06	"My friend recommended this place. I was a bit skeptical at first, since I just went to San Diego not long ago and ate a lot of good tacos. I gave it a shot when my boyfriend and I passed by Kensington market. Although a bit iffy at the $6 price, we decided the line was a good indicator that the tacos were good.

This place is cash only, and we waited in line for 20 minutes or so. The line moves fairly quickly. We got the fish taco and one of the shrimp tacos - the fish taco was definitely the best I've had. The shrimp one was also good, but not as good as the fish taco.

Really wish we ordered more!"
KINKA IZAKAYA ORIGINAL	5	2020-05-14	"I would share this, but I'm too shellfish 
.
CHEEEESY baked oysters with spinach, mushrooms, and garlic mayo   
5/5
Incredibly delicious  I can rarely order this dish from Kinka Izakaya because THEY ALWAYS RUN OUT! Located at the heart of Toronto, this authentic Japanese restaurant is super fun, loud, and welcoming! It's the perfect spot to let loose and chill with friends! oishiiiii~

Take advantage of the 30% off promo they have on all takeout orders and order now!"
KINKA IZAKAYA ORIGINAL	5	2020-05-04	"Absolutely loved this spot when I went with friends on vacation in Toronto. I love Japanese izakaya spots because it's always fun to share the dishes and it's usually a lot of unique tapas. The menu has a nice variety to choose from, including the drinks. This is a long overdue review so I don't remember all the things we got. However, I do remember we got the fried shrimp, karaage, pressed salmon sushi, yaki udon, kalbi and more. They were all packed with flavor and very delicious! The portions can be a little small for its price but the experience and how the food actually tasted made up for it. For 4 people, we split about 8 dishes. We were decently full but could have ordered more.  

The atmosphere inside is so lively! For birthdays, they take a free polaroid for your party! I thought that was so cute. There were a lot of parties doing sake bombs as well. Whenever I'm back in Toronto, I'd definitely hit up this spot again. I highly recommend!"
KINKA IZAKAYA ORIGINAL	5	2020-05-04	"My friend got the lunch set which includes a don, salad, some takoyaki and kaarage, sashimi, and miso soup. I believe it was around $18 which is an amazing deal for the amount of variety you get! 

I got the kaarage don, which I have raved about so many times before. Kinka consistently serves fresh food that is full of flavour at an amazing price. It's my favourite izakaya and I will continue to go here again and again!"
KINKA IZAKAYA ORIGINAL	3	2020-03-12	"One of the oldest restaurants that I had been to. Since North York. It's always been a great experience with them! No matter was the lunch hours having great lunch sets and yummy fish; but also the dinner are always pretty impressive. The late snacks are pretty good too! 
Don't forget to try their cocktails if you drink! 
Overall a pretty good experience there although sometimes is too noisy to talk with frds"
KINKA IZAKAYA ORIGINAL	5	2020-05-25	"I've spent multiple birthdays here & the atmosphere is absolutely fantastic! 
The entire staff Cheers & greets you when you come in, the vibe is awesome and so is the food!"
KINKA IZAKAYA ORIGINAL	5	2019-12-30	"I love this restaurant! The atmosphere is lively, the staff are friendly, the food is fresh and delicious!

I've been here a few times now with varying groups of friends. I have to say, all have found it to be a very pleasant experience.

By this point, I've pretty much ordered everything on the menu at least once. The menu does not have a grand selection, and the portions are more less Japanese tapa-style. Great to share. You really can't go wrong with anything, but I particularly liked the udon (I know.. of all things, it's actually the best udon I've had in a while!). Of course, you also HAVE to (like MUST!!) order the sake bombs. When the sake bombs come, the restaurant chants with you and you pound your hands on the table until the shot drops into the beer cup. You then chug it (it's easy to go down, no worries).

Honestly such a fun experience. A great place to go with friends!"
KINKA IZAKAYA ORIGINAL	3	2019-11-04	"Heard a lot of hype about Kinka from friends who've been here previously and I wanted to love it but the volume level and food ultimately is what makes me give this place 3 stars. 

It's ABSURDLY loud, can't hear the person next to you talking; get ready to scream your order out. Most of the food was fine to not good but some of the things that I did find pretty delicious was the buta kakuni, miso black cod (albeit way too bones), and the yaki udon.

The karrage had too much batter and was hella dry, salmon oshizushi was bland, takoyaki and okonomiyaki was really w/e.

Basically I've had the same dishes better and at a reasonable volume at other places. Kinka is ultimately a turn up spot and if you treat it as such you won't be disappointed."
KINKA IZAKAYA ORIGINAL	3	2020-02-08	"For a party of 3, we ordered 3 set meals and 2 drinks, and we left with our stomachs pretty full. This is my 3rd time at this location, but unfortunately stars were docked off for quite an uncomfortable experience. 

Made a reservation for a party of 3 for 6:30pm on a Tuesday, what we were given was a small table for 2 with a small stool at the side of our table, with my back to the adjacent customers table at a corner, which essentially felt like I was in the middle of the walkway. Throughout the entire dinner, I had felt extremely awkward and uncomfortable as I had felt the waiters/waitresses' bodies touching mine every time they came by to serve food to the table behind me. We've requested 2 times, when the restaurant was not packed for a larger table, but nothing was to be done. Unsurprisingly, I felt like we were being rushed in finishing our plates one right after the other as there were no room at all to fit any dishes anymore. 

If we had proper seating and space, I believe the experience would have been that much greater."
KINKA IZAKAYA ORIGINAL	5	2019-08-28	"The gyudon set was great! Has everything we need. $18 for 6 different types of small dishes but overall it's totally enough. The gyudon was sooooo good. 

The staff are very energetic and the service was great. The restaurant became crowded after 12:15pm. (We came around 11:50am and there was no one). If you wanna avoid the rush on weekdays, better come before 12pm."
KINKA IZAKAYA ORIGINAL	5	2020-01-19	Such an amazing place! Everything on the food menu is  good. There is no bad item on it. My favourite is the pumpkin croquette. The items are small portions good to split about 2 people per plate, so it gives you a chance to try a variety of dishes. The servers are very nice and I love that they all greet you when you enter/exit. Food comes out very fast and prices are good. Always a good place to go.
KINKA IZAKAYA ORIGINAL	5	2019-07-22	"My family and I came here with a party of 20 to celebrate our cousins bday. We left extremely full and a lil tipsy. This is your authentic izakaya with traditional seating , plenty of skewers and an extensive beverage menu. Most of our table decided to opt for the more expensive set menu. We love the beef carpaccio, kinoko bibimbap and the grilled miso black cod were a must try. Flavors were definitely very filling and packed with plenty of flavor. Texture wise the set menu is a great sampler to try all of their signature dishes. 
The samurai sake bombs are a must order if you want your bang for your buck for just 1 bomb. Save room for dessert as well as the black sesame or matcha ice cream are a must order. Overall we really enjoyed our experience and the food was superb. We had many picky eaters in the party but Kinka was able to accommodate all is!"
KINKA IZAKAYA ORIGINAL	5	2020-05-10	Service is always awesome even when they have a full house. The variety in dishes is also top notch. Not so close to my office, unfortunately.
KINKA IZAKAYA ORIGINAL	4	2019-07-11	"I've been here multiple times and always had a great time. This time, we decided to sit outside. Their seating for two people is very small and you don't have much space between the tables beside yours so it can feel a little cramped. 

This time, we decided to try their Kinkcalious which consists of eight small courses. The food was really good and I'm glad the baked oysters were one of the dishes because that's my favorite dish here! The rapini veggies tasted a bit weird to me but overall the dishes were good. Service was a bit slow outside in their patio and the waiters don't really pay a lot of attention to the diners because there were a lot of times where I tried to call out to them or get their attention and they just weren't looking in my direction. Overall, good food and okay service."
KINKA IZAKAYA ORIGINAL	4	2020-02-28	"THE FOOD IS VERY GOOD!
The experience that I had there was amazing. As a Japanese, I always miss Japanese food and the atmosphere of Japanese izakaya. This place gave me a flash-back of my memories of Japan. The food that you can get there is indeed very authentic. The atmosphere was also like real-Japanese izakaya-style where the servers are very energetic and cheering. The communication can be a little bit hard since they are real Japanese whose English isn't the best, but it wouldn't bother you. Overall, this place offers you a good izakaya experience! As expected, the price isn't low, however, I could understand based on their food and service. If you really want to enjoy the great atmosphere of a Japanese izakaya, this place may be a good place to try!"
KINKA IZAKAYA ORIGINAL	4	2020-01-19	This izakaya place is very popular, so I highly recommend to make reservation in advance. The food were good. The portion was small, so it is a good way to try various dishes. But I definitely enjoyed the drinks more. I personally prefer fruity drinks, and there were a lot of options. The restaurant also had special cocktail menu, and I LOVED the Yuzu Mitsu High one. The prices were reasonable, and the service was good. The only thing I didn't enjoy much was that the restaurant was really loud, and it was hard to chat with the friends. But overall I still had a good time!
KINKA IZAKAYA ORIGINAL	4	2019-07-14	"Kinka Izakaya has a set menu Kinkalicious during Summerlicious!
It has 8 courses and serves 2(need 2 people to order). It's actually quite filling and is a great way to try many of their best dishes! Beef yukke is probably my favorite!

It's super loud in the restaurant which is a great Japanese izakaya experience. But probably not for people who are planning to have a quiet time there."
KINKA IZAKAYA ORIGINAL	4	2019-06-16	"Wow! So many awesome surprises, from the garlic chips on the salad to the marinated octopus wasabi! Everything was fresh and innovative. We got the salmon tataki, sashimi salad, gomaae (rapini with black sesame seed) and tako wasabi. The rapini was awesome and tasted like nasu dengaku, even though rapini doesn't taste like eggplant, obv. They provided nori strips to make your own sushi rolls with whatever you've ordered, which is perfect for me because I like to put the veggies into sushi, but don't eat rice. The only thing I would not do is order seared fish to go because it doesn't arrive fast enough to be fresh. Get sashimi not seared for takeaway. 

I was happy with salad and rapini, while my friend was happy with the sashimi. I made a marinade of coconut vinegar, habanero sauce, garlic and coconut aminos for the sashimi as it was seared, it was starting to smell like fish. 

They provided soy sauce and wasabi mayo. 

This was a really fresh and new treat for tavern style Japanese! I was so excited I started eating with the wrong end of the chopsticks."
KINKA IZAKAYA ORIGINAL	5	2019-11-03	"Not from the area but absolutely enjoyed my lunch here! I wish I was able to visit again to try the dinner tapas portion. 

Lunch options weren't a lot, but my lunch set tasted so good! Also the place radiates terrace house vibes..."
KINKA IZAKAYA ORIGINAL	5	2019-05-16	"I decided to try this japanese spot when visiting Toronto on a Thursday evening, and was surprised to find it quite lively and packed at 10pm. The servers were shouting some crazy stuff when serving certain dishes, and it all felt very lively. If your looking for a quiet place to eat, this definitely is not the spot, but I liked it. The service wasn't very quick, but the enjoyment made up for it. 

I ordered the Salmon Foil Yaki ($13) and Pork Steak ($9). The salmon came with grilled onions and mushrooms in a nice soy sauce mixture, and the fish was cooked very well. Each bite was juicy and it was soft to cut but still held firm together. The pork steak was my favorite though as it was a fatty flavory cut of pork with a sudbtle mustard sauce with some rice crisps, green onions, and lettuce on the side.

I couldn't help but smile when eating at this place. The food was very delicious, and cooked very well. I am usually not impressed with japanese style late night drinking/food spots (Izakaya), but this has been my favorite, and I've been to quite a few in Vancouver. Would be happy to bring a crew of people here again."
KINKA IZAKAYA ORIGINAL	5	2019-03-31	"As soon as you walk in, you're greeted loudly by all the staff shouting ""irasshaimase!"" (welcome in Japanese) The seating is large tables that you share or seats along the bar. The music is loud and people are loud, but that's expected of an izakaya/bar and it was pretty fun to watch people downing sake bombs. The music selection was also awesome! Even asked for the playlist afterwards :)

Ok moving onto the food. The food was SO GOOD! I'm definitely a meat lover over a veggie lover , but the vegetable appetizer I ordered was delicious. It had a deep, smoky flavor and was seasoned well. Same goes for the yaki udon. The mackerel sushi was lightly blow torched and didn't have a fishy taste. The desserts were also excellent. I HIGHLY recommend the black sesame ice cream for those that like that flavor. Tasted like straight up frozen black sesame seeds (in the best way possible). I had a great time here and would go again if I'm visiting Toronto! Great food, atmosphere, and service."
Banh Mi Boys	5	2020-05-05	Yum yum. They are open during covid times. Pork belly bao.... allll the way!!!!!!! Tastes the same every time so the consistency is there. Service is very casual and run by a young group of people, don't expect smiley hellos how are yous, just walk up to the counter and say what you want lol. Their papaya salad is like the pickled carrot and radish but with an extra veg (papaya) and some dressing- it was good! Crunchy and sauce was sweet but tangy. Tried sweet potato fries for the first time and no complaints - crispy, hot. They don't have spicy mayo but will give you mayo and sriracha on the side to mix yourself. Considering they use two small containers for mayo and sriracha, why don't they just combine it in a big batch, then upcharge $1 for spicy mayo? It's easier for staff to do in big batches and have them pre-filled in containers, than for the customers who have to open both sauces up, ask for a spoon, mix it up in the container, then throw out the extra container! Nobody wants to do that while their fries are getting colder by the second! So why not offer it on their menu? It's a staple sauce for sweet potato fries and it would be a great sauce option for all baos and sandwiches. Just a thought, management! Love everything about your concept and would love to have you guys in Mississauga. [franchise? ;)]
Banh Mi Boys	5	2020-05-05	"I've been coming here for years and the food never disappoints. I really enjoy their grilled pork banh mi. I normally ask for less carrots and cucumbers because they stack it well lol.

The sauce is really tasty, the produce used is very fresh and the meat is cooked well. 

I just went today and continuously, the staff are friendly and the service is fast. The quality of their food has not changed since opening up other locations which is always a plus.

Definitely worth a visit!"
Banh Mi Boys	5	2020-03-19	"you have to try kalbi beef, either taco or sandwich or maybe bao (haven't try this yet) it is really good. 
Kimchi poutine is also very very good. 
I feel the sandwich bun is a little bit hard for me, but it's is Vietnamese style  for sure. 
Steam bao is also a good option, very soft bun. 
over all, definitely will  go back whenever i have time and chances."
Banh Mi Boys	1	2020-03-10	"I really want to like this place. I really do. I've gone here since 2013, and then I tell myself never again, but it's so close and convenient, etc. But yeah, everytime I go I wonder why it's rated so high by everyone else.

First, banh mi shouldn't take forever to make. Go to any Vietnamese place and the person behind the counter will literally slap together a sandwich in a matter of minutes. They have a team of people working here and it still takes longer somehow.

Second, the banh mi itself (i.e., the bread) doesn't taste right. It's not crunchy on the outside, soft in the middle. As for the rest of the sandwich, there's something about it that lacks authenticity. Atop of this, it's way pricier than it should be."
Banh Mi Boys	4	2020-02-07	"We had a quick bite at Banh Mi Boys as it was conveniently located near our hotel.  The menu is a decent size, and you purchase the Banh Mi sandwiches separate from the sides.  The prices are okay for the portion, however it would be nice if the sandwiches came with a little more of the vegetable slaw toppings, as the bun to topping ratio was a little much.  Our sandwiches came out quickly and were warm.  

We tried one each; I went with the Spicy Pork Belly Banh Mi, and my significant other chose the Squid.  My sandwich was really good; the flavors were fresh and delicious.  I went with the medium spicy, which was a spicy sauce.  It was just enough spice for me.  I would have liked to see more of the slaw/toppings on the sandwich.  My significant other's Squid Banh Mi was also very good, and he went with the spicy option of adding jalapenos.  He also wished for a little more of the toppings.   

Banh Mi Boys was good for a quick counter service option to dine in or take out.  My only issue was probably the cleanliness of the place; there was food on the floors and crumbs on the tables, and the garbage was overflowing.  The kitchen looked clean and our food was good, but with the lack of cleanliness in the dining area, it was hard not to feel a little put off."
Banh Mi Boys	5	2020-05-10	Great Vietnamese sandwich place. It's not that unhealthy like usual fast food and it's really delicious as well. Got a couple sandwiches when I last visited and both were perfect.
Banh Mi Boys	4	2020-04-28	I always like to drop by Banh Mi Boys when I am in the mood for some cheap eats! My go-to is the Kimchi Fries, which is like the Asian fusion version of the poutine. It's filling and great for under $10, especially if you feel like something from Smoke's would be too heavy for you.
Banh Mi Boys	5	2019-08-21	"Wowww this spot has some GOOD banh mi sandwiches.

Stopped by right after they opened on a Sunday and there were already people eating. Small spot designed mostly for take out, but there is some seating. Our group each bought a bahn mi and some sides, including fries and some boas 
I like traditional/standard banh mi sandwiches. Banh mi boys goes well beyond traditional and had some very interesting options, including the kabli beef which I got. It combined the traditional ingredients of a banh mi with Korean style beef... delicious. The sandwiches are quite large so don't feel like you need a lot of sides, or maybe share a sandwich and some sides.
We also spit some kimchi fries, which are truly LOADED, with fries, poutine, kimchi, bbq style meat and more. The portion is massive. They are delicious and loaded with tons of ingredients."
Banh Mi Boys	4	2020-02-11	"Can't belive I haven't rated the original Banh Mi Boys.. its so good! Lots of fresh fun things like Banh Mis, Kimchi Fries and Baos. Last time I was here we had to order everything. So much food! 

Real taste of Toronto/ LA"
Banh Mi Boys	5	2019-05-19	"I came here under the recommendation of a friend. I was honestly so hungry but for a decent price, I got an appetizer (kimchi fries) that were shared between three people, and a delicious fried chicken Bao, that filled me right up. 

The service was great and the wait time wasn't bad. There are tables so you can sit and chat while you eat your food.

Highly recommend! I will be back again!"
Banh Mi Boys	5	2019-12-12	"AMAZING Vietnamese Sandwiches!!!!
AMAZING Vietnamese Sandwiches!!!

This stop was pre-planned for our trip to Toronto based on the awesome reviews and I wanted to have different cuisines while in town. When we arrived in Toronto, this was our first stop for a quick bite. but I was lucky that the parking we found was walking distance to the GEM!. 

It's a boutique restaurant franchise with limited seating and people tend to order, sit and eat if there's available seats and then leave. We were lucky to get seats as it was a busy Friday afternoon. 

I could tell my sisters were skeptical about the cuisine based on their facial expressions cause they never had this before. We ended up ordering a 5 spice pork belly, grilled chicken sandwiches, a grilled chicken Taco and fried chicken Bao. Everything was delicious from there reaction.
They were really impressed by taste and crunchiness of pickled toppings paired with the sauce. The pickled carrots and cucumbers really enhanced the flavor in these sandwiches. All I heard after that was ""hmmmmm this is good"
Banh Mi Boys	3	2020-02-20	Not authentic!! It's a good sandwich with good fillings. The bread however, is what makes a Banh mi a Banh mi and it was too soggy. Really good Banh mi bread is just perfect crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. This is not it. The fries were okay as well. Also too soggy. Sigh.
Banh Mi Boys	4	2019-10-03	"Solid. I always get the grilled pork banh mi, and am always happy with my choice.

There are 3 levels of heat to choose from - sriracha, jalapeño, habañero. Having gone the jalapeño route a few times and finding there wasn't enough heat, I got the habañero and found there was way too much. You never know what a batch of peppers is going to be like on a given day, which keeps things exciting. Now I go for ""extra"" jalapeño... which is often just the perfect amount of too much.

If it's sunny out, my banh mi boy and me like to order in, but take our order out to a nearby park to eat. The meat is warm, the sandwich well constructed and well wrapped (a cute little elastic band holds it all together)... and the fresh, grilled bun makes it all come together. Orders come up pretty fast here, and the price cannot be beat. I wish there was a location in Queen West."
Banh Mi Boys	5	2020-02-11	"Probably some of the most tasty food we had all weekend!! We walked about 6 miles to go to a comic book shop and decided we needed a snack. We ordered a 5 spice pork belly bao and a squid taco and headed back to our hotel. I noticed right away my bag was pretty heavy for only having two items and the smell coming from the bag was heavenly. Once we got to our room, hubby and I shared our ""snack"". OMG!! I'm so so sad wE didn't order more! We argued about which was better- I say squid, he says bao. Either which way, whEn we return for a concert in May- we'll come better prepared and more aware and definitely order more!

Customer service was great too- just throwing that out there!"
Banh Mi Boys	5	2019-10-01	What a fabulous meal we had! Stopped in for a light late lunch. We had the 5 spice pork bao and the grilled chicken taco.  Both were full of flavor and super delish!  No wait. Friendly staff.  Thanks BMB!
Banh Mi Boys	5	2020-01-30	"Let's talk bánh mì. It's the Vietnamese word for ""bread"" and it also refers to a pretty popular sandwich. Baguettes were introduced to Vietnam by the French and in the 1950s the bánh mì sandwich was born, one of the original fusion foods. You can find endless versions of bánh mì today but the original (and arguably best, in by opinion) usually involves a few different types of deli-style meat, pâté, chili, mayonnaise and is topped with cucumber, pickled carrots, pickled daikon and cilantro. It is served cold. I love this straight-up classic version because of the perfect marriage of Vietnamese and French ingredients.
When it comes to bánh mì in Toronto, everyone talks about Banh Mi Boys. You Gotta Eat Here! featured them in season two of the show, National Geographic magazine included them in their Places of a Lifetime article about Toronto, NOW Toronto has voted them #1 Best Sandwich 2019, and blogTO has named them as the #1 Best Banh Mi in Toronto. The hype is real. They now have four locations in the city, but you know me, I've gotta visit the orig. Fashion District. I stopped in to the little shop on a Saturday evening, excited for some bread with stuff inside of it.

Like I said, the shop is small and you won't find very much in terms of decor. Honestly though, in my experience the absolute best bánh mì shops are the ones that look like complete trash. So in that sense, Banh Mi Boys is almost too nice. The red pendant lighting is decently atmospheric and there are rustic wood panels on the walls - I certainly wouldn't call the place a ""hole in the wall."" As with most casual joints, you go up to the counter to place your order and grab a spot to sit. While there always seemed to be tables available in the restaurant, the traffic coming in and out of the shop was constant. Many people were taking their sandwiches to go.

One of my favourite things to do in restaurants of varying ethnicities is to try their most interesting drink! It's usually something imported from the respective country and I'm always super into trying whatever they've got. In this case it was a can of Yeo's Chrysanthemum Tea Drink ($1.70). Delish! Kind of like drinking an iced tea, except with a lovely sweet honey flavour.

The menu at Banh Mi Boys includes more than just bánh mì. You'll also find tacos and steamed bao, as well as a few different sides. I liked seeing a green papaya salad on the menu as a nice fresh option... But was truly intrigued by the Kimchi Fries (Pulled pork, mayo, kimchi, green onion - $7.50). They had to happen. This was like an Asian poutine, for lack of a better way to describe it! And wow was it ever good! I think the aspect that surprised me the most was that the fries were actually quite delicious and cooked well. The rest of the ingredients are a no-brainer when it comes to a one-way ticket to delicious town. I loved the huge flavours in every bite! The pulled pork was savoury and well-seasoned while the kimchi brought its signature spicy fermented funk. And of course anything with mayo on it is going to be good. I'm not sure why my expectations were apprehensive on this one because I was completely blown away. An absolute must-try.

The main show, of course, is the bánh mì. There are nine different sandwiches to choose from, all innovative riffs on the classic. Call me a traditionalist, but I did find myself just a little disappointed that there is no straight classic bánh mì offered on the menu. Mostly because I know that if there was, they would crush it. However, I can certainly appreciate that they have created nine out-of-the-box sandwiches using some truly incredible ingredients ranging from squid to 5 spice pork belly. There is one sandwich on the menu that everyone seems to talk about though and it was the one that I had to try for myself: Duck Confit (Served on a baguette with pickled carrot, cucumber, cilantro, Luck sauce and onion chutney - $9.00). The first and most important thing about a bánh mì sandwich is the baguette. Hands down. It needs to be fresh with a thin, crusty outside and a soft, chewy inside. If the bread is wrong, you might as well forget the whole thing. In this case, the baguette was ideal, providing just the right bite without overpowering the whole sandwich with too much breadiness. Served as a warm sandwich, the generous amount of duck confit was tender and delicious. I loved the way that the Asian flavours from the Luck sauce played with the rich and savoury meat. The vegetables were piled high, adding a beautiful pop of freshness and colour. I couldn't help but love this. It certainly wasn't a traditional bánh mì, but what it was was delicious.

One of the main characteristics of bánh mì shops tend to be the rock bottom prices. Typically a sandwich will run you about $3, which is pretty much the best thing ever. You likely noticed that this isn't the case at Banh Mi Boys, with their sandwiches going for about three times that price. Keep in mind that they are offerin"
Banh Mi Boys	5	2019-08-18	"This is my favourite place to come for Asian inspired sandwiches whenever I'm in Toronto. I love all the different meat choices they offer. I love their lemongrass chicken sandwich and kimchi fries which are to die for. Everything is simple and the ingredients are always fresh. I really wish they would open a location in mississauga/oakville/ brampton area so I could be a regular.

Their prices are also very reasonable too so this gives them a perfect score in my eyes."
Banh Mi Boys	5	2019-08-17	Great experience! Friendly and quick customer service, spotless restaurant, and bomb food. I only ordered the kimchi fries but they were done to perfection. The staff is wonderful and the food is even better. Great quick bite in Toronto.
Banh Mi Boys	5	2020-02-20	"I can see why Banh Mi's are popular - really great food for great value.

Have had the Kalbi Beef 2x and 5 Spice Pork within the last week. So, so nice. Was my first experience of Vietnamese food in Toronto & it didn't disappoint. 5 stars."
Banh Mi Boys	4	2019-06-26	"Banh Mi Boys was our first stop for food in Toronto. We waited in a line and ordered the five spice pork belly banh mi, kimchi fries with pulled pork, mayo, kimchi, and green onion, and a tofu taco with cucumber, slaw, carrots, cilantro, and mayo. I thought the prices were maybe a little high for being considered ""$"" as listed in Yelp, but the prices were definitely still good. I would describe the food here as very American Asian fusion (and that's not necessarily a bad thing!). 

My husband enjoyed the banh mi, and we both were TOTALLY wowed by the kimchi fries. These are a must-order!!! They do not skimp at all on all the toppings, so it's really excellent value. I don't eat meat, but it was very easy to pick around the pulled pork, for the most part. The tofu taco was a little underwhelming, which is why I rated this place four stars instead of five. I'm assuming the tofu taco is not what they're known for. ;) It was definitely good, but there was very little flavor to it. The tofu was very plain. I think it would have been better if it had had kimchi!

I feel like I want to try this place again so I can try more items on the menu. I'm sure there might be a few outstanding dishes that I just didn't get the chance to try when I was here! We will definitely be back."
Byblos	5	2020-05-10	"I give this restaurant five stars. I have only eaten at Byblos once but it is a fantastic restaurant and we will definitely be back. I went to Byblos with my wife for our anniversary and it was one of the best dining experiences we've ever had -  I honestly think we spent three hours there. The service was incredible, the restaurants decor and ambience was lovely, and the food was absolutely delicious.

We shared a bottle of red wine, the artichoke labneh and roasted cauliflower appetizers, the lamb shoulder (with five sides) for two as the main and for dessert, pavlova. 

I highly recommend Byblos to everyone. Five stars."
Byblos	4	2020-01-28	"Came into Byblos excited to try what everyone has been raving about. Started off with one of their tea cocktails which was actually very refreshing and unique, definitely a must try. After reading some reviews, we decided to order the Turkish dumplings, which to my disappointment was kind of underwhelming and tasteless. 

HOWEVER - the roasted red beets was amaazing! My favourite dish. It came with labneh (yogurt) and delicious bread. 5/5

We also ordered the OXtail starter  which was pretty good and the crunch on the fried breading was amazing. 

Overall good ambience and great dishes, dumplings were disappointing but might be back to try more..."
Byblos	4	2020-01-15	"Food: 4/5
Atmosphere: 5/5
Service: 4/5

Wow finally a review from me that's not on poke bowls or Asian food! Byblos was everything that I expected based on the awesome reviews from friends and here on Yelp. First of all, the service and atmosphere were top-notch. I was here with a group of 4 girls and we were seated at a cozy round booth upstairs. Our server was honestly so helpful and offered up some great suggestions. For example, we initially wanted to share a couple apps, some mains and carbs, etc. but we were unsure about how much to order. She suggested that 8 dishes would be a good start since they usually recommend 2 dishes per person because the portion sizes are small. And by small portion sizes, they were SMALL. This was good in the sense that we were able to share a lot more items, but also meant that the bill was quite hefty so it definitely is more of a nicer meal. Here is a list of what we ordered and my rankings (I don't remember the exact names sorry): 

Favs - Roasted beets, Spinach pide (so creamy and delicious), Short rib kebab (so tender!) 
Average - Turkish dumplings, Black truffle rice
Meh - Spanish Octopus (5 tiny pieces lol), Fried chicken (very dry and not much flavour) 

I would definitely come back to try some of their other dishes when I feel like treating myself because the meal came to almost $70 per person (with one drink)."
Byblos	5	2019-10-10	"Read about it as one of the top-100 restaurants in Toronto and more than lived up to the hype.  The place had a nice cool but casual vibe.  Service was very efficient, water and wine were constantly kept full and service was always present but not obtrusive.  

The food was the highlight.  We were a group of 4 and share four dishes from the starter side of the menu, three mains, a rice and a couple of veg.  For the starters, the highlight for me (for the meal actually) were the lamb ribs.  Also really enjoyed the hummus with wagyu.  My only disappointment was the ahi, it did not have as much flavor as I expected (and tuna is one of my favorite meats).  I also expected it to be slices rather than a tartare diced style.  Not bad but not as great as the ribs or hummus.

For mains, we went with the signature dish, lamb shoulder, which was excellent and a very good sized portion.  I also enjoyed the middle eastern fried chicken, lots of flavor.  I found the salmon good but not incredible.  I love Brussels sprouts and theirs were excellent.  Also enjoyed the cauliflower.

I skipped dessert but my colleagues loved the sorbet and pistachio ice cream.  Overall, a great meal."
Byblos	5	2019-10-07	"This place is actually 2 floors and most nights require a booking. Tables are big and comfy far apart. Can accommodate large groups. I would say the food is a middle eastern fusion. The service is wonderful. Place is a bit dressy so no baseball hat or sweat pants. You can wear those things but just might be uncomfortable with everyone else dressed up a bit. Food is a bit expensive around $30/$50 for main.

Food recommend: definitely the app with the dumpling in yogurt. The yogurt is middle eastern so a bit sour but sweat. Really good. Trick is to ask for bread (free) for the sauce after. 

We got the lamb shoulder as the main. You make your own wrap. The lamb is 24 hour roasted. I would probably get something else next time. Just wasnt unique enough for the price (felt like i was making my own shwarma). I would get the lamb rib app of you like lamb."
Byblos	3	2019-09-14	"The food and cocktails were exceptional. Truly. We tried the ahi tuna, beets with labneh, black truffle rice, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, marcona almonds and olives. All delicious and beautiful.  

Unfortunately, our server was a bit snooty. She didn't seem to approve of our ordering style, which was surprising considering the menu seemed to emphasize shareables. We preferred to try many small plates as opposed to a main. Nonetheless, she kept pushing for more; insisting the sides and rice were meant to be paired with a main protein."
Byblos	5	2020-01-03	"Solid dishes, great atmosphere. I love the concept of family style sharing of the dishes, which were recommended to us.

The best we had which I highly recommend:

-Eggplant kibbeh
-seared cauliflower 
-Spanish octopus
-ME fried chicken
-beef tartare 
- Turkish manti dumplings (the best ever)

Just order a little of everything and you can't go wrong!!"
Byblos	5	2019-08-13	"Amazing food and amazing experience. Our server was very helpful. We thought the portion sizes were going to be small so we were going to order too much but he helped us out a lot.

We started with the manti dumplings and the truffle pidhe which were both amazing. I'm still drooling at the thought of the mushrooms. Definitely a must try! Then we got the brussel sprouts and the lamb for two. Both were amazing. The sprouts came with halloumi cheese. The lamb came on a tray with toppings to build your own wraps. It was so much food we got some to go 

We also got the tea service and ordered mint tea. It came with Turkish delight as appertiffs. It was amazing! The more we drank it the hungrier we got.

We were too full for a dessert so we just got saffron ice cream and Turkish coffee. Both were amazing. Such a great meal."
Byblos	5	2019-08-30	"A truly elevated dining experience! I'd say the food above all. Quality is impeccable. The dumplings are an absolute must have. Stuffed with creamy eggplant in a heavenly yoghurt sauce. The meats were also done just right, lamb being so tender and not gamey at all, not salty, the flavors subtle and well balanced. Had an old fashioned with hints of coffee and of course a real big ice cube. Decor is classy but nothing special, was hoping for something more unique but the food makes up for it all.

Warning: it is expensive so be prepared to spend around 80-100$ per person if you get drinks."
Byblos	4	2020-01-08	"Ok here's the thing.

I'm super into middle eastern cuisine, and this is definitely not what you'd expect.

If I'm judging it based on middle eastern influenced cuisine, I'd say I loved it.

The menu was a mish mash of the best bits of a few middle eastern countries put together with some interesting cocktails and great presentation.

The portions are tiny, but for me that was great because I got to really try out a ton of their menu.

I came here for a friends birthday in a group of 6 and the service was excellent. They helped us order a decent amount and the food was staggered perfectly for us to enjoy mezze style which I really enjoyed. I'd happily come here again (on someone elses tab)"
Byblos	5	2019-07-18	"HOLY DELICIOUS! We had a really hard time narrowing down where we wanted to go when we were visiting Toronto so I did a lot of research on Yelp and kept coming across Byblos. Everything on the menu sounded amazing and they had reservation availability so we decided to check it out. I will say the outside of the restaurant is not very appealing and we were kind of hoping to sit outside but they do not have an outdoor patio. That was okay though because when you walk inside, the ambiance is very neat with a modern Mediterranean flare to it. We were seated on the downstairs level but we quickly realized that they have a massive upstairs area with a full bar and tables that accommodate larger groups. We were okay with being downstairs though because it was a bit quieter. 

Usually we a bottle of wine kind of couple but their cocktails sounded incredible so we decided to only do those. SO MANY OPTIONS. All very unique from what goes in the drink to the final presentation. I wish I knew the name of the one drink I had because it was delicious. I really enjoyed their spiced G&T as well. You can tell the bartender's put a lot of work and thought into these drinks.

For dinner, they suggest about 4-5 items because their menu is meant to be shared family style. After a lot of help from our server who was excellent in giving recommendations, we decided to order the turkish manti dumplings, black truffle wood fired pide, short rib kebab and a side of their roasted brussels sprouts. They did a great job timing these items out so they came out one by one so when we finished one plate, the next one was on its way to our table. Everything was fantastic but if you were only going to order one thing from this menu, it would have to be the dumplings. THEY WERE INCREDIBLE. The sauce they came in were so good we actually dunked out pide into the dish as well. 

We were very happy to come across this place and would recommend it to anyone that was looking for a great date night option or just getting together with friends, they have something for everyone."
Byblos	5	2019-06-29	"My friends and I came here for dinner last Friday night during my bachelorette trip. We sat near the chef's counter and were able to see the food prepared and brought out. The menu items are small plates and we ordered several items to share amongst us all. All of our drinks were not only delicious but also were so appealing to look at! We unfortunately did not try too many of the menu items as we were coming from a late lunch but the flatbread, fries, and salad that we did have were all delicious!! 
I would absolutely come back again to try more menu items next time I happen to be visiting Toronto."
Byblos	5	2019-04-12	"Came here with my company after our training and was spoiled with Byblos' amazing service and delectable $85 course menu. Upon seeing the menu, I assumed that we would choose one plate within each section; little did I know that we actually get served all 11 dishes and share family style!

My neighbour was vegetarian, and Byblos made a great effort to create fitting and suitable dishes to ensure that he had an equally enjoyable experience. He had an equally massive portion for each modification, and naturally wasn't able to finish it all - so I was fortunate to also sample his plates. As a result, I swear my dinner ended up being upwards of 15 courses...

First Course
Roasted Red Beets
Sweet beets dipped in what I suspect to be honey were served on a bed of labneh, a tangy substance similar to Greek yogurt. We had a plentitude of barbari bread, a long bread topped with spices and olive oil, which was intended to be eaten with the yogurt. Though good, this dish didn't particularly stand out to me.

Steak Tartare
Topped with labneh, the minced raw steak was marinated in red chili. Subsequently, it had a very nice mildly spicy kick. It was quite enjoyable, and I found the flavours stood out even more when eaten without the labneh. Unlike what's stated on their site, however, we weren't given pita to accompany the dish.

Lamb Ribs
Though most people rave about this dish, I actually didn't quite enjoy it. The meat was tender and fell off the bone quite easily; however, I found it to be too sweet and overly seasoned. In my opinion, the date molasses was overpowering and stole away from all the other flavours.

Second Course
Fig
This salad, with its leafy greens, creamy tangy cheese, crunchy seeds, and sweet vinaigrette, is honestly one of my favourite salads in the city. I'm fairly sure I had one entire bowl to myself - I loved it that much! It's a great light dish that serves well as a palette cleanser in between the meat dishes.

Ora King Salmon
The salmon was perfectly cooked! The flesh was outstandingly moist while the skin was delightfully crunchy. Again, I'm not embarrassed to admit that I probably had one full fillet to myself (the number of dishes far exceeded the number of people at my table). I wasn't the biggest fan of the tomato harissa / sumac sauce, but the dish was well executed.

Black Truffle Pide
I didn't realize what I was missing out on until I sampled this dish. A melted melange of cheese and truffle was hugged and enveloped by a hearty carby flat bread. This pide is dangerous!

At this time, my friend was also served his veggie options. He had a Wild Mushroom pide, which frankly paled in comparison to the black truffle one. He was also given an off-menu item - a delicious hummus served with pita bread topped with olive oil. I had some and it was great hummus!

Third Course
Dry Aged Ribeye
This steak was amazing! It was perfectly cooked to a beautiful medium rare, served atop smoked eggplant. The flavours were so rich and buttery, and the meat was tender and flavourful. I had two pieces and wanted more. At this point in time, most of us were filling up, so we ended up having a lot of steak leftover (almost two full plates put together). But fear not! I don't let any food go to waste, and asked for it to go (although the portion given to me ended up being much smaller... I had only two pieces of steak).

Black Truffle Rice
This basmati rice was so fragrant - I really do think the addition of fresh mushrooms made a significant difference in highlighting the earthy and umami flavours. I wasn't as big a fan of the creme fraiche, and wished we didn't mix it together. The addition of fried shallots and chickpeas also added a lovely crunch and texture.

Grilled Carrots
This was a simple side dish that was really well executed. The perfect companion to the meaty ribeye.

My vegetarian friend was given Roasted Brussels Sprouts (I'm honestly certain they're fried) which were undoubtedly one of the best executed vegetable dishes of the night. I particularly enjoyed the creamy tahini and yogurt that lightly dressed the veggies. I enjoyed the cauliflower a little less. He was also given Thrice-Cooked Fries, which were amazingly crispy.

Desserts
Hazelnut Chocolate Mousse
I don't know how I managed to eat another bite, and yet I almost singlehandedly demolished this entire plate. The mousse was so creamy, encased in a crunchy chocolate shell. I loved the sugar toffee hazelnuts, which added a satisfying crunch. Would definitely order again, because I'm a sucker for chocolate mousse.

Baklava 
I've had this dish before, and still don't particularly enjoy it...

The service was absolutely phenomenal! The servers are very approachable, attentive, and patient. They take the time to explain each dish, including cocktails. I really did enjoy my signature cocktail (the Geographer), though the alcohol went straight to my head. I love Byblos and look forward to coming again!"
Byblos	4	2019-10-27	"Byblos is one of the top rated restaurants in Toronto and one of my personal favourites. This place is perfect for any occasion and never disappoints. 

RESTAURANT: The decor of the restaurant is beautiful with dim lighting. There are two floors to the place but I've only ever sat on the main floor. The seating is a bit tight but you are still able to sit comfortably. The service is always great and attentive.

FOOD: For starters, I recommend the roasted red beets which comes with barbari bread (like who doesn't love carbs) and their eggplant kibbeh. you MUST try their pides if you ever come here, they are so delicious. Their black truffle rice is already very aromatic and a bit more filling. Overall, the flavours of their dishes are so unique, you'll want to come back and try the whole menu."
Byblos	5	2019-05-30	"AMAZING. We really enjoy Mediterranean cuisine but it's always been pretty traditional fare. Byblos does it different.  You may have tried dishes that were similar to it in the past, but I guarantee they will surprise and delight your taste buds.

First off, cocktails are a must.  I ordered the ""Sultan's Privilege"".  The bartender is very talented...highly recommend one of their signature cocktails.

We ordered the roasted red beets (think bread with yogurt dip),l and Turkish mantis dumplings.  Both we delicious and completely not what we expected.

Next we ordered the grilled whole branzino with the sweet jewelled rice, and roasted Brussels sprouts (sides are ordered a la carte). The fish was perfectly cooked...juicy and flighty flaky white fish, with beautiful parsley rub and crunchy skin, Brussels sprouts were very tasty, and the rice was a delightful balance of sweet and savoury.

Finally for dessert we ordered the orange blossom mousse and the pizzelle. Both were a perfect way to finish off our meal."
Byblos	5	2019-09-29	"BY FAR my favourite place to go for a special night out! There's a lot of places in Toronto that have a great ambiance but the food is sub-par, but at Byblos the interior is beautiful and the food is delicious. 

We've been here twice and each time, the servers were super helpful and suggested that we order 5-6 dishes as they're smaller plates and we could share them. They also gave good recommendations of what dishes would compliment each other. Just a note that it is $$$, which is why I only go usually go on special occasions but definitely worth it. 

Dishes that I think you absolutely have to order are the lamb ribs and the Turkish manti dumplings, I wish I could have multiple orders of them myself. The middle eastern fried chicken is also really good. Fries are good but you could skip them. Our first visit we split the shawarma for two and they give you pitas, garlic sauce and veggies to make it yourself and we liked that as well but not as much as the other dishes. 

Definitely will be going back again and again."
Byblos	5	2019-02-17	"Contemporary classic lounge fitting for a modern Mediterranean meal. 

Service: The memory of our server was amazing, and she offered some great suggestions for our meal. Had our order down, including the right additions and substitutions without having to write anything down. Was always topping up our water, and the servers cleared our plates/replaced them when they were dirty. Each and every dish was explained to us.

Food: The lamb ribs were fragrant with the scent of sesame and very tender, definitely a must-get. Manti dumplings were interesting, but not a fan of the yogurt sauce. Pide was also delicious, but the cheese masked most of the truffle flavour. Wagyu was cooked perfectly, and the onion and black garlic complimented it very well. Would also get the short rib kebab again and the signature dish from day one the restaurant opened, the roasted lamb shoulder. Topped everything off with a delicious burnt honey ice cream, a perfect ending to the rich experience.

Overall: Dishes were perfectly balanced and seasoned well with Mediterranean spices and flavours - perfect for sharing, although a bit pricey for the portion sizes. Modern take on traditional dishes served in a tapas format.

Tip: Ask for seating upstairs for a more intimate/classy lounge (more dimly lit), main floor seating for a more formal dining experience. Reserve early, as spots get taken up quickly!"
Byblos	2	2019-08-09	"Food was nothing special and food took a while to come out. We had the fried chicken - which lacked flavour nothing too great to be raves about. As sides we ordered the cauliflower and Brussels sprouts - which basically tasted like boiled vegetables which also lacked flavours. 
Overall wasn't super impressed, the only thing nice was really the inside of the restaurant with the aesthetics

Follow @cindysfood on instagram for more reviews!"
Byblos	4	2019-07-30	"Came here for a weeknight dinner with my boyfriend and our friend visiting from out of town. Overall, the food is just a fancy take on Mediterranean food - delicious yet pricey. Had it not been for our server (who was beyond funny and provided the best service), this would have been a 3 star review. Our party appreciates elevated service when it comes to  upscale dining facilities with premium prices, and she absolutely nailed it.

We started off with cocktails, and the nightingale sour was the clear winner among the round we ordered. It's the perfect cocktail to quench your thirst, with sweet and floral notes (coming from the peach and orange blossom). We also tried the marrakesh garden which was also refreshing, but forgettable.

For our appetizers and mains, we ordered:

Turkish manti dumplings - eggplant dumplings drizzled with a super rich yogurt sauce. Highly recommend.

Fig salad - heavy orange blossom notes on this refreshing and delicate salad. It's almost too beautiful to eat, but safe to say this was gone in a jiff.

Black truffle pide - this flatbread was nothing spectacular. To be frank, I am not so much a truffle lover, but my truffle-loving friends agreed this was a simple dish not worth swooning over.

Grilled whole branzino - though the flavours were great - smoky and lemon-y - the branzino was overdone. It was hard to justify the $39 price tag on this one.

Persian kale rice - this was an overwhelming portion for 2-3 people (which is not a bad thing!). I appreciated the crunch from the fragrant rice and lentils, but this again is a dish not worth swooning over.

Roasted brussel sprouts - our sprouts came out pretty burnt which was disappointing. Any flavours from the halloumi, tahini, and yogurt were missed due to the charred leaves."
Byblos	5	2019-03-25	"No complaints about anything! I'm sort of surprised at some of these reviews. We were promptly seated upon arriving. The decor and ambiance are chic and laid back. 

Our party of 4 wasn't exactly ravenous so we ordered less than the recommended amount of dishes. We got the beet and labneh, oxtail dumplings, lamb shoulder for two, short rib kebab, tah dig, and fries. We were STUFFED. Everything was hearty and delicious. The balance of flavors in each dish was great, especially the tah dig and short rib kebab. Those were probably my two favorite things. All of the meats were perfectly cooked and super tender. 

Dinner was less expensive than we thought so that was a plus on top of everything. I would definitely recommend it for a dinner date with friends or a partner."
Bang Bang Ice Cream and Bakery	5	2020-03-17	"My favourite ice cream shop in Toronto! Huge line ups during the summer, but I think it's worth it! There's no seating but in the summer it's a nice area to walk around in anyways. 

Genmaicha Matcha Tiramisu (Highly Recommended) -- I've yet to try an ice cream flavour I don't like at Bang Bang. They have so many unique flavours (e.g. totaro, london fog and boba milk tea) and delicious baked goods to pair with them. The Genmaicha Matcha Tiramisu is one of my favourite flavours - creamy, rich vanilla ice cream with huge chunks of soft matcha tiramisu. I think the genmaicha and alcohol is more prevalent than the matcha, but I'm not bothered by it because I think the combination works very well. My other go-to flavour is the lychee rosewater with raspberry; pretty much everyone I know is IN LOVE with it.  If you haven't been before, you NEED to go this summer! ⁣
⁣
TIP: Avoid peak times (i.e. after dinner) because the line can get pretty long. ⁣"
Bang Bang Ice Cream and Bakery	4	2020-03-09	"I consider myself something of an ice cream expert, mostly in that I will happily taste test as much as possible.  
I've been to Bang Bang twice, and on my first go-round, I tried the golden oreo ice cream, just in a cup.  It was delicious and a fun spin on your usual cookies and cream. Last night, I braved the long line that accompanied the unseasonably nice weather and went for a half-sandwich.  I got the peanut butter ice cream (I went for two scoops of the same rather than two different flavours) with an Everything cookie.  It was easily the best peanut butter ice cream I've ever tried - chunks of PB, Reece's Pieces, chocolate pieces - and the cookie was good too.  I probably could've gone without the cookie, not because it wasn't good, but because walking and eating wasn't easy and I probably could've saved myself the mess if I'd just gotten ice cream in a cup.
A bit pricy, but it's a treat you don't have all the time.  I'll be back to sample more of the unique flavours!"
Bang Bang Ice Cream and Bakery	5	2020-02-25	"Miso mon cheri, matcha tiramisu, campfire marshmallow, mango puddin'... These are all ICE CREAM flavors, y'all! 

It was 20 degrees (Farenheit) and we had just stuffed ourselves silly with poutine, yet were looking to waste time, when my eyes landed on Bang Bang. It took one peek inside at the wall of flavors to know we had to try some. The staff was super sweet and let us sample to our heart's content. In the end, we landed on a small cup of London Fog and Totaro. I loved how we could get two different flavors even in their smallest size. The combo was perfect and unique, but do yourself a favor and try some samples and listen to the staff's recommendations.

Now, they do a rad ice cream sandwich here with freshly baked cookies. I wish I was more hungry to go for it, but simply ice cream was divine, too. 

It's tiny, but we squeezed on a bench to enjoy our ice cream, while my husband also sipped a tea.

This would definitely be a regular stop for me if I lived nearby, no matter the weather!"
Bang Bang Ice Cream and Bakery	3	2020-01-22	"Sort of an overhyped ice cream shop.

They indeed offer unique flavours, but it's significantly more expensive than necessary. Their flavours are fun to try if you haven't been here, but I would probably never return with their exuberant prices. Two tiny scoops of ice cream can run you nearly $10. You can find plenty of ice cream shops with unique flavours for way less.
Their ice cream is also super melty as well. As soon as I got it, it was already melting all over the place. If you're into soft serve, this is your spot--but I'm a hard serve ice cream kind of person."
Bang Bang Ice Cream and Bakery	4	2020-01-12	"I can see why bang bang is so popular due to their unique flavours. In the summer sometimes I see lineups around the block! 

I got an ice cream sandwich with Totoro and Lychee Rosewater ice cream. Totoro pretty much tastes like taro milk tea! Lychee rosewater had a tang to it which was refreshing as well. I actually would not recommend and ice cream sandwich though; every time you type to eat it like a normal ice cream sandwich, the ice cream will slide out. So it's best to eat the ice cream and cookies separately. I would go with either ice cream in a cup or in an egg waffle instead (this is a meal in itself though!)"
Bang Bang Ice Cream and Bakery	4	2019-10-01	"This was my last stop in Toronto before heading back to the States and it certainly did not disappoint. My boyfriend and I arrived a little before the store's opening time but there was already a group of people who were waiting ahead of us. After we got in line, many people started to line up behind us which made me feel eternally grateful that we got here earlier than expected to avoid a long wait time.

Once the store opened my nose was filled with the aroma of freshly baked cookies. The line moved quickly and we didn't end up waiting too long until we were able to place our order. We ended up getting one scoop of london fog and one scoop of burnt toffee on a sugar cone. Both of these flavors complimented each other very well but if I can only choose one, my vote would be on London fog. The light taste of earl grey made this sweet treat taste even more decadent. The burnt toffee had some pretty large bits of toffee mixed in which did make it hard to solely appreciate the ice cream itself.

Do note that there is no seating inside. There are a few benches outside which fill up quickly so space is pretty limited. Make sure you have a back up plan of where you can enjoy your delicious goodness!"
Bang Bang Ice Cream and Bakery	5	2020-02-15	"Bang Bang is likely the ice cream spot that you hear always recommended if you are looking for a good scoop of ice cream in Toronto. You might ask yourself is it really worth the hype and to wait the lineups? Yes. Yes it freaking is.

The flavors here are not your run-of-the-mill ice cream shop flavors. Most are unique in taste and name. You can get your ice cream in a cone, cup, freshly-made waffle cup, as an ice cream sandwich and more! The shop is very, very small. It acts more like a take-out place than an ice cream parlour. 

I honestly would recommend you go maybe 15-30 minutes before it opens and line up. That way you get their freshest scoops and treats without having to wait an hour or more."
Bang Bang Ice Cream and Bakery	5	2019-08-18	"By far my favorite part about visiting a new city is seeking out (and often waiting in line for) their flagship ice cream shop. Surely Bang Bang Ice Cream and Bakery is Toronto's best, and it was worth every minute of my forty-five minute wait on a Friday evening. 

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?

Yes, the lines at Bang Bang can spiral seemingly out of control, but the neighborhood is conducive to it, there's signage, and above all else it's worth it. Even though they're surely swamped at all hours of the day, the servers are friendly and efficient. 

One of my favorite parts of Bang Bang was that, to keep things moving, they curb tasting during peak hours, which honestly makes a lot of sense. Think about it - when you go elsewhere, to say a restaurant, are you able to sample what you order beforehand? Of course not, and in this case it's a reasonable trade off to keep the line moving. Star. 

Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?

$8.90 CAD got me a colossal ice cream sandwich packed with two full sized scoops. While I initially scoffed a bit at the price point, after a quick bit of math I realized that for well under $10.00 I was getting two scoops of specialty ice cream and two everything cookies, which was a bargain. Star. 

Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?

I don't have enough superlatives in my vocabulary to describe how amazing this all was. For starters, the everything cookie is a new benchmark for amazing cookies, and I could have eaten a dozen of these and been perfectly content. From there, the Burnt Toffee and CinnaCrunch ice creams were absolutely out of this world, and competed easily with some of my favorites elsewhere around North America. Amazing. Two Stars. 

Star 5: Would you be excited to go back?

This was some of the best ice cream I've ever had, and surely Bang Bang has perfected the dessert shop here in Toronto. Star."
Bang Bang Ice Cream and Bakery	5	2019-10-21	"Super delicious icecream! And totally worth the lineup! ( however I was lucky to come on a day there wasn't one, keeping in mind I have waited about five years now to try it ha ha) 

I recently visited this ice cream shop not expecting to find that they also serve very delicious baked goods such as carrot cake and delicious cinnamon rolls. 

This time we went for the bubble waffle cone filled with buttered mint and lychee rosewater ice cream, With a side of butterscotch ice cream.  

The flavours here are amazing and very rich. It is infused perfectly and worth the price. They have a variety of different flavours so many that it is very difficult to choose! And also they offer delivery with Uber eats ( Uh oh I am introuble ) 

10/10 recommend this place !!!"
Bang Bang Ice Cream and Bakery	4	2019-10-12	"Great flavours at this sweet little shop on Ossington! 
My fav are London Fog and Cinnatoast. Get the cookie Sammie's! 
Tons of cream (obvi) so lactose intolerant people plz be aware! Tried avocado and thought it tasted weird."
Bang Bang Ice Cream and Bakery	5	2019-09-21	"Instant 5 stars because with only a limit of one sample, I managed to choose two delicious icecream flavours with a HK waffle. Waited all summer and finally got a chance to stop by after dinner. Wait time: approximately 30 minutes total with your dessert in hand (and it was worth it).

Lychee raspberry and the matcha twist with jasmine blew my mind. They are faster now with waffle orders so checkout was quick and efficient. Got to try a bit of the boba papa icecream and it was good as well. Tapioca is an extra $0.50 as a topping."
Bang Bang Ice Cream and Bakery	5	2019-07-24	"After having been here a few times, I can't believe that I'm just getting to review this place now! Bang Bang Ice Cream is right up there with Kekou Gelato in my books for best ice cream places in TO. Waiting in line here is pretty common any day of the week and especially in the evenings but for good reason!

This place is amazing because of the many ice cream options available. I love how there are so many unique flavours to choose from that you can never really get tired of coming here and can pick a different flavour each time depending on what you feel like having. Some of the flavours include burnt toffee (a personal fave!), lychee rosewater, totaro, london fog, milk and cookies, matcha, etc. Some flavours are also rotated as I don't always see certain ones whenever I've visited. 

You can also have your ice cream as part of an ice cream sandwich (half or full) since there are various cookie flavours to choose from and I remember that you could do a macaron ice cream sandwich at one point. Of course, there's also the popular waffle and ice cream combination. A bonus is that small tubs of select flavours are available here too. The prices are fair for what you pay for and a perfect treat in the summer heat!"
Bang Bang Ice Cream and Bakery	5	2019-08-04	"We've waited about 45 minutes on line for this. I would say it was worth the wait! The place itself isn't that big of an interior and due to the long line of people you won't be able to stay in the store for long after you've received your order. 

The service was really good and they were nice in letting us try different flavors since there is so many  flavors to choose from and they all sound so good! From the flavors that I have gotten was the Thank You Very Matcha which was so good. My brother who doesn't even like matcha also enjoyed it. The Golden Oreo however was pretty sweet. A huge oreo ice cream fam but thought that this one was kinda sweet. I would definitely stop by again if I had a chance and the cookies just made it 100x better!"
Bang Bang Ice Cream and Bakery	5	2019-08-29	"MY FAVOURITE ice cream place in Toronto! The waits in the summer and fall time are no joke, but come here after a nice dinner and wait in line to burn off those dinner calories ;) 

Their flavour combos are so unique, but also yummy and it's good on its own, in a waffle cone, normal cone, or in between cookies!

My personal favourites are rosewater lychee, good humour me, coconut mango puddin, and boba papa milk tea 

Pro tip: always get 2 flavours and if you really like one that's available in the pint size, take that to go for home"
Bang Bang Ice Cream and Bakery	4	2019-07-06	"Bang bang, into my heart you ice cream fiend. I think I found Toronto's baddest ice cream shop and am reviewing it for my 1400th review on Yelp!

This popular ice cream joint was made for the ice cream connoisseur. The moment you walk in, you are greeted with so many options that are made weekly to serve. From London Fog to even boba, there were some really unique flavors that you could sample. I was a huge fan of their mango sticky rice which used actual rice in their ice cream. The small grain made such a difference in texture and taste.

Once you've chosen your ice cream(s), you choose how you want it presented whether as an ice cream cookie sandwich, a waffle cone, or just in a cup. Altogether, you can really modify and change how you enjoy this delectable dessert. Each cup ends up being about $7 so it's on the steeper side but the quality makes up for the price.

The ice cream here at Bang Bang was on point. So smooth, creamy, and worth the wait you may endure.

Overall service was good but I did feel some pressure in selecting my ice cream and cone choice. There was no line when we first arrived but shortly after, it picked up. Before I even got a chance to try all the flavors I wanted, I felt the side eye from the server and quickly chose and left."
Bang Bang Ice Cream and Bakery	5	2019-08-05	"The only place I'd go for ice cream in the winter. Thee best ice cream shop in all of GTA! Well worth the line up. The ginger cookie is my fave. So many delicious flavours! London Fog, taro, lychee, mint, chocolate..

Matcha jasmine 
Milk tea: can add tapioca pearls (bubbles/boba) for 50cents"
Bang Bang Ice Cream and Bakery	5	2019-05-24	"Yes, this place is still expensive. Yes, this place still has a line out the door on a sunny weekend day, but damn. It's really good! 

Bang Bang has expanded their repertoire to include other baked goods aside from the cookies for their ice cream sandwiches. I highly recommend their Peanut Butter and Jelly ice cream which they almost always have, and their cinnamon buns. Bang appetit."
Bang Bang Ice Cream and Bakery	5	2019-07-24	"""Bang Bang!"" You've got me, agh. During these humid and torird summer days, I'm hallucinating and searching for ways to cool off. My search was no longer during my last day in Toronto. Bang Bang Ice Cream and Bakery has been opened for 3 years and they are cranking out unique and flavorful treats. 

I have never imagined miso being in ice cream, so when I tried the Miso Mon Cheri, I was initially confused, but quickly appreciated the idea that ice cream could taste savory as well. I also ordered a small side of the Totaro (Ube) based on their puff cookies. It was amazing and perfect what I needed. 

With over 20 flavors and 4 vegan flavors, I am not surprised why this is a popular place to visit. The shop is small and there usually is a line so my advice is to head over when they open. I believe I came over around 1pm, but check their hours. Other tip, you can only sample 1 flavor. I'm glad that rule is in place as I would be here all day eating everything. 

Kudos to these chefs back here who are experimenting and perfecting these awesome flavors. Wishing they could open other locations on the West Coast."
Bang Bang Ice Cream and Bakery	4	2019-11-18	"Years ago, when Bang Bang first opened, I braved the cold to wait in an hour long line to get some Totaro ice cream in a bubble waffle cone. It was good, but nothing too memorable that I forgot about this place and moved onto other ice cream spots in the city.

Fast forward five years, after dinner at Mamakas, I decided to give Bang Bang another try. This time, the weather was just above freezing, but fortunately, there was no line up. 

I got a small cup of the burnt toffee flavour. Now this, was delicious. A sweet creamy base with bit of crunchy toffee topped with a toffee drizzle. I savoured every bite. It's been two weeks since I've had it and I'm still thinking about it."
Bang Bang Ice Cream and Bakery	5	2019-12-16	"Bang bang bang. This place was actually kinda hard to find without the GPS. There was nothing really indicating that was the ice cream shop besides the light banner that says ice cream but I wasn't sure if I was at Bang Bang ice cream if that makes sense. 

But regardless the ice cream was pretty good. I don't think it blew me away because I've had alot of good ice cream but I will say all of the flavors were really unique. I got the lychee rosewater and it was amazing. It was lychee ice cream with raspberry flavors swirled in it. I also sampled the totaro and I will say the taro ice cream was definitely something I would come back and get"
Ramen Isshin	5	2020-03-02	"I do not live in Toronto, so for me it was really hard to find a best ramen place. We were browsing for so long and decided to give it a try. They welcomed us nicely and were really quick with the orders. I have some points about this place:
1. Efficient Service
2. Tastiest Ramen I have ever had (Thick Noodle Veggie Ramen)
3. Affordable
4. Clean Toilet
My verdict is best ramen in Toronto. That's it."
Ramen Isshin	2	2020-05-20	"I love Ramen and every winter I'm in Japan . Was dying to try   legendary vegan Isshin ramen  since my English teaser highly recommended . TOO SALTY!! 
In Toronto way more better places . May b other dishes would tests batter , I never back to that one . 
Hope it helps"
Ramen Isshin	5	2020-02-26	"I'd have to say this is the best Ramen I've had in the area. It was the closest to real Japanese Ramen than any other place. I ordered their most popular one, the Spicy Miso Ramen, and It was amazing!! The flavor was so delicious. It didn't have that metal taste like some ramen places. It was great. It wasn't too spicy at all either. My parents also ordered it and they don't like spicy food, and they loved this. 

Another time I also ordered the shoyu ramen and that was delicious as well. If you're looking for an amazing Ramen place, come here! It's so delicious! I'd go to Toronto just for that."
Ramen Isshin	3	2020-02-19	"3.5/5
With so many ramen joints in and around Toronto, this place is just another typical ramen joint. I'm really surprised to hear many say this is their favourite ramen.
Remember to join the yelp waitlist during busy hours but service is usually speedy with quick turnarounds in table. 
Approx. $15 per bowl, portions could be larger but there is the option to add extra noodles for a few dollars."
Ramen Isshin	5	2020-01-23	"Curry tsukemen is delicious. Only available this month.(JAN)

Typical Japanese curry infused with umami flavour goes well with the generous plate of cold noodles for dipping. 

Worth the heavy price tag. 

I don't understand the corn and vegetables since you can't really dip it but nonetheless great flavour. Prefer this over Raku's curry udon any day. Just writing this review is making me crave it."
Ramen Isshin	3	2020-02-08	"Black Sesame Tan Tan:
Nice chewiness of the noodles, and it was very filling despite looking like a small portion. The fun part about this dish is you grind the black sesame and add it to your bowl as you desire! The black sesame added a very fragrant taste. This was a nice experience, however it was too salty for me (apparently a lot of things I eat are too salty for me though??? Something must be wrong with my taste buds). I tried my friends white sesame noodles and that was less salty, and the broth was more light and creamy. I would probably get that instead next time. Glad to finally be able to cross Ramen Isshin off my list"
Ramen Isshin	4	2020-01-15	"Food - I'm a big fan of Spicy Miso so of course I had to get that. This place is known for their spicy miso so, as you can imagine, it's really good. Their broth is rich, tasty, and has a kick to it; I LOVE IT. The noodles and condiments are pretty normal but it's still good. The ramen doesn't come with an egg though so you have to order extra for that. We had the takoyaki and gyoza too. The takoyaki was really good, it's deep fried so the outside is crispy while the inside remains juicy; not convention, I know but its good. Gyoza was pretty good too!

Ambiance - It's a relatively small restaurant with limited seats so be sure to plan ahead if you're coming in as a big group. Aside from that, everything's pretty clean and has a typical ramen shop interior.

Price - my bowl of ramen was around $16 without egg. I thought it was expensive...but its good so maybe its worth it? 

Service - Our host was pretty nice and attentive. Despite the restaurant being busy l, we were still given everything in an orderly manner. 

Overall - Great place if you're a fan of Miso style broth. I heard the other ramen spots might be better if you're not really into miso though!"
Ramen Isshin	4	2020-06-01	Hole in a wall restaurant with phenomenal ramen and shoyu kotteri tsukemen. The servers were fast and incredibly friendly. Highly recommend.
Ramen Isshin	5	2020-03-11	"This is my favourite Ramen place!
As aways they didn't disappoint me. I had the Stone Bowl Shoyu Kotteri Tsukemen and my friend had the Garlic Shoyu Ramen and to finish off I got the Mochi for the first time as a dessert. Stone Bowl Shoyu Kotteri Tsukemen was unique! Its cold noodle and you dip the cold noodle into the hot pot! Highly recommend it!"
Ramen Isshin	5	2020-01-06	"Cozy Ramen place with excellent service! Loved the spicy miso Ramen - I liked how the Ramen was loaded with sprouts, gave it a different feel altogether! Pork was amazing and juicy! I also tried their sake cocktail- I am a sake lover now! 
Definitely visiting again !"
Ramen Isshin	5	2019-12-03	"One of the best ramen around. Expect a wait if you go during peak hours. I went on a Saturday night and waited about 40 minutes. The good thing is you can sign up for the waitlist on Yelp and they'll alert you when a seat will be open soon so you can do other things while you wait.
I got the spicy miso ramen with extra noodles on the side. It wasn't as spicy as I hoped for but I am someone who has a high spice tolerance. It has an even mix of flavours and not too salty as some ramen can be. I definitely will be back to try their other flavours!"
Ramen Isshin	5	2019-11-23	"So many different ramen options to choose from. I chose the spicy white sesame shio ramen and it is unlike any bowl of ramen I have had from any ramen restaurant. It was the perfect amount of spice and didn't taste too salty for me. Our water glasses usually got refilled before it got to the halfway point and we never had to go thirsty waiting for water. 

The Yelp waitlist time estimate is not really accurate and our table for 2 was ready about 6 or 7 places on the waitlist (about 30 min) early. Thankfully the place takes down your name and phone number and will text you a few minutes before your table is ready."
Ramen Isshin	5	2019-11-16	"Reallly enjoyed ramen tonight. Rushed in the last minute before closing at 11pm on a Saturday night. XDXD. So warm in a freezing cold winter day. Missing the time just live next door around Kensington Last year. 
Almost forgot how amazing the soup is, As well as the amazing egg. I have to say, it was one of memorable ramen experiences for a long time!!"
Ramen Isshin	4	2019-11-12	"Delicious, but definitely overrated.

We waited approximately an hour to be seated, so expectations were high at this popular ramen spot that a local friend brought us to.

I got the spicy vegetarian miso, and my friends got the regular spicy miso. It was a pretty good ramen- noodles were chewy and bouncy, and the broth was rounded and a little oily (as ramen should be)- I was very pleasantly surprised that the vegetarian option was not lacking in flavor and didn't feel like a menu afterthought, as often happens in ramen places, where the broth is traditionally pork, something I cannot eat. My friends also agreed that it was pretty good ramen, but we felt that the one hour wait was just not justified."
Ramen Isshin	3	2020-02-16	"I was so excited to come here based on the number of reviews that said this was ""the best ramen in Toronto"". 

I was underwhelmed. The spicy red miso ramen had zero flavor and zero spice. 

Service was great and friendly. I joined the waitlist on Yelp while we were ubering from Union. By the time we got there we waited less than five minutes. 

You just put yourself on the waitlist and once you get there you check in with the host. They text you once your table is ready. Very efficient. 

But yeah. It was ok. I've had better ramen..."
Ramen Isshin	4	2019-10-25	"Ordered some Ramen to go on a cold day. I had the roasted garlic shoyu, and asked for egg on the side (I don't eat eggs!). Let me tell you - this ramen???? DELICIOUS. The broth was creamy, but not too rich, not too salty. It was perfection. Not an overpowering garlic flavour. Roasted garlic has a sweet flavour, but this was a great balance of sweet and savoury. The chashu was okay and much smaller than Sansotei, which I suppose is my only critique, but it's fine. The noodles were delightfully springy.

Highly recommend, was so delicious."
Ramen Isshin	5	2020-02-22	I really love this place, most of their ramens are amazing. The fried chicken for starters are also great. It's super busy during the weekends.
Ramen Isshin	5	2019-10-12	"Good food, great service! 
Went at 6pm on a Wednesday night, no line-ups yet (when we left at 7pm there was a line-up of 8 people at the door). 
Service was so friendly, they checked in often to see how we were doing. 

Very family friendly place as well. Lots of parents bringing their newborn, hence why the noise level is quite loud. But the energy is great."
Ramen Isshin	5	2019-11-03	"I've had Ramen Isshin bookmarked for months now and finally got a chance to try it out this weekend. I had very high expectations for this place, especially since I've been looking forward to it for so long. I'm happy to say that I was not disappointed at all! 

We ordered the white sesame shio ramen and black tan tan noodle because they looked unique. These ended up being excellent choices. The white sesame shio ramen broth was light but had an addictive flavor, I found myself scooping for more and more broth with every bite. The black tan tan noodle broth had a very deep unique flavor, I've never tasted anything quite like this in the past. It is a thicker broth than the white sesame shio. It's so hard to explain the flavors, but I highly recommend both! The noodles and pork were great as well but the broths definitely made a more lasting impression. Oh and the sesame grinding was pretty fun as well.

No complaints with the service or the shop. The staff was nice, food came out promptly, and the shop was clean. We went right when they opened for lunch so we didn't have to wait, but the shop filled up within the first half hour and by the time we left there was a line already. Overall a great ramen shop, I'll definitely be back to try out other items on the menu!"
Ramen Isshin	5	2019-08-22	"This is my favourite ramen place, I never used to like ramen and this was the first place that I genuinely liked and made me change how I felt about ramen. The quality of the broth and the fresh noodles make this place an amazing treat. I've been here a few times and I've never been disappointed.

Started with okonomiyaki and kaarage for appetizers. They were both fresh and a must have !!

I ordered the spicy miso ramen and did not get the extra bowl of noodles but they give you so much noodles you don't even need it! Although I wish this one came with an egg..or should I say half of an egg. 

Overall 10/10 would recommend!!"
Khao San Road	4	2020-05-25	"Covid era ritual pick up order.  I would recommend ordering ahead through the phone or app bc often times there is a line out the door and the last thing u want to do is wait to order and also wait to pick up. The line can get long to pick up the order bc u r waiting in the same line as food delivery workers and it becomes quite unpleasant when the weather gets too cold and windy or rainy.  I noticed there is a price difference between lunch and dinner orders of the same thing. 

Pad see ew is what i only ever get a Thai restaurants. It's probably a solid B, better than most places but not the best I ever had due to it somewhat lacking in taste. 

I added a combo thing to my order which comes with a fresh spring roll which was good and a Tom yam? soup which I tried for the first time and can't say it's for me bc it's spicy and sour. 

Overall, the prices here seem to be on the higher side of Thai restaurants in the area. I would order again on ritual for lunch only."
Khao San Road	4	2020-05-04	"I didn't know how much I was missing until I tried Khao Soi. To be honest, I used to always get green curry when I went to Thai restaurants. One day I tried my friends Khao Soi, and it's now my go to order! I love how you get soft noodles within the curry, and crispy noodles on top. The dish was packed full of flavour and a decent portion size. I'd say it's a bit smaller than the portion at Pai. If you get the dish as take out to eat at home and can't finish the curry, you can save it to eat with rice as another meal!

If you plan to visit later on once things settle, please note that Khao San Road almost always has a line up during dinner time. It wasn't as busy as Pai when I went but don't expect to get a table right away."
Khao San Road	4	2020-03-07	"Still feeling very content from my dinner here last night.. the curry and Thai iced tea were so yummy!! 

I came with a friend on a Friday at 5:30. We were seated right away, having to share a long table with multiple pairs of people. Most of their seating consists of bigger tables so pairs needed to sit with other pairs pretty closely, which can be a bit uncomfortable for some, but as long as the food was good it wasn't an issue for me. 

I order the chicken Khao soi (mild spice) and a thai iced tea. I really enjoyed both. The khao soi was very tasty and flavourful, and the crunch was nice. I was surprised that the curry was pretty spicy though, considering I ordered mild. I was glad I didn't opt for anything spicier or else I probably would have suffered. My advice is to go for a lower level of spice because it is pretty strong, and you can always ask them to add more later. The lady beside me got the same thing but with medium spice and was regretting that decision. The Thai iced tea was the perfect cherry on top to accompany the spicy taste of the curry. Super refreshing and thirst quenching. 

It was notable that the pricing here is a bit steeper than what I'm used to for Thai food, but it's what you can expect when downtown. I'm also still dreaming about that khao soi and Thai iced tea so it was pretty worth it all in all."
Khao San Road	5	2020-05-31	The only qualm I have with KSR is that the delicious food takes awhile to prepare sometimes! I eat primarily vegan meals, and I've always been able to tailor my food to suit my needs and even my peanut-allergic friends can eat safely here. It's a little on the pricy side but the dinner portions are big. Be careful if coming during peak lunch (12-1) - you'll need to be early or go late or give yourself 1.5 hours! Super friendly staff as well
Khao San Road	4	2020-04-27	Khao soi was delicious!! Packaged very neatly and fresh via Ritual. Large portion (ended up saving the soup for 2 more meals!)
Khao San Road	3	2020-01-13	"Well my wife and I finally got around to try the new location of Khao San Road on Charlotte St. I love the decor and design of this location very interesting use of space, at first I thought there was only maybe room for about 20 people but as our server took us around the corner there was more seating for about another 20 to 30 people. The ambiance is really loud here and the back tables are mainly long high tops so plan to share with other people. 

The service is ok nothing too over the top but I give them a benefit of a doubt cause it was lunch time and it was full house and the servers were all running around. It didn't take long to flag our server down for some additional napkins, however our water glasses were empty and no one came around to refill until we asked. 

The food was ok as well we had ordered the Garlic Tofu and Garlic Chicken to start. Both appetizers were very crunchy and crispy the garlic taste was a bit muted in my opinion both also come with a ramekin of the typical Thai sweet chili dipping sauce. Very crunchy exterior which locked in all the juice inside.

I ordered the Pad Gra Prao with beef add $1 and fried egg add $1 which is basically a dry curry with beef, red peppers, onions, red and green chili peppers and also a perfectly cooked sunny side up egg on top of white jasmine rice. I found that the beef was slightly too salty and too dry. Overall 3.5 / 5 for me. 

We also ordered the Khao Soi which is a soup noodle with egg noodles in a curry based soup. We opted to get the beef option for an additional $1. The presentation was really nice flavours were good slightly on the sweet side for my liking but when lime juice is added the flavour sort of balanced itself out. I think this is a 4 / 5 for me.

Overall just another Thai restaurant in the city that serves authentic Thai food. But didn't really blow me away.

FeiJai Out!"
Khao San Road	4	2019-10-26	"Was in Toronto was a business meeting and one of my favorite foods in the city is Thai food. New York doesn't even come close to the amazing quality of Thai food you get here!

I got the Garlic Chicken ($12.50) as appetizers. An absolutely amazing dish and I definitely recommend it. Most tables were ordering it, so you won't go wrong with this one!

For mains, I got the Green Curry with Chicken ($17.50) with a spice level of 3. The spice level was good and my dish had a nice kick to it. The green curry with coconut milk was amazing too!

Service was good and food arrived within 20 minutes of ordering. Music was a little too loud to my liking, but the restaurant realized it eventually and reduced the volume!"
Khao San Road	4	2020-02-22	"I normally go for red curry but decided to try the yellow curry for the first time as it was the special of the day. I loved it, the potato's are a great touch. 

Will definitely be back soon to take advantage of the curry of the day lunch special!"
Khao San Road	4	2019-10-24	"A great spot to check out for Thai food downtown! 
They don't take reservations, so be prepared to wait in line! We came here on a Thursday night around 6:30 and still had a pretty long wait. Thankfully they have a lounge/bar area upstairs where you can wait for your name to be called. 

My usual go-to is the chicken, Pad Thai. Today I decided to go with the Three Flavours Pad Thai with Medium Spice and it hit the spot just right for me. A great addition to this was the Thai Iced Tea! It was brewed so well and had a great creamy texture to it. ( it's also pretty large! definitely worth splitting if you only want a taste of it ) I also had the chance to try my friend's Panang Curry which was so delicious! 

Although we had to wait about 35min for a table for 4 people, I'm glad the service and food was so tasty!"
Khao San Road	3	2019-09-24	"Food 4, 4.5 stars
Not a 5 with the price, average sized portion, about 20 a plate, tad pricey.. place is packed, charge what they want!

ONE STAR for interior; ridiculously loud, annoying.  People hot/sweating, packed everyday, maybe a little AC?
Tight, tight corridors; poor staff, everyone in the way.  Minimal room to maneuver.
Never returning, I'd suggest for those interested; TAKE OUT!"
Khao San Road	4	2019-11-11	"Toronto has some of the best Thai restaurants outside Thailand. I frequent Pai on my visits and only came to Khao San Road on a friend's insistence. And I'm glad I relented. The Khao Soi is insane. I have never tasted better. Just the perfect coconuty and meaty broth with a divine blend of deep fried and steamed noodles. Ohh it was brilliant. 

The Pad Thai was okay. Not bad but nothing to write home about. We walked in at 11.25, right before the restaurant opens. While I did not have to wait, the place was packed by 1145. The service was a little meh. On walking in I wasn't sure if I need to see a hostess, a waitress or just sit anywhere. The girl at the counter saw my party and continued with her paperwork while I stood for an acknowledgment and a seat. My wife had to speak to a waitress to get a table. It was also slightly cold and we asked if they can close the front door. I got a very impolite NO. So started off on the wrong foot but the food more than made up of"
Khao San Road	4	2019-08-25	"Just had a delicious dinner here with friends. I'm usually not a fan of Thai food, but every main we tried here was flavourful and well made. Had the red curry (such a complex sweet-rich curry, top pick!), three flavours pad Thai (great taste), and pad kee mao. We also shared the squash fritters, which were not that special or worth it in my opinion. 

Interior decor is ecclectically colourful and the tables were packed. We arrived at 5:30pm on a Sunday and essentially got the last spot. 

Definitely recommend for a date or get together with friends."
Khao San Road	5	2019-08-13	"I dropped by Khao San Road while visiting Toronto. After seeing all the good reviews it had, I wanted to try it for myself. I got the khao soi and have to say it is the BEST khao soi I've ever had. The curry is well balanced and packs a ton of flavor. Other khao sois I've had have too strong a flavor of fish sauce. The meat is also very tender and breaks apart easily. I love spicy food and most places aren't able to give me the level of heat that I want while cooking the dish so I appreciate that Khao San Road offers a variety of spice levels. I was tempted to try their hottest option but ended up going for Thai level spicy which ended up being the right level of spice for me. 

Prices were pretty standard and I have no complaints about service. I know I'll be dreaming about the khao soi from this place until I have the chance to visit Toronto again."
Khao San Road	5	2019-08-12	"Shared the Squash Fritters (gra bong) with 3 people as appetizers. It was such a perfect start - crispy, fried to perfection, and not oily. The sweet dip enhances the taste and makes you munch on it again and again. For main, I had the Khao Soi, it was absolutely amazing. It's by far the best Khao Soi I've had in Downtown Toronto (I've tried PAI, Sabai Sabai, Sukhothai and Salad King). I love the soup, and the noodles blend perfectly well with it. The overall ambience is trendy and in an elegant, modern setting. There are plenty of seats (has a 2nd floor).

Khao San Road's portions is big - it's around the same price as the other Thai places but leaves you way more satisfied. My recommendation is to avoid the ridiculous line up at PAI and come here instead for equally (if not better) Thai food."
Khao San Road	5	2020-01-10	"It's one of the best Thai places in Toronto and of I'm not mistaken better than Pai... *GASP* But also because they take American Express which means (all major credit cards, which to me seems like it's a dime a dozen these days)

ALSO, their portions are generous and it's worth the money you pay (they are on the more expensive side, but portion size makes up for it).

We ordered:

-Panama curry-- less curry and more of a dry curry type but freaking DELICIOUS 
-fried chicken- can't go wrong
-fried squash- the plate was twice the size of my head

And it was WAY MORE than enough for a large hungry man and my petite self."
Khao San Road	3	2019-10-02	"Spice levels were a bit all over the place. The curry was spicier than the pad thai and chicken kua gling, even though we ordered it with less spice than the others. 

The Thai iced tea was pretty good. Started out a bit syrupy but was perfect once the ice started melting."
Khao San Road	3	2019-06-09	"Hits and misses at one of the most popular Thai spots in the GTA. It's legacy will be for ushering in an era of outstanding and competitive Thai cuisine to Toronto... But as it currently stands, it's good but not worth the long waits.

What We Got: Pad Kee Mao (chicken), Chef Top's Massaman Curry (Tofu), Green Curry (chicken), Thai Iced Tea

What We Liked: 
+curry was smooth and solid kick
+Pad Kee Mao was a big standout - definitely one of my favourite dishes ($17)
+Chicken didn't cost extra but beef did 

What We Didn't: 
-Thai Iced Tea was smooth but missing a ""tea"" flavour, especially as the ice slowly melted. 
-Chef's curry is quite sweet - would recommend only to those who want to mix a sweet tooth with an entree. Also very heavy with plenty of potatoes
-very noisy! Hard to have conversation and hear yourself
-spice levels seemed a bit off. I swear the Pad Kee Mao at level 3 seemed to be more mild than the curry at Level 2. Felt like it was the other way around!


What We Recommend
/Pad Kee Mao! Probably will try level 4 spicy next time, but I might stick with 3 just to doubly confirm next time

Next Time...
Will probably try Pad Thai, Khao Soi and some appetizers. But let's be grateful for all these outstanding Thai options nowadays.


3.5, but I'll wait to round up based on subsequent visits!"
Khao San Road	4	2019-07-25	"Multiple visits in the books even with their old location. Consistent flavours and everything tastes delicious.

Waits time are a bit of a mess here as they only seat complete parties. Dragging on the ""table will be ready in 5"" update for the next 45 minutes is a no.

For those looking to request less ice in their Thai iced tea: it's a smaller cup, but as per staff, equals large cup with regular ice."
Khao San Road	4	2019-06-24	"Khao San Road is one of the better Thai establishment in Toronto. The atmosphere can be a little loud, so it may not the best option if you are seeking a place to chat. There are great vegan options! The restaurant can also make special accommodation if you have a specialty diet. 

Food is fresh and delicious! Most items such as pad thai sam roas ($14.95) with rice noodles, tamarind, tofu, bean sprout, fresh roasted peanuts, dried chili, lime, long leaf cilantro and pad kee mao ($14.95) with wide rice noodles, long green pepper, bamboo shoot, mushroom, thai basil, red bell pepper, faux oyster sauce substitute, soy sauce are made to order. It's great for a quick lunch if you manage to secure a seat. 

Nom! Hot delicious pad thai! Yes! Get in my pad belly now! 

Pro tip: visit right when Khao San Road opens at 11:30 to avoid the wait!"
Khao San Road	3	2019-06-23	"Food: 4/5
Service: 3.5/5
Decor: 3/5
Price: 4/5

Small and quaint. When entering there was a sign warning about bugs that may look like cockroaches inside the restaurant. It says to not be alarmed they are not cockroaches and it is natural during the summer days for these little insects to find their way indoors. If spotted you can call a waiter to come by and they will sweep them up and take them outdoors. 

The menu's are suuuuper dirty. They do not wipe them down at all! There's tons of grit and its sticky on all 3 of our menu's. The pricing wasn't too clearly shown. For the main's its all the same price located at the very top $16.95 and then you can add on your different meats for a dollar or 2 on top. 

We got two appetizers the garlic shrimp and the fried chicken. They were both delicious!. For the mains the green curry was okay, we got it with beef. Big mistake, their beef is extremely tough! it was super dry, felt like it's been cooked for days and kept in the fridge to be warmed up in a microwave and tossed into the curry to serve. The 3 flavours pad thai was good. had a lot of flavour and ingredients as well. The best out of the 3 was the Khao Soi, i got that one with chicken. Delicious. No complaints. 

We let the waitress know about the really tough beef and she just took the dish and brought it to the kitchen without saying a word. After a few minutes she came back and said she would switch the curry to chicken instead. We agreed and she took the plate back inside. It was a pretty busy night so taking awhile for the food to come out is understandable. I shared the Khao Soi and waited for the green curry to come out. By the time we finished our food it finally came. We just asked for it to-go. 

The service i would say is about a 3.5, she seemed as though she was just rushing through everything without talking with the customers. Food took quite a while as well. I would go back to try their other menu items."
Miku	5	2020-05-15	"Been here multiple times 

The staff here is very hospitable.

The aburi is what makes Miku Miku. A process of torching sushi. The ingredients are fresh and the pairing is great. 

I like coming here for their cooked items as well. The dessert is a must !

Shout out to Dan the server for his service and recommendations. Hope to see you soon when restaurants open up again.

I heard they have takeout. I haven't tried it yet."
Miku	5	2020-04-20	"I had Miku as a surprise birthday delivery (shout out to Kathy and Daisy if you're reading this) and loved this.

I got the Aburi Set + Green Tea Opera and was sad to see it disappear in front of my eyes as I took each bite. 

The Aburi set was delicious but honestly, the memorable piece of this whole meal was the Green Tea Opera. I've never had something like it; the base was crispy/flakey, the chocolate was decadent, and the toppings made each bite a well-balanced meal.

If you had to order one thing from here, (yes I know it's a sushi restaurant), I'd actually order the Green Tea Opera over anything else lol."
Miku	5	2020-03-20	"I've tried Miku for the first time in Vancouver for my birthday last year and I loved it! So when winterlicious 2020 came out, it was the perfect time to try their Toronto location. They were fully booked for their dining tables so we had to walk in and sit at the bar/high top tables. We chose to sit at their open kitchen and we quite enjoyed the view of the chefs preparing everyone's food! 

For their winterlicious menu, we had the lunch tasting with an option for appetizer, main and dessert. I chose the sashimi selection with 6 pieces and feature kobachi. My boyfriend chose the Miku Zen - tuna crudo, panko fried scallops, truffle tamari Shoyu chicken, tofu salad. We both just shared our appetizers so we could taste more of their dishes. The sashimi tasted fresh and wonderful and their Miku Zen dishes was a good tasting experience. The ingredients they used blended well all together for each dish and I thoroughly enjoyed it. 

For both our mains we had the Signature Aburi Sushi Plate - Salmon Oshi, Saba Oshi, Coal Harbor roll, Bincho Nigiri, Ebi Nigiri. My favourite piece out of the 5 given was the Ebi Nigiri...my gosh it was the best Ebi nigiri I've ever tasted! It was definitely very different from your usual shrimp nigiris that you would order at regular sushi AYCE restaurants. It melted like butter and the texture was very pleasant. I would for sure reorder it again when I come back to Miku in the future. 

Lastly, for dessert we both ordered their Green Tea Opera dessert. The matcha ice cream was a nice pairing with the cake and I also loved the hazelnut wafer piece to finish it off! The server also recommended tea with the dessert to tie in all the flavours.

As for the service here, it's wonderful! Our server was great and they even have free coat check if there's no room to place your coat. After each course came out, the server also explained the dish and all the ingredients on the plate. 

A great first winterlicious lunch experience at $33 + tax! Hoping they offer a summerlicious tasting menu, but regardless, I would love to come here again in the future."
Miku	4	2020-05-14	We were craving for good sushi during this quarantine and definitely Miku was a great pick! We got the Take platter and there were 36 pieces for 2 people. My boyfriend and I LOVED the torched sushi and the nigiri. The sushi was fresh and super tasty! I would say that the smaller rolls were a little disappointing though and I also found fish bone in one of them. However overall for $39, I would say it is a good cost. I would say that my favorite piece would be the torched salmon and the torched mackerel. I think next time, I want to order just the torched and special pieces more. 10/10 would still recommend!
Miku	3	2020-02-20	"Once upon a time, I was really excited to try Miku when it finally came to Toronto. My friend ended up going before me and loved it, so we decided we would do -licious together. That was a disappointing experience so I never bothered going back. Overrated.  

Fast forward a few years later and I'm back again for winterlicious but now it's $53 for dinner. I have to say Miku is consistent. I felt the same way about the food as I did the first time - mediocre. Expectations were met, but only because I was expecting much to begin with. We were seated near the front and had a view of the kitchen. I was initially shocked by the amount of kitchen staff I saw but I guess that made sense because it's a pretty big restaurant and there was a steady flow of people.   

Signature Sushi Selection (Aburi Salmon Oshi, Aburi Ebi Oshi, Coal Harbour Roll, Red Wave Roll, Aburi Ebi Nigiri and ?) - Pretty cool that you get one of each because on their menu, you can choose only choose one type (nine pieces) for around $18. Unfortunately, the pieces were bland and the rice was a little hard, as if it's been sitting out for a while. When there was flavour, it was just the sauce. The best piece would be the Aburi Ebi Nigiri and the worst were the rolls. Very AYCE tasting tbh. 

Sablefish & Lobster Ravioli - Love sablefish and it's pretty hard to mess up but this was probably the worst sablefish I've ever had. It was much firmer than I'm used to, as in when I smacked it with a fork, it didn't budge. I didn't like the lobster ravioli and there was a piece of shell in the filling. The veggies were flavourless and definitely an afterthought. 

Green Tea Opera - It's a sever layer cake and each layer is different, though it really just tastes like chocolate and red bean. Cool, cool, cool, not important. The best part of this whole meal was the matcha ice cream. The texture was more like gelato imo, super smooth, next to no air pockets, very creamy. Perfect matcha flavour, strong in matcha but not bitter and just slightly sweet. Maybe because I just had it and it's fresh in my memory, but I think this might be the best matcha ice cream I've had. 

Grapefruit Basil Smash ($7) - I liked this. Would describe it as sophisticated grapefruit juice. Stir well before drinking or you wont get the ginger beer/spiced honey part until later. Maybe it's the cup but it was a lot bigger than I thought it'd be. 

No problems with the service. Bonus info, I overheard the table next to us ask the server for their version of a California roll and it sounds like they were able to accommodate."
Miku	4	2020-01-24	"Ya know... My first Miku experience was during the spring on 2017 in Van City...I loved that city so much.  Our dining experience at Miku was the one meal that defined our trip.

Luck has it that Toronto, the sister city, has its own Miku.  Imagine the broad smile that crept on my face as I was researching eating options.

Given we only had a couple of days in the city, we meandered all over.  After a day of seeing Nathan Phillips Square and seeing Scotiabank Arena, we walked a few blocks further to Miku for an early dinner.  Oh, dude... The food was just as good as I remembered!  My fave was the Salmon Oshi Sushi.  We also ordered the Miku Roll.  It's named after the restaurant so it's gotta be good.  We loved everything on our table.  Another yummy meal thanks to the Miku staff."
Miku	5	2020-02-23	"We have been meaning to try Miku. We somehow waited until Winterlicious, we were able to try a lot of items from the menu. 

The presentation and quality of the food was just great. On top of the winterlicious, we got a miso soup each and an extra plate of sashimi. 

Dan from Japan, took care of us that dinner. He is wonderful! Super funny and cheerful, Dan really made our night. Shout out to Dan!"
Miku	2	2020-04-24	Ordered the salmon lover and red tuna maki through Ubereats and unfortunately got food poisoning from my order.
Miku	3	2020-02-19	"Winterlicious Dinner Review $53

Finally got to try Miku for their winterlicious dinner menu. For $53 you got an appetizer, a main and a dessert option.

Sushi Sampler - included some pressed sushi's (shrimp and salmon), two nigiris (shrimp and sea bream), and two pieces of rolls (spicy red tuna and a white tuna one). The sample was decent tasting. My favourites were the two nigiri pieces as they were very fresh and flavorful. The pressed sushi ones were okay as well and provided a more 'fusion' type sushi taste. My least favourite was the rolls. They tasted dry and bland to the point that it was hard to tell what you were sampling. 

Main / Entree: 
Sablefish and Lobster Ravioli with eggplant, mushrooms and romanesco. 

I really enjoyed this entree. I though the sablefish was marinated and cooked perfectly. It was a perfect balance of sweetness and melt in your mouth smoothness. The lobster ravioli and cream sauce was amazing as well. You could really see and taste the quality ingredients that went into the ravioli with lobster meat on every bite. The accompanying vegetables were a little disappointing and very bland tasting. I felt like the romanesco and mushrooms were just blanched with hot water with no seasoning. It didn't really add to the dish, if anything took away from the other two tasty items. 

Dessert: 
Green Tea Opera Cake with Green Tea Gelato

The dessert tasted standard. I heard a lot of great things about this cake and was super excited to try it, but perhaps it was overhyped. I felt the cake part (chocolate ganache) overpowered the green tea flavour as opposed to complimenting it. But, the gelato was very delicious and pungent, which I enjoyed.

The service was great as usual. My only complaint was the fact that the women's bathroom always seems to be in disarray. I think more attention needs to be paid to it for this type of restaurant that thrives in the 'experience'. One stall was broken and there was toilet paper everywhere on the floor. 

Overall, I felt that the food was decent, but perhaps the quality is not as high when it is Winterlicious? Mop"
Miku	5	2020-01-11	"Came here for the first time over a year ago, and came back recently and decided to treat myself to the Miku Kaiseki!! Miku Kaiseki is a five course tasting menu and we got to try everything from the sashimi, appetizers, filet mignon, their iconic aburi oshi sushi, and delightful desserts!!

First of all, their sashimi are so fresh and tasty! Also loved the presentation, they serve the sashimi over ice which was pretty cool and helps keep the sashimi colder.

The appetizers are amazing! Loved the scallop, prawn and oyster. I also NEED to mention how cute the plates they serve the appetizers in. Out of curiosity, we actually asked the server where they got them, and she said that they got it straight from japan which was very cool!

The filet mignon was HEAVENLY. The steak was so tender, it felt like the steak melted in my mouth! The roasted vegetables that were served with the steak tasted amazing with the steak.

Forgot to snap a pic of the aburi sushi, but in my opinion miku has one of the best torched pressed sushi in downtown toronto! Their aburi sushi never dissapoint as they're always top quality.

As for desserts, their signature green tea opera cake was amazing! It has a really nice matcha flavour and i loved the texture!

Service was also amazing, server was very helpful and friendly! All in all, it was an amazing dining experience and i would love to go back and try their other tasting menu!"
Miku	2	2019-12-10	"I wanted sooo badly to love Miku ...Because of the high ratings and I being a major sushi lover, I had very high expectations for this place. My overall experience was extremely underwhelming and disappointing.. The quality of the food is definitely not worth the price.

We ordered the anniversary prix fixe, signature sushi selection platter, beef carpaccio and tuna tartare. The prix fixe was OK.. quantity wise this one is actually worth the price as you get a lot of courses, but only the sashimi stood out as it was delicious and so fresh that it melted in my mouth! The sashimi is my favourite dish out of the ENTIRE meal... none of our other dishes stood out at all.. they did not taste fresh and to be honest, very bland. The beef carpaccio had barely any sauce on it but for some reason, had such a strong and weird after taste that my partner only managed 2 bites LOL. I've dined at many sushi restaurants and have had way better quality and fresh sushi for less than half the price at Miku..

Service was pretty good. Our server was very sweet, made sure our waters were always filled and checked up on us a few times. It was just a bit hard to understand her when she was explaining the food items due to her accent but its not too big of a deal.. 

I don't recommend and don't plan to return to Miku... so much better sushi out there at a far better price."
Miku	5	2020-02-29	"Went here with my boyfriend for a date. They definitely live up to the hype! I got the chef select which comes with 3 small apps, a dessert and a mix of 12 individual sushi, Aburi sushi and roll. The appetizers were amazing! The stewed beef especially, was definitely worth trying. Each sushi piece contained an excellent balance of sauce, fish and rice. My boyfriend got the Salmon Aburi and the MIKU Roll. The MIKU roll was so soft and flavourful (it just melts in your mouth). The dessert that came with the set was a Green tea cake. It was light, flavourful, and a perfect end to our meal. I would definitely recommend getting one of the Chef select combos for a first visit so you can try a bit of everything they have to offer. 

The service was excellent. The waiter took his time explaining all the ingredients in each piece of sushi and gave us great recommendations as it was our first time here. 

It was an amazing experience, would definitely return for casual night out or special occasions!"
Miku	5	2020-02-22	"Food: 
Have dined several times at Miku and the restaurant always delivers on a strong note. Dishes are well presented in a simple and elegant manner, and the desired flavour profiles are never hidden. 

Have ordered the nine piece nigiri plate on several occasions. The paired sauces and garnishes are excellent while each piece is masterfully crafted. Personally, I also enjoy the pressed oyshi sushi, which is torched to caramelize the top layer. The sushi is also layered, which provides an optimal fish to rice ratio and creates a nice harmony of gentle acidity from the rice, fused with umami and sweetness from the fish. 

For dessert, the Green Opera ranks among my favourite, if not, my sole favourite dessert in the city. The dessert features layers of génoise, chocolate ganache, sugar twill, hazelnut wafer, and green tea ice cream. The delectable finish always lives up to its name and provides a memorable experience that can cause even the most stringent calorie counter to transgress.

Atmosphere: 
Very spacious for a Japanese restaurant, which ensures a relatively high level of privacy and consequently is frequented by a more corporate crowd. Decor is as expected and layout of the restaurant offers something for everyone.

Service:
On point and as expected for a restaurant at this price level. Servers are descriptive and articulate in the knowledge of their dishes. Always satisfied with the level of service here."
Miku	5	2019-11-03	"I first found Miku during summerlicious and I must say this is my favourite sushi place in Toronto!! The level of finess and creativity/artistry that goes into Miku's fusion sushi is amazing and honestly better than sushi in Japan. My favourite from Miku is their assorted sushi platter. There are 10 or so carefully crafted rolls with perfect seasoning in each for a burst of flavor in each bite. Their fish are carefully seasoned, and even delicious feel intimidated by raw fish because it doesn't feel fishy... if that makes sense. 

Ever since, I have been back to Miku three times because I just can't get enough! I have tried their calamari, their specialty uni platter, and sashimi. The sashimi is also very high quality, tastes fresh and creamy. 

Another hidden gem is their Momo sake (peach wine). I normally hate the taste of alcoholic drinks but I want to buy 10 bottles of this!! It's very very peachy and so delicious if you like sweet fruits and wines. 

My recommended menu is $38 sushi platter and peach wine if you want to try Miku without killing your wallet!!"
Miku	5	2020-02-12	"Came here for Winterlicious 2020.

I really have to highlight how fantastic the service was! Our server took our plates in a timely manner after we were finished with each course. She also wiped down the table each time! The service was really on point!

We got the Miku zen, sashimi selection, kaisen don, signature aburi sushi plate, green tea opera, and passion fruit soy milk panna cotta. All the food was delicious! 
The Miku zen had a wonderful assortment of items in it! Everything was unique and tasted wonderful on its own. The sashimi also tasted quite fresh and buttery. 
The kaisen don had an absolutely fantastic assortment of sashimi! Every bite was essentially a whole new, delicious taste. The aburi sushi was super unique. Each piece was delicious with very distinguishable flavours.
The desserts were both a wonderful finisher for the meal. The matcha in the green tea opera cake and ice cream was super concentrated. For comparison, it was not as sugary as Tsujiri but similar (if not better) quality. The layers of the green tea opera cake was really something--it had a great mouthfeel! The panna cotta was very light and refreshing as well. 

Fantastic restaurant! I would definitely like to come back again, perhaps for a special occasion, as the prices are quite high. Their quality is definitely worth the decadence."
Miku	4	2020-02-01	"Miku is a stylish and upscale sushi spot near the waterfront great for that special occasion. The place's self-proclaimed specialty is aburi sushi or flame grilled sushi which is indeed the highlight of the sushi menu. They offer a sampler of all the types of aburi sushi, which is 2 pieces each of the three different types of aburi sushi. If you're at all a sushi lover I would highly recommend trying them! The rolls are decent as well, although not particular too remarkable. The sashimi was fresh and presented nicely as well.

you're not a sushi lover, in which case I'd probably recommend going to a different style of Japanese restaurant, but luckily some of their entrees, in particular the sablefish is delicious. 

Overall the restaurant is a nice spot for a fancy sushi occasion in an upscale location. The service was good, and the kitchen staff was actually rather accommodating for dietary restrictions and willing to make changes. However I would say that for the price, even for upscale sushi spots in a city like Toronto, you can probably get a more unique and memorable sushi experience elsewhere, which is what keeps me from giving them one more star."
Miku	5	2020-02-11	"Winterlicious 2020 lunch $33

App: Miku zen (tofu salad, tuna sashimi, fried scallop, truffle chicken) 

Main: Aburi sushi plate (5 psc - aburi salmon, aburi Saba, coal harbour roll, aburi bincho nigiri, aburi ebi) 

Dessert: Green tea opera (cake and ice cream)

I've been to miku many times during the licious season and having tried both the lunch and dinner menu... I MUCH prefer the LUNCH over the dinner.  There are more variety in terms of the apps since I get to try 4 things! On top of that, the dessert is about the same for lunch and dinner. The difference would be portions in terms of main course. For the lunch menu, you only get 5 pieces of sushi which is def not filling for everyone, whereas for dinner you can choose to get the 5 pieces for app and have steak or what not for the main. However, I much prefer the MIKU ZEN for apps and I get a little taste of MIKU's aburi sushi. I came out full tho but I can't speak for everyone since we all eat diff portions.

All courses were fantastic - taste and presentation are ALL on point. However, as mentioned before, portion for the main is small... so not everyone will be able to get full from that. But I was VERY satisfied with all 3 meals and this is why I KEEP coming back to MIKU. 

Staff was friendly and welcoming. I also love the interior design of Miku - very bright and lively! Miku has ALWAYS been my staple in terms of the licious selection across Toronto. Looking forward to summerlicious 2020 at MIKU!!"
Miku	4	2020-02-01	"I've been to Miku many times for work lunches, but this time I popped by for their winterlicious menu  which was $33 for lunch. The items offered were very similar to their regular menu, which makes this one of the better 'licious menus. I ordered the sashimi plate, the aburi, and their signature matcha cake as a dessert. The quality did not differ from their regular service which is always a good sign of consistency. 

I gave it 4 stars because while it was good, it wasn't the best I've had at this price point. However, I would and do continue to come back as it is so central in the city. I definitely would recommend for first timers who don't want to break the bank for good sushi."
Miku	4	2019-10-20	"Really delish sushi but OMG it's expensive.

I love sushi and I always try to find a great deal (not bang for your buck!).

The place truly is stunning and the service is excellent and the sushi is REALLY good but I wouldn't go back because the prices are very steep.
I guess you are paying for the real estate (situated in a beautiful waterfront location).

You can easily walk down the street and find quality sushi thats a fraction of the price. 

I highly recommend going here with a group of friends as this allows you to try and sample lots of different types of sushi, sashimi and other dishes that might seem interesting on the menu.

I had the 'Miki Signature Selection' which is what they are known for (Aburi Oshi)."
Miku	4	2019-08-30	"Miku is an excellent fine dining experience. Everything is immaculate from the food to the service. Plates are cleared promptly, utensils are changed and glasses are always full. 
1) The aburi oshi sushi is a must - i love the salmon. Torched salmon and a jalapeno on top make for a perfect bite. If you haven't had torched sushi before, you must! It'll change your perspective on sushi.
2) And the true showstopper is their DESSERTS! I love the valrhona chocolate cake and the matcha opera cake. Whoever their pastry chef is, is a genius. Everything has the right balance in that it's never too sweet and the flavors are so complex. 

Only one star off because the prices are steep, compared to new spots in the city that are popping up serving torched pressed sushi at better prices. I've been to the sister restaurant in Vancouver and quality is very similar. Great for an occasion like an anniversary."
Jacobs & Co. Steakhouse	5	2020-02-25	"Best steak I've had in Canada and virtually everything else equally good.  Started with their famous Caesar Salad prepared tableside and it was as good as advertised.  The salad had an amazing amount of complexity, especially for a salad.  Very vibrant flavors.  It was also a huge portion.

Followed it with a Wagyu striploin from Sekai Ranch.  I had asked the waiter which Wagyu to go for and he enthusiastically recommended this one, was not at all disappointed.  I have not had much Wagyu so can't say how it compares but overall it was incredible.  A lot of flavor and melted in my mouth.

I also loved the creamed spinach, tasted more like gruyere than spinach, a big plus in my book.  Also had the sautéed onion but that wasn't as great as the other three dishes, not bad (and beautiful presentation) but not awesome.

Also had excellent service, overall a great steak experience."
Jacobs & Co. Steakhouse	4	2020-03-17	"Came here on a Friday night. Not too busy. 

The exterior of the restaurant looks like a huge storage box. Very rectangular. They have valet parking for $20. I think its pretty pricey since parking in dt toronto drops after 6pm, if you want to save some money, look for parking near the area!

Once you walk in, you will see the reception. It was a bit overwhelming for me, the waitress/serves were standing in a straight line, not talking, and looking at you. Felt a bit uncomfortable. Some people may enjoy this kind of service, i just felt like there were just way too many people standing and looking at you. 

We were seated on the second floor. First floor is the bar area and where the pianist performed. 

Second floor decor was very fancy but minimal, love it. We were seated by the window. The server came by, greeted and went over the menu with us. Do not hesitate to ask them if you have any questions, they are more then welcome to assist you and give you suggestions.

We ordered 2 drinks. Both very strong in alcohol flavors and less juicy or soday. Im not much of a drinker, so that was a bit too strong for me.

The bread came after. Huge, fresh, crispy but soft in the side. Looks like a muffin with a huge mushroom head. Love the bread. WISH there was more. 

The salad came after. The caesar salad is made on the spot in front of you. I love the presentation but flavours wise, it tasted a bit too vinegar and lemony to me. Its not bad, but i had better 3/5. 

The steak and the sides came. 

We ordered the 30 days aged striploin from USA in medium. I felt like the exterior of the steak was a bit burnt, made the steak more on the chewy side. I love how they have 6 different condiments for the steak, recommend the soya sauce and the pink salt. Overall 4/5. 

The mushroom risotto smelt super mushroomy and cheesy. Smell and appearance is 5/5. I just wished it was more creamy, the rice was a bit on the chewy side, maybe a minute or 2 longer in the sauce can make it softer and creamer. Still not bad! 4.5/5!

We ordered 2 sides, and the server recommended we do half side, which we did and super grateful because we were so full after. We had the Sauteed Rapini (the green leaves vegetable) and the potato grantin (potato sliced, and layered in cream and cheese). The rapini have some heat to it, its alright, nothing too too special 3/5. The potato was DELICIOUS, if you love cheese and cream, this is the dish for you! Super cheesy, flavourful, cripsy on the top, soft in the inside. 5/5!

Last but not lease, the dessert was a chocolate pudding, whipped cream with crushed chocolate and oeros on the top and bottom. I love dessert but not a fan of desserts that are too sweet. I thought this would be way too sweet for me, but it was in a perfect balance between sweetness and chewiness. LOVE IT! Just wish there was more. 5/5.

They even give you a small chocolate brownie, a cookie and 2 muffins when you ask for the bill. I was too full to even try the muffin. But overall, the experience was great. I just wish the steak was more tender and juicy and the caesar salad can be less sour or vinegary. Overall 8.5/5"
Jacobs & Co. Steakhouse	5	2020-02-15	"Great food and amazing service. Loved every bit of it. 
Patrick (our waiter) made the experience even better. 
Worth every penny!"
Jacobs & Co. Steakhouse	5	2019-11-14	"A fine dining for really good steaks, wonderful service and  exclusive ambiance. 

The servers are knowledgeable and well trained to ensure you have a great experience while you are there. The Sea Food Tower has a nice combination of fresh selections. The Snake River Wagyu is really great! Almost melts in mouth. 

It is at the higher end on price. But the ambiance and quality makes it justifiable. They also have valet parking, which definitely makes life easy."
Jacobs & Co. Steakhouse	4	2019-10-12	"I came here for my birthday celebration. It was a surprise, so I was super excited when we stopped by this place. As we walked in, you walk up a very instagram-able set of stairs. We were greeted promptly, and offered coat-check.

We got a table by the live piano. The piano playing added a nice ambience to our dinner. But I found the piano a little bit too loud at times, so it was hard to hear my date talk. But I did enjoy how he would play to the age group of the crowd. I didn't enjoy my 'sofa seat' that much because it was too low for me to eat properly. It sank in a lot as well. 

Our server explained the menu to us, and recommend that we share a steak and order two to three sides. 

We ordered:
14oz Creekstone Farm Prime Black Angus rib eye - medium rare $91
Table Side Caesar Salad - $26 
Mushroom Risotto - $26
Duck Fat Fries - $17 

Each table started with their house made brioche - which was crispy on the outside and fluffy and hollow on the inside. It also came with their garlic butter, which was buttery goodness. 

Then came the Caesar Salad. The salad was more of a show where the severs would roll a cart of ingredients for the salad to your table and make it in front of you. It was a nice touch to see them make everything from scratch. The salad maker didn't really talk to us or try to make conversation so it was a little disappointing. (I saw the table next to us have a full on conversation with their salad maker).

The salad was good, but not the best caesar salad I ever had. It was a nice balance of cheese, and smoked bacon and a hint of anchovies. If you aren't the biggest fan of anchovies, you can ask for it on the side. I did find it a bit fishy at times. 

Next, came the steak, which was cooked to perfection. I've never had such a tender and perfectly cooked steak. It was charred on the outside on an iron skillet. The steak came with charcoal salt, herbed salt, and pink salt (super fancy). All the salts tasted the same, salty. The steak also came with a chimichurri sauce, blue cheese and yuzu shoyu. I enjoyed the blue cheese the most. The salts and the blue cheese, brought out the beef flavour. Hands down, this is one of the best steaks I've ever had.

The risotto was good as well. My date didn't enjoy it as much, but I didn't mind it. But, if given another opportunity, we probably would have gotten something else.

The duck fat fries were amazing. Who would have thought fries could be cooked this nicely. Every fry had a good ratio of crispiness and fluffiness. The fries came with two sauces, their house ketchup and a garlic mayo. 

We didn't get dessert, but the restaurant gives you a small tasting of their dessert free of charge. We got a small chocolate and a macaron. On the way out, they also give you chocolate muffins as a take-away. This was a nice touch.

Jacob's is definitely a fancier place. From the service, to the ambiance, decorations and even the bathroom, they make sure your visit is enjoyable. The server made sure to check up on us every so often, the water's were always filled, and our napkins were always folded if we left the seat. The elderly gentleman, at the entrance, even insisted in helping me wear my jacket  - even after I refused (I gave in). 

I would like to come back and try their other steaks. There is a Wagyu Steak that costs $880 - out of my price range, but this gives you an idea of the type / quality of steaks they have."
Jacobs & Co. Steakhouse	4	2019-06-13	"Definitely a bougie experience that was unlike any other! Yes, the prices are quite expensive, but the service is phenomenal. We sat in the piano lounge, and were definitely entertained by that night's performer. We were seated in the corner, along the couch - the sofa seats weren't particularly comfortable for dinner (they sank in quite a bit), but it added to the fine-dining atmosphere. The servers were also very kind and accommodated all dietary preferences (we had one vegetarian with us, and they would bring special orders to accommodate his restrictions, such as baguette with balsamic and olive oil to replace the popovers).

Each table is served complimentary popovers, one for each diner, topped with a thin layer of white cheddar cheese and served with roasted garlic butter. These legendary popovers are incredibly airy and light - we had to restrain ourselves from indulging on them in fear of spoiling our appetites for the mains. I preferred the harder shell of the popovers, though the inside is very buttery and rich. The garlic butter is quite flavourful, so take care not to add too much and overpower the bread!

Oyster rockefeller:
My colleague put in an order for this appetizer, thinking they were your normal raw shucked oysters, and couldn't hide his shock when they came topped with a decadent, creamy, cheesy mixture. There was an interesting meatball nestled on top of the sauce. The oysters were quite rich, though I can't say I was the biggest fan.

Caesar salad: 
We then ordered three sets of Jacob's famous caesar salad to be prepared beside the table. I was pleasantly surprised when the server came to the table and asked for everyone's personal preferences for their salad order (e.g., whether cheese or anchovies are okay, etc.). She then made the dressing on the spot - I saw her separate three egg yolks, then whisk thoroughly and combine with freshly cracked pepper, cheese, and a generous amount of olive oil. She then served each plate separately according to our liking - for instance, I didn't want additional cheese but chose to have an anchovy on top. I also noticed that she served me first, likely as I was the only female at the table. 

As it was made in real-time table-side, the Caesar salad was unbelievably fresh. The crunchy, leafy lettuce greens were evenly coated with the creamy dressing. While good, I found the salad to be on the spicy side. The pepper added quite a bit of kick, with a slight bitter aftertaste. The anchovy imparted a pleasant touch of umami, but I thought the bacon was far too salty. There were square chunks of the hard cured meat which, interestingly enough, strongly resembled Chinese cured sausage. 

The mains came next, served with an array of sauces (Argentinian chimichurri, Japanese citrus ponzu, a richer bacon & blue cheese) and salts (sea salt, regular salt, black lava salt). I preferred the ponzu, though the chimichurri was also nice, as well as the variety of salts. It's amazing what a simple seasoning can do to enhance the taste of the steak!

Queensland tenderloin wagyu:
This steak was honestly very tender and super buttery. I barely had to chew; the meat would give to a slight push of my tongue and melt in my mouth. I've had wagyu beef before, but often more thinly sliced and prepared on a Japanese grill. It was my first time with a meaty seared piece prepared medium rare, and it definitely didn't disappoint. Definitely my favourite cute of the night!

Creekstone T-bone:
I didn't have a good experience with this steak. My piece was actually terrible - it was near the edge, and was overcooked to the point where the meat proteins resembled tough pulled brisket. There was also a small amount of fat/gristle that made my mouth seize up. It wasn't a pleasant feeling, and I was very disappointed.

Striploin:
This was a leaner cut of meat compared to the wagyu, though not as tough as the T-bone. Like the others, it was grilled to a perfect medium-rare, with rich and buttery flavours. 

We also ordered a variety of sides to accompany our mains. The duck fat french fried potatoes had a very meaty flavour, and was a great carb to complement our otherwise protein-heavy meal. The mushrooms, carrots, and asparagus were all drenched in butter - this meal was definitely not for the faint-hearted! I was definitely very full and stuffed by the end, and regrettably could not order dessert. 

The bill came with some small shortbread bites, a light sweet to signify the end of meal. We also received some massive breakfast muffins for the next day, a mix of coffee and chocolate filling. The meal was great, but alas, not perfect - perhaps my expectations were too high, but that one steak killed my vibe."
Jacobs & Co. Steakhouse	5	2019-12-22	"Wide range of steaks, that takes your tastebuds for a journey around the world: Japan, US, Australia and even Ontario towns like Uxbridge and Guelph. We dined in the wine cellar, which has a clear wall peaking into the wine cellar and facing opposite their aging room.

First image:
Wagyu (bottom), Guelph (top) with black volcanic salt, miso salt (brown) and sea salt. Each salt had a distinct flavour adding a unique twist to any steak. Sauces were fresh and diverse, chimichurri was my favourite for its fresh ""just picked"" herb taste, Japanese ponzu was a touch too salty, and the Danish blue cheese and bacon (I did not sample)

It's definitely not an everyday dinner, but for a corporate Christmas party or special occasion, Jacobs is a crowd pleasing spot for a delicious meal in a space that encourages learning the story of your meal."
Jacobs & Co. Steakhouse	5	2019-04-15	"Mmmmmmmm no place better to have a steak in Toronto.

I came here for a celebratory dinner and we were put into the private room next to the wine cellar. It was very secluded, quiet and good for bigger groups.

When you're at Jacob's, it's mandatory that you get their Caesar Salad - it's unlike any Caesar salad you've ever had. Nonetheless, the spotlight is on the steaks. I didn't know the differences between them so I had the server help me out. I wasn't disappointed because we ordered 4 different steaks and I could taste the difference in each.

What an extraordinary experience to a carnivorous meal."
Jacobs & Co. Steakhouse	4	2019-03-05	"Dining at Jacobs & Co was on my bucket list for a while so I was ecstatic when my parents made reservations here for my birthday dinner. Off of King on Brant Street, JCS is easily accessible by TTC. If you drive here, you can find some pockets of free parking or pay $20 for valet parking. From the outside, it doesn't look too big, but the restaurant is very spacious with three main dining areas. Service was excellent; the staff here know the menu well and leave nothing to chance. 

Now to the food ...
* Caesar Salad - it's made at your table. I never knew salad making could be an art, but JCS has proven otherwise. The final product was delicious and a 'must' if dining here.
* Mussels - we enjoyed two types.
* Bread - it came before the meal. Think the bread used for bread pudding, but with cheese baked on it. The garlic butter was a nice touch.
* Steak - you can't go wrong. Let your server know your preferences and you'll be directed to a cut that you enjoy. I had the tenderloin from Argentina.
* Lobster Risotto - I broke my 'no rice' rule for this. If I return, I can skip this dish.
* Sides - We ordered mushrooms, rapini and fried potatoes. The fried potatoes were good, but nothing to write home about.

Overall, I had a wonderful dining experience. Hopefully there's something else to celebrate soon so I can return! 

Good for: steak"
Jacobs & Co. Steakhouse	4	2019-09-12	"I'm not a steak person because I always have difficulty digesting beef and I don't like meat with too much fibre. However, my husband is a big eater and a big fan of steak. Therefore we came here to celebrate his birthday with my coworker's strong recommendation. 

Although I purposely ate little for lunch before coming here for dinner, my stomach still felt quite uncomfortable (too full) after dining here. I will still try to write down some fair comments ignoring the uncomfortable part due to my weak stomach.

We ordered the duck fries and Caesar salad as appetizers. The fries tasted awful. Too oily and the oil was too old. However, the Caesar salad had decent portion and flavour too. The server made it from scratch right in front of us. The salad was a little bit on the sour end, my husband didn't enjoy it as much as I did (maybe because he had bad teeth sensitive to sourness lol?). For the steak, I got the 6oz Australian wagyu tenderloin. It was my first wagyu experience and it indeed tasted much softer than normal steak, though not wowed compared to the wagyu I had at other Japanese restaurants later on. My husband ordered the aged 25oz Tbone (yes he just eats that much!) and was very satisfied with the order. I generally don't like aged meat because of the fishy flavour but apparently this place is famous for their aged steak. To be fair, I would recommend anyone who's not against strong flavour of aged meat to give it a try. We also added a bone marrow on the side which was not good.

In general, this restaurant provided decent food with romantic ambiance suitable for special occasion."
Jacobs & Co. Steakhouse	4	2020-01-17	"Steak - Order Wagyu - any other type of steak is just average here. We went for medium rare

Skip the duck fat fries  - less than average 

My husband and I enjoyed the mushroom risotto and their chocolate dessert disappoint

Biggest complaint is that the steaks come out like warm and by the time you finish it, the steaks are cold which is a bummer 

Servers were uber courteous though not friendly....

Pretty good steakhouse but hopefully this isn't the best TO has to offer...search continues"
Jacobs & Co. Steakhouse	5	2019-02-17	"I love this steakhouse! I brought my husband here for his birthday~ I've always wanted to try this restaurant because I've seen people post pictures and it makes my mouth water all the time! 

We ordered the caesar salad as our appetizer to start off with. I find it pretty cool because they prepare it right in front of you at table side. The Caesar salad is nice and light! The sauce is just right! A teensy bit pricey for a Caesar salad - but worth it!
We ordered the snake river farms wagyu - USA, 10 oz tenderloin and the 8 oz A5 black tajima- gunma prefecture - Japan California cut striploin. 

The A5 black tajima was AMAZING!  A well marbled steak with rich buttery taste and texture - melts in the mouth! The best steak I've had so far in Toronto! 

The snake river farms was good as well! But not as good as the A5 black tajima. The meat was tender and perfectly cooked at medium rare. 

Overall, this restaurant was a great experience! The service was great, the setting and ambience were perfect. They even give you a muffin to go home with! I had it for breakfast the next day . It is a little bit on the pricier side, but totally worth it!"
Jacobs & Co. Steakhouse	4	2019-02-17	"Finally had the opportunity to come here after hearing all the great things about this place. Very upscale and posh vibe. 

Servers were descriptive with the menu and was very at tentative. Made great recommendations.

Oysters tasted fresh. Table side Cesar salad was great. Ribeye was well cooked but still tough and chewy. Wasn't particularly well seasoned which is why the side salt and sauces were provided. Could have lived without the rapini and mushroom. Bone marrow is a must. 

Independently a very great experience but tainted from just coming back from Japan."
Jacobs & Co. Steakhouse	4	2019-10-07	"A wonderful evening spent with the love of my life celebrating our one year anniversary which later converted to our engagement!

The surloin and toploin steak is definitely excellent, when you choose the right cut! The sides offered are also huge so beware when you order. The baked potato is especially large!

Service by staff is very good and the the only comment I'd make is about the cooling in summer as it felt rather stuffy inside.

Highly recommend for a special occasion!"

Hi and welcome to another episode of javing it with Javier. Let's see what we are javing today. To celebrate starting my new job my friend Daniel offered to take me out to a restaurant of my choosing. Obviously I had to choose Jacobs as I've been dying to try it after hearing it is arguably the best steakhouse in Toronto. 

To start, we had the salad with crispy bacon and cheese topped off with an anchovie. The waiter made the salad right in front of us so it was an interesting watch. Then came the main course. We ordered the A5 Black Kagoshima striploin from Japan, the Canadian Prime High River Ribeye, the duck fat fries, and the creamed spinach. I have had Kobe steak in the past and that blew my mind. Although my mind was not blown to the same extent, I was delightfully surprised. The feeling of the melting fat harmonized itself perfectly with the taste of the beef. The 20oz ribeye was huge and was packed with juice. The fries and creamed spinach were also very good but my stomach was focused on the steaks. 

The service here was unrivaled. The quality of service was equivalent to the time I tried out a three Michelin star restaurant during my China trip. The waiters were very friendly, helpful, and cleaned our table after every dish.

Just walking into the place I could feel how fancy it was. From the candle lit atmosphere, to the soft live performing pianoist in the background. I was almost going to pick my daily T-shirt with sweater combo when I was getting dressed in the morning. Good thing I wore something slightly fancier!

Although I really enjoyed my night and I would term this as a once in a lifetime experience, the cost of the meal was on the high side costing us a total of $520. Good thing papa Daniel got this one covered :P

In conclusion, I think this is the first review I gave a perfect score on. I would definitely go again but maybe for a very special occasion. I know the Japanese beef will be waiting for me. And that's it for today's episode of javing it with Javier. And remember food is life!"
Jacobs & Co. Steakhouse	5	2019-03-15	"I'm starting to notice a common trend among the top tier restaurants in the city. Not only do they serve incredible food, I'm realizing that the service they provide, just like their food, is top notch!

Came here for a birthday dinner and I have to say that the experience was excellent. I must warn that the bill can run up pretty quickly, but it's a definite try for a special occasion. 

Our server was very professional who has been with the restaurant for 5 years. He was very generous and honest with us about not needing to order too much because portions were very sizeable and shareable. I wish I could remember his name, huge props to him. 

We started with the table side Caesar, that is a must get. Got to pick the servers brain a little as well about what goes in to making a good Caesar. Very friendly with lots of Tips! Btw Don't use too much cheese, it will be bitter if you do. 

We also got Canadian Wagyu which is seasonal from my understanding, who knew Canada had wagyu beef? We also ordered black angus from California. For sides we got bone marrow and also mashed potato. Impressed by how much flavour was in both of these sides as well, great quality. 

The steaks were cooked to perfection with a whole lot of beefy taste to it. The crust on these things were incredible as well. I'd highly recommend the Canadian wagyu, full of beefy notes but also soft and tender when you bite in to it. Definitely worth the price! 

I look forward to the next time i have an opportunity to dine at Jacobs!"
Jacobs & Co. Steakhouse	4	2019-01-05	"When going to Jacobs, you know you'll be getting the finest cuts of steak in town, attentive service, and a memorable experience. I can't say this second visit to Jacobs offered all of that. 

PEI oysters: Great to start with - accompanied with hot sauce (not seafood sauce), black vinegar, and fresh horseradish. Fresh and high quality

Steaks: Very glad that our waiter was open to serving a Chicago style blue rare steak, which was finely executed (minus whoever cut open the steak to check how well it was cooked). The 45 day dry aged striploin was marvellous, perfectly and evenly cooked as expected. The waiter explained all steaks in good detail and helped us make a decision. 

To finish: Without reminding them that we were celebrating a birthday, they decorated our dessert with was very thoughtful! Delicious muffins are given to take home, and small chocolates to end the meal. 

The negative: Personally I did not like our waiter who seemed very ""pushy"". He would recommend drinks and desserts before we asked for recommendations, and made it very awkward to choose otherwise. Also he rarely made visits to our table, taking away from the experience.  

Overall the ambiance is great, food is perfect, but service is not as professional as I would expect from one of the finest steakhouses in Canada."
Jacobs & Co. Steakhouse	5	2019-07-21	"Birthday dinner for 10
Superb wine service with Riedel somm stems to accompany the top shelf wine we brought.

From their signature bread & the seafood tower to the risotto & steaks -including Aussie wagyu - everything was  perfect. We also ordered bone marrow and the must have Caesar salad. One of the tenderloins ordered was done medium, no problem, they replaced it and the medium steak was packed up in a doggy bag.

The seating area for 10 was also nice in a sequestered space with windows on both sides at a roundtable on the main floor. 

A dining companion commented on dark chocolate pairing well with a bottle and it was taken care of.

Stayed there well past closing time and we were not feeling rushed in anyway. 

I think this place is better suited for larger groups of 6-8 at least and no bigger than 10. There's a rectangular private dining area downstairs but you end up chatting with folks next to you given the size of the table.

Overall it came to around 450$ with tip and corkage (approx 2 bottles) per person, but was well worth it for a special occasion."
Jacobs & Co. Steakhouse	4	2019-06-26	"Visited as a solo for a splurge dinner! Sat at the bar with the oyster station. Atmosphere was ok, food was good, service was great.

I kind of wish I sat at the bar I walked thru since there was live piano. Where I sat felt more like an upscale pub. Nothing wrong, but nothing tantalizing either. At the end of my meal there was a couple who joined and were the most obnoxious people...the woman behaved as though the entire bar was her living room. Perfect signal to wrap up my dinner and jet out!

Ordered a Caesar salad and an Australian steak that's the same breed as Kobe/wagyu but not raised in Japan. Caesar is made tableside. Enjoyed chatting with the server who was making it for me. The salad was good, but overly garlicky for me. I requested a palette cleanser afterwards as I was worried the garlic fire breath I had would distract from my steak! On a side...I breathed garlic all night even after brushing and swashing and taking a zantac antiacid and woke up with garlic breath the next morning! Tooo much garlic!

Steak came out cooked perfectly...medium rare. It was tasty, but it wasn't distinct enough that I would try it again because it was just Such an indulgence. The next time I would bite the bullet and order the authentic A5 Kobe wagyu steak.

Service was excellent. The waitress was knowledgeable, and answered all of my questions thoroughly. She patiently made excellent recommendations for wine...a white and a red for both courses in my meal. They were also able to offer 3 oz pours so I didn't need to have 2 full glasses of wine...which I did not want. 

Dessert was a cheesecake which was an average  cheesecake and they were generous about addressing that. Cappuccino was good, but not strong or concentrated. This course was not steakhouse quality, but rather something I'd expect at a nice diner. 

I wouldn't hesitate coming here again, but I felt in some areas it was more pretense than substance. I've eaten at Michelin star restaurants and Every part of the experience is excellent. Here it was good, but kind of spotty at times. Not worth the $300 price tag IMHO.

Thanks Jacobs staff for taking the time to walk me through your menu and help me narrow down the best steak for me. I appreciated the excellent service and hope to try another room and another steak when I'm back in Toronto in the future."
Jacobs & Co. Steakhouse	5	2018-11-30	"Wow, what an experience this was. My boyfriend and I went here for our anniversary dinner and we were not disappointed. The place itself is beautiful with big and tall doors to greet you, it was a grand experience and made me feel important.

Once we were seated, we knew we had to get the table side Caesar Salad. While we were waiting for it to be made, they gave us 2 popovers with an herb butter which was tasty.  A server came by to make the dressing from scratch! Anchovies, raw egg yolk, garlic, and fresh parmesan cheese. It was cool to see them make it in a big wooden bowl. It was also served with crispy panchetta and complimentary white anchovies on our salads. This Caesar salad is the best I've ever had.

My boyfriend and I got the beef tartare for an appetizer. It was done so well that other beef tartares can't compare for my boyfriend. It was his first impression of beef tartare! I've had my fair share and I would have to agree.

We got the striploin that was aged 45 days and tbh I'm drooling a little bit as I'm writing this review. It was cooked to perfection, medium rare is what we like and that's what we got. Perfectly charred on the outside. For our side we got the potato gratin which was super tasty with all the melty cheese and creamy potatoes. They baked it which made the cheese that much better.

I told my boyfriend that it is a once a year treat but honestly I think I have to go back ASAP. Such an amazing dining experience."
Swatow Restaurant	5	2020-05-19	"[Review was based on experience weeks ago]

This place is one of the first locations I have ever bookmarked on Yelp when I started my journey here. One time, my coworker asked me if there were any good places to eat for Chinese food and I remembered the amount of good reviews for this place and so I told him about it even though I did not have it yet. He told me the next day that he loved it! 

After about 4 years of this sitting in my bookmarks, it was time to try it out. It was busy during the time we went and so that fueled our appetites even more. We got the beef ho fun, wonton soup and shrimp fried rice. I was actually amazed because the food came out relatively fast and that it was sooooo yummy. I usually do not eat Chinese food outside but this one is 100% an exception. Good portions with also good prices, indeed. I would totally come back to eat the same delicious dishes again. I am salivating as I look back at these photos...."
Swatow Restaurant	5	2020-03-11	"Swatow is a really good Chinese restaurant that I always go after studying in library they speak Cantonese and I love to talk to them in canto too! Much more fun that way! 
And their servings are always pretty big but sometimes could be a bit oily(well, Chinese food XD)
But it opened till very late(around 11pm I think?) so it's always suitable for ppl getting hungry late!"
Swatow Restaurant	4	2020-03-06	"The portions are huge. The place is in chinatown and is always busy. The food is your typical yummy, greasy, Chinese food. 

We had the chicken fried rice and the shrimp noodles. Everything tasted really good"
Swatow Restaurant	3	2020-01-25	"Decent chinese food place

Inside is pretty packed. Our table was next to the washroom lol

The food is authentic. The portions are decent. Price is low, even when compared to similar restaurants in the area.

Cleanliness is ok. Staff friendliness is ok. They make jokes with customers. Overall a friendly environment.

Pretty decent place for chinese food. Will come back!"
Swatow Restaurant	5	2020-02-19	"This places is always busy and we finally had a chance to stop by without a wait. 

This is very traditional home style noodle soup style. I thought that it was very reasonably priced and generous portioned. They have various different types of noodles: egg thin noodles, egg flat noodles, rice vermicelli, rice flat noodles, etc. These are available to mix and match with your choice of soup from the menu. 

It's worth trying, especially on a cold winter day. We'll be back whenever we have cash (as this is cash only)."
Swatow Restaurant	4	2020-02-29	"Love myself some late night greasy Chinese food. A typical visit that will include the fried rice, beef noodles, meat dishes and stir fried veggies.

Their hot and sour soup was a little concerning though. It was more red as opposed to the typical brownish colour. There was no balance between the hot and sour - it was just sour. The only dish I would say to stay away from.

Cash only establishment."
Swatow Restaurant	3	2019-11-24	"Clearly this place is very popular because there was a line out the door during prime time dinner. This disappointing part is the table set up. It's so packed. We couldn't get to our table without telling like two tables if they can move. In addition, we were very confused about the food options. We had to send our noodles back because it's not what we wanted. I asked to double check before that could happen  but I guess there was a miscommunication. Also i was not a fan of the chicken we ate. Tasted mainly like a lot of fat and breading. The second  pair of noodles we got were very delicious.
Overall I'm not the biggest fan of the service and the food. Except the Lo MEIN, those were good
Menu:
General Tao Chicken
Lo Mein Beef and Vegetables"
Swatow Restaurant	3	2019-08-22	"The food here is amazing. I understand why previous reviews mentioned it being an OG spot and authentic taste overall. They specialized in more FuZhou cooking but it's good cause it doesn't have the oily and greasy taste afterwards. We enjoyed everything we ordered and the portions were a great size for what we needed that day. They cook really good snow pea leaves, probably one of the best I've had in Chinese restaurants. So definitely no complaints about the food at all, it's totally worth it but CASH ONLY! 

The only reason why I'm giving it a 3 is because they don't have the best table service (which seemed to be the case in the Toronto Chinatown area). The waiting staff look really annoyed at you and the lack of hospitality is not what I'm used to when I go to restaurants. Maybe the workers are being overworked and not compensated enough, just don't let it rub you the wrong way if you want to try the food, it does come out fast and I did really enjoy it."
Swatow Restaurant	4	2019-09-29	"A classic Hong Kong style Chinese restaurant that opens til late, late at night in Chinatown. It might be open even when Google Maps says it's closed. And one very great thing about this place is its speed. The food is delivered within a few minutes from ordering most of the time.

I come here when ever I just want some Chinese comfort food or when every where else is closed. Their congee is usually good, not perfect, but its thick and creamy. Their beef brisket and tendons are usually on point, super tender and tasty. Their beef and bitter melon on rice is good with a bowl of rice. The sauce is a bit salty, probably expecting you to eat it with bland rice, but the bitter melon is cook quite well. Bitter melon is not for every one though because it is quite bitter. And the stir-fried pea tips are excellent too; it's a bit oily, but it tastes great with the oil. And the stir-fried rice noodles with beef is also nice; it's also very oily, but it tastes nice. I also love their clams with black bean sauce. There is a generous amount, and the sauce isn't either too starchy or watery. 

Overall, I'd recommend coming here to get some classic Hong Kong style stir fries or beef brisket and tendons with noodles or rice."
Swatow Restaurant	4	2019-08-06	"Swatow is an old school Chinese restaurant located in downtown Chinatown. It's been around for many years and have always been my go to stir fry noodles, soup noodles and various stir fried dishes that meets variety of tastebuds. My usual favorite is the beef brisket noodle soup along with their stir fried clams in black bean sauce. 

This visit ordered the stir fried beef and vegetable noodles, beef brisket rice and fried tofu. All dishes tasty as usual. The fried tofu is a great value at $0.99 each and is fried crispy. A must especially if you can handle chili sauce to pair with it. Beef brisket dish was very saucy but meat usually more soft. Must be a off day. 

Overall I'm always very satisfied with the food here. Customer service and cleanliness obviously not expected here but service is lightning quick as tables are turned over very fast. Opens late into the morning so anyone that craves for a late night snack can definitely come here."
Swatow Restaurant	4	2019-09-02	"The restaurant is one of the older ones located in Chinatown. It was packed when I entered the restaurant. The restaurant itself is very limited in its seating, so in order to seat as many people as possible, I noticed the servers placing two different parties at one big table. 

I ordered Beef Tripe Noodle Soup and my sister ordered the Wonton Noodle Soup. The noodle soup are filling in my opinion and definitely worth its value (under $5 without tax!). I tried both noodle soup and I preferred mine over my sister's. The tripe was so soft and chewy. As well, I liked the meat broth taste - a bit less bland. I also ordered the stir fried clams in black bean sauce and they were very delicious. I never thought of the combo of black bean sauce and clams, but they complemented well and a definite must-try if you like clams. I recommend this restaurant- definitely worth the money for their food. 

However, disclaimer is that they ONLY ACCEPT CASH."
Swatow Restaurant	4	2019-07-22	"Noods, noods, noods! Swatow has all the noodle options and you can't go wrong with any!

Tried the egg noodles with shrimp wontons and shrimp dumplings. The noodles are chewy, the soup comes out hot and the veggies are cooked to perfection. The wontons are a must!

The majority of the tables were taken the few times we popped in. There's a wait if you don't want a shared table, but doesn't take more than a few minutes since most seem to be in and out and they're very quick with service."
Swatow Restaurant	5	2019-10-21	"And still and absolute belter of a Chinese, the best beef in black bean sauce in the city!

I always intend to try something new but always end up with this and shrimp fried rice - great comfort food."
Swatow Restaurant	5	2019-12-28	Stopped by this restaurant with my parents for nostalgic reasons. They both raved about it being the best place for noodles since they were in high school. They said it's one of the few places that had authentic Shantou noodles. So we tried the noodles with fish slices, fish balls, and beef brisket. The noodles instantly reminded me of the ones I had in Chiuchow and Shantou, which I still dream about. The broth was light, the noodles were cooked firm, and the fish balls were flavourful. The beef brisket was tender and juicy. Although these noodles can't exactly replicate my experience back in China, it did hit the mark! After finishing our noodle bowls, we also took out some fish balls to cook at home. It was such a satisfying and comforting meal. Looking forward to coming back for more noodles!
Swatow Restaurant	4	2019-08-26	"Famous Noodle and chinese dishes place located china town of Toronto. Food are prepared authentic way and ingredients are fresh. Good portion dishes. Just the restaurant is not big and crowded, because it's always lots of customers. Their famous food is 汕頭魚蛋粉 Shantou style fish ball noodles  and l saw lots of customers order deep fried chicken wings, looks great too! I will try on my next visit  recommended 

Open till 1am, good choice for late night craving"
Swatow Restaurant	4	2020-01-07	"If you haven't heard of Swatow or haven't been yet you totally should. While not totally vegan this is another location in Toronto where you can get some Chinese style food that is vegan. The portions are huge and it's very inexpensive for what you get and it will not disappoint your taste buds.

Be prepared to wait a bit to get in. This is a very small place and can be very busy especially during standard meal hours. The staff were friendly and super accommodating to us. They mainly have small tables but there are a few bigger ones. If you have a fairly large group of say more than 5 people you might want to reconsider if you all want to eat at once and sit together. This is great for small groups or even the solo diner. It was actually so busy when we went that we wound up sitting at a bigger table with other diners which was a lot of fun actually. 

No matter the shortcomings of this establishment once you try the food it will all melt away and you'll actually wonder if it even matters. Just go I doubt it you'll walk away without wanting to come back."
Swatow Restaurant	3	2019-08-03	"One of the OG restaurants of Toronto's Chinatown. It is a classic ""hole in the wall"" that has stood the test of time. The surrounding area is slowly but surely undergoing gentrification.  I remember a lot more Chinese supermarkets and aunties selling vegetables and other items along the streets. 

The restaurant is small and cramped. If you have a seat near the kitchen doors, be prepared for the stench every time the door swings open. You don't come here for the ambiance/service. You come here for Chinese food. 

Washrooms are in the basement, as with most restaurants in the area. 

Service is as expected from a Chinese restaurant. Effective. 

Ordered:
""Fish sliced noodle soup"": I chose vermicelli, which is thin rice noodles. The ""fish sliced"" is actually a blend of mystery fish made into a cube pre-cooked and sliced. It's probably the same item used for hotpot. Instead of this topping, I'd recommend the fish balls (you really taste the ""fishiness""). 

The soup is clear and very mild in flavour. It's not overly salty. A plus is the vegetables that accompany the soup. 

Observing the other tables' chow meins, rice dishes etc., I believe Markham Chinese food / Congee Queens provide much better value (quantity:price ratio)"
Swatow Restaurant	5	2019-12-11	Toronto has a Chinatown, bakeries, small businesses, restaurants and more. Always ask locals for recommendations and our Lyft driver lead us to Swatow. This authentic Chinese cuisine was great. We had a wait ( don't arrive hungry), and we ordered enough food for the two of us, the table next to us had a 7 person group, the more the merrier aka try more menu options. The clams in black bean sauce were my favorite.
Swatow Restaurant	4	2019-06-14	"Toronto has an authentic Chinatown. Though not quite as vibrant as San Francisco or New York, we found a very good place to eat. 

The won ton soup was plentiful and filled with fresh bok choy and too many noodles to eat. Three of us shared this. Then we had the general tao chicken which was tasty but not overly spicy. And had a sliced beef over rice dish which was also flavorful. 

All in all much better than we can get in Detroit. We enjoyed the meal and would come back but wouldn't feel like we had to come back."
Swatow Restaurant	5	2020-01-05	"Definitely one of my favourite places to go for some quick, cheap eats

I got the Shrimp wonton noodle soup for about $7.
Broth is not too greasy, tasty and came with 5 wontons and some veggies

Ambiance was just like any hole in the wall Chinese restaurant

Service was just like any other Chinese place, non-existent but understandable. You write down your order on a sheet of paper and after the waitress gives you a meal, they leave you alone. After they see you're almost done, they'll give you the bill with 2 fortune cookies. Just a heads up, they also only take cash."
DaiLo	5	2020-02-04	"Service: Excellent. We were greeted and taken to our table,  where we were offered coat check,  which is a nice touch,  especially in winter!

Our server is a legit sommelier, which made her wine recommendations fantastic and trustworthy.  

Highly recommended reservations for this place.  We had a 6pm reservation and the next party, wasn't coming until 830, which gave us plenty of time to talk and enjoy the food. 

Food: tasty! We ordered the sweet n sour pork hoc , which was soft and easy to eat.  Im not a fan of eating fat,  but this I thoroughly enjoyed.  

We also had the deep fried trout and octopus tacos.  Both very good. 

The desserts however,  I found too sweet.  We had the date cake and chocolate chomparado. 

Food came out quickly which was nice too :)"
DaiLo	4	2020-01-07	"DaiLo was recommended to me by a Toronto local and albeit the pricey small portions, I'm glad I gave this place a try. I mean...truffled fried rice, brown butter potato dumplings, octopus/pork belly daikon tacos?? This place knows how to elevate Asian flavors!!

The above were my favorite dishes that we tried but along with those, we also had the pork wontons and the brussel sprouts. I am a HUGE brussel sprout fan and loved this dish but found it quite interesting to be topped with shrimp floss and smoked trout.

Definitely make a reservation here if you go! We got here at 5:30pm right when they opened and seats were already limited."
DaiLo	3	2019-12-27	"Small portions, and flavors weren't very exciting for ""upscale fusion"". Seemed pretty typical Asian.

Staff was good and attentive.

All in all the atmosphere and experience felt very pretentious."
DaiLo	4	2019-11-26	"We came here for a date night and was blown away by the service and the food. I walked in thinking it was just every Asian fusion tapas restaurant but was pleasantly surprised with each dish.

To keep things interesting, we had the tasting menu and had dishes that weren't on the menu like the Big Mac Bao - which was delicious and you know, tasted like a Big Mac with that sauce.

My favorites of the night were the Hakka Wontons, Ontario Pea Dumplings and oddly enough, the corn soup starter they gave us to kick off the meal. 

I was completely stuffed at the end until the manager came over and served us a White Rabbit Ice Cream in basically a bowl of chocolate goodness. I will actually come back just for that dessert if it was on the menu - I was mind blown.

The only thing I would change is that instead of ordering the Giggling Trout, get the Duck instead."
DaiLo	3	2019-09-23	"Good food and unique flavours but found it a bit pricey for whats it worth. Came here on a Sunday evening to a somewhat empty restaurant that filled up slowly throughout the night. Dishes were flavourful but expensive. The portions are also quite small so if you want to fill up, you'll need to spend quite a bit. I may personally struggle a bit with fusion Chinese restaurants as I often find similarily tasty food for significantly cheaper in traditional restaurants. 

Worth a try but I won't be a regular!"
DaiLo	4	2019-07-26	"Chef Nick Liu is a staple here, and he and the staff helped to seat us as they opened the restaurant. Now that is what you call service. 

My wife and I, as well as my brother brought my dad out for a belated father's day as he wasn't feeling well the week of. 

We tried to be a mix of adventurous as well as somewhat safe to see if I couldn't get my dad to enjoy the meal: mission was a minor fail

We started with the Fried Watermelon. It was a weird and interesting experience for the table. The warm juiciness of the watermelon against the herby basic and acidity of the pickle and the porkfloss added some salt a difference in texture. This was a fun dish that played with the temperature, and different flavours.

The Burmese Tofu arrived around the same time. The chickpea texture stands out in this tofu and really fits with the spicy mixture of the duxelle and chili. This mixes that familiar tangy-spicy mixture you'd be used to in other Asian dishes with a different take on a tofu. It was quite enjoyable, heat levels would not be appropriate for those who are spice aversion.

Our Third Starter was the. Ontario Pea Dumplings. I enjoyed the duality of the mush pea filling of the dumpling and the springy full pea that decorated the dish. I'm not sure I'm a huge fan of the truffle here. I feel like it takes a bit away from the peas but it added a punchy earthiness to the overall dish a long with the other mushrooms. 

We ordered the Truffle Fried Rice and Jackfruit & Chili Glazed Back Ribs.
The rice was your standard friend rice but with that punch of truffle, its not as strong as I've had with other fried rices with truffle. The ribs were tender and fall off the bone. Its not sweet or spicy in any regards but still tasty all the same. 

The chef sent out palate cleansers, in the form of sorbets. I forget the flavour.

We also got the Soju Poached Pear for dessert. The pear retains that bite in the texture while being tender enough to cut through with a spoon. The nuts and the ice cream help to round out the dish emphasizing the sweetness and the crunch of the dish. 

I would love to explore the menu again or to try the tasting menu. I enjoy the difference that is represented in Chef Liu's dishes and can't wait to try more."
DaiLo	3	2019-11-23	"Very pricey very small portions but good atmosphere, services is pretentious but ok. Good place for drinks and what feels like tapas.  Good place for an expensive date, most plates enough for 2 ppl only. 

Plates to try: fried rice, whole fried fish, jelly slaw, 

Plates to skip: fried watermelon sound cool but just warm cubes of water lemon, ribeye (meat was tough), duck meat was also tough, 

We ordered 3/4 of their small menu. They don't have all the items pictures on yelp. 

They have an excellent bottle of white wine, Chasselas I think from France? Yum. 

BEWARE: we found that the prices they charged on our bill was different and higher than the prices listed on their menu ??!! Shady right??! How does that even happen?? Our bottle of wine was listed for $75 and they charged $85 and a few other other items too, $38 listed charged $40 etc.  We verified the wine and they admitted their fault.  We let the other smaller differences go but SHADY BUSINESS PRACTICE OR INCOMPETENCE?! 

Just REMEMBER TO CHECK AND DOUBLE CHECK YOUR BILL. ITS SO EXPENSIVE ALEADY so I guess most people just assumed it was accurate."
DaiLo	4	2019-05-27	"Where do I start with this place. It's Asian fusion done really well. My friends and I booked a table here way in advance. We came here for dinner on a Saturday night and it was complete packed. We ordered the fried watermelon, lobster over a bed of noodles, truffle fried rice and duck over dark blue pottato salad.

Food here is pricey, but the portions and service here is great. We literally devoured everything off our plate. The breading on the watermelon and the soft texture inside is a must try. The ginger scallion lobster over some fried noodles provided a nice crunch. The duck was cooked perfected all the fresh veggies played by it complimented the dish very well.

Overall the food was really good. 4 entrees was plenty for 4 people. I'd highly recommend what dishes are specials and off menu. The lobster was not on the menu but we'll worth it"
DaiLo	2	2019-09-06	"2.5 stars. Nice casual ambiance. The tasting menu is around $190 for two, after tax and tip. I was let down by the food. They have a tendency of using very strong flavours that were overwhelming and competing with each other.

For instance, the pea dumpling had black truffle, bone marrow, and bacon. I wish I could have tasted the pea filling and bone marrow more because that was quite delicious, but it was overpowered by the more dominant flavours.

The wontons in sweet chili sauce was my least favourite dish. It was way too sweet (desensitized my tasting buds for the next dish), and the wonton wrappers mushy and falling apart.

The tacos were doused in aioli and it made the whole thing just taste like spicy mayo.

The fresh leaf wrap was very good and texturally interesting.

I didn't think the tofu ""cheese"" Caprese salad was anything special, but the tomatos were nicely peeled to soak in the dashi.

The smoked duck is a smart menu item because it can be prepared ahead of time and has a longer shelf life, can be served cold (well it was served cold to us so I assume that's intentional). The downside is that the fat is not rendered at all. and cold duck fat can be very rubbery. The skin was also unpleasant. It was not similar to a duck prosciutto where the fat is tasty and thinly sliced. The purple potato mash was very boring.

The ""famous fried rice"" tasted purely of black truffle oil, so if you like truffle you'll enjoy this. Thankfully there were no other competing flavous. I didn't think it was special. I think dousing things in truffle oil is a bit of a copout.

Our server was very nice, but he was quite busy. We had to wait a long time for water sometimes, and the sparking water cups are so tiny that I was constantly running out. No  pitcher or bottle for the table. Time between dishes is also long.

Overall I don't regret coming here, but I'm not sure if I'd come back. The value for the quality of food was not worth it for me. It certainly was interesting to try once."
DaiLo	2	2019-04-23	"One of the few restaurants I was most excited for but was left the most disappointed... Based on the reviews and pictures I came here with high expectations, unfortunately my experience was very underwhelming.

My friends and I ordered the crispy octopus tacos, hakka brown wontons, torched tamari glazed beef carpaccio, sichuan braised beef and the whole fried giggie trout. My table all agreed that the tacos were delicious and the best out of everything, and since this was the first dish brought to us we had very high hopes for the rest of our dinner. 

The rest of our food were just mediocre - it wasn't BAD but it wasn't to die for either. It honestly tasted like stuff we can make at home, which some people may not mind but my friends and I were expecting the fusion tastes to be more noticeable and long the lines of tastes we've never tried or experienced. The flavours/tastes didn't compliment each other or stood out to us at all, so we didn't really experience the ""fusion"" in any of the dishes except for the tacos. 

Some of the criticism agreed by my entire table for certain dishes were:

- the braised beef tasted exactly like the beef in pho, which is weird because the seasoning is completely different
- the wontons were a bit too salty 
- the trout was a bit too oily for us
- not enough sauces on the beef carpaccio, so it was too plain

Not only were the tastes not there, the portions were ridiculously small for the price (especially the tacos), aside from the trout. We usually order the same amount of food for 4 girls elsewhere and never finish - we finished all of the food here and were still hungry! Our final bill was $200 on the dot after taxes which is supposed to be AVERAGE I guess... but not worth it at DaiLo because we weren't full/satisfied. I feel like we could've spent the same amount elsewhere and gotten a better experience with food and actually be full afterwards. 

Despite the food not meeting our expectations, service was outstanding and impeccable. Our server was very patient with us and answered all of our questions, and explained each dish that came out beautifully. Our waters were always filled, and dishes were cleared quickly so our table was never too crowded. It was very quick to get his attention too when needed. 

Would I come back? Most likely not. I applaud DaiLo for trying with the the whole fusion scene but it just didn't work for us. The ""fusion"" additions they tried weren't enough to make most of the dishes stand out to us, the dishes tasted far too familiar at home... Sucks because we all really wanted to like this place!"
DaiLo	4	2019-04-14	"Had chef's tasting menu($65), which offers variety of dishes to try. It's a great way to explore.

Food worth mentioning: fired watermelon, fired fish(taste a bit oily at the end), pork belly

The noodle with boiling oil pouring from the top taste too salty and the noodle is hard."
DaiLo	4	2019-01-11	"Picked up bae from school figured we eat downtown since we rarely get the chance. Came here in hopes they had the Peking Duck like at little DaiLo and previous reviews also said they did (1 review from a year ago to be exact) sadly they didn't but still had a pretty good late dinner. 

Service was spotty, it was the end of the night we were one of the last tables to walk in, understandable. The basis were covered but wasn't anything spectacular. 

Ordered 3 dishes, truffle fried rice, dry aged ribeye, and the beef tataki/tartare..? cant remember. 

truffle fried rice was PACKED with umami flavour and the side xo sauce enhanced the rice to a new level, I should've asked for more of the it. 

dry aged ribeye steak was also tender as fffffffff, cooked perfect medium rare and pre-cut just the way I like it. Sauce on top was alright a little too tangy and sour for the girlfriend, I didn't mind it but could've had it on the side and wouldn't have cared about it either. 

the beef tartare or whatever it was, wasn't too memorable would've rather had a different app but wasn't a bad dish either, 3/5. 

I'll come back for the fried rice and try other things in the future but it was a tad expensive. in my opinion this is the type of place you go once and a while when you wanna splurge."
DaiLo	5	2019-06-20	"Dailo's tasting menu is hands down the best meal I've ever had in Toronto. Period! This is solely my opinion, as someone at the table beside me actually LICKED their plate. Yup, I saw that! 

We came to Dailo on a Saturday night to celebrate a birthday. I called a week in advance to book a table for Saturday night and if you plan to visit, I suggest you do the same. It gets packed! I specifically requested the corner table by the window to get a little more privacy, as the seating arrangement is very tight. 

We knew that we wanted to try the tasting menu, given that we've never been to the restaurant before.  It did not disappoint! For $65.00 pp, we received a total of five courses each (10 in total), plus a refreshing dessert. The tasting menu changes with every visit, but the wait staff was kind enough to fulfill our  request of trying certain dishes (I.e. fried watermelon). Skip through the next couple of paragraphs to find out what the tasting menu consisted of, otherwise, stay for my rambling. 

The drinks menu is a little restrictive for those who may not want to order an entire bottle. There is an extensive wine and sake list, with only several options that are served by the glass. I'm a huge fan of orange wine and I was disappointed to find out that it was only served by the bottle. Nevertheless, there is a great selection of cocktails, beer/ciders, and spirits that provide a single serving. 

The decor of the restaurant is whimsical to say the least. From the outside, it has the aesthetic of a century-old storefront, whereas the inside is an ironic take on a 50s Hollywood movie about the ""Far East."" Given the precious name of the restaurant, this was surely done with sarcasm in mind. The bathrooms are tiger balm scented (no, I'm not joking), which again plays with nostalgia and irony all at the same time. 

The tasting menu blew us away! The entire dining experience took about two hours to complete and we never felt rushed. Check the photos for all the dishes that were included in the tasting menu. I will be surely returning!"
DaiLo	4	2019-09-01	"[4.5/5 STARS] TLDR: HUGE FAN! My boyfriend brought me here for our one year anniversary dinner. Fave thing I ate here was the deep fried octopus tacos. The jicama shell was the most interesting take on a taco shell I've ever had. 

We started off with some house cocktails. I one that tasted like gin and he got the one with scotch. They were okay. 

The food on the other hand. Delicious! We couldn't decide which dishes to try, the waitresses and waiters were really helpful they suggested the tasting menu which is $68/person and made up of 5 courses of the Dailo's ""greatest hits"" - popular items on and off the menu. Probably the best decision we made. We made sure they knew my dietary restrictions and we were good to go!

They started us off with two amuse-bouche's which was a like a yam dressed in sake. So good! Next course was the Crispy Octopus Tacos (my fave!!!) and Pomelo Betel Leaf. I love the freshness of the lemon grass and the contrast with textures from the nut crumble. Third course was an carnita empanada with satay sauce (not on their current menu) and this tofu tomato salad that tasted like a play on a dairy-free (no mozzarella) caprese salad. The dough for the empanada was sweeter than i was used to but the sauce was so savoury! It made the dish for me! The tofu in the salad was prepared in a way to almost taste like the texture of cheese. It was very interesting and tasty as well. Fourth course we were served their Ontario Pea Dumplings (with truffles) - so rich so heavy so savoury very yummy - and their Hakka Brown Wontons. The sauce with the almond crumble on the wontons was to die for! The wontons themselves tasted so homey. I loved it. Lastly our fifth course was the lamb and sticky rice dish that came with a slaw (so good!!!) and the beet coconut curry dish. By the time I was done with the huge piece of lamb I didn't even have enough room to really enjoy the beet coconut curry. I liked them both though. They finished us off with a ginger sorbet palette cleanser. It was a lot of food for $68/person. I think if you have an appetite this is a great value for the quality of food you get. 

The only criticism I had was that at the end of the meal everything was starting to taste like betel leaf - that minty peppery taste - they had used it chopped up in most of the dishes they served us. The dishes on it's own with the betel leaf were delicious if we ordered that solely, but as a tasting menu, it was sort of overplayed all together."
DaiLo	5	2019-09-03	"One word - Amazing. 

I got the tasting menu and was absolutely floored. A great fusion of various Asian influences and still stayed traditionally Chinese. Bold flavors and super balanced with fun textures. 

Go for the tasting menu but if that seems too much Is recommend the truffle fried rice, all the dumplings, octopus taco and their drinks!"
DaiLo	4	2019-06-03	Cool little Asian fusion spot in Toronto.  Came here with a group of 4 and we got the lobster and duck to share.  It's a bit pricy but the food was amazing and we were all full afterwards.  We also got the fried watermelon as an app and it was just as good as it sounds.
DaiLo	4	2019-07-28	"Dailo is a unique, great restaurant.  It's typically possible to get a table within an hour of showing up, they have a patio right in collage.  

What I really like is the unique dishes. Everything has lots of thought and work put into it. 

My only negative is that they have too much fried food.  Otherwise the menu and quality is fantastic."
DaiLo	5	2019-08-03	"We happened upon DaiLo during a visit to Toronto and it easily became my favorite meal of the trip. Everything on the menu looked incredible so we opted for the six-course tasting menu. 

Texture was at the forefront of this meal; every dish had a lovely dynamic of ingredients. We started with a bite of squash soup and a betel leaf with puffed rice. We then had the octopus tacos (must get!), which were wrapped in a thin slice of jicama instead of tortillas. That was followed by a delicious soup with scallop ceviche -- I wanted to drink the broth. Pea dumplings with truffles were exquisite. The beef with gnocchi wasn't a highlight for me but still was a solid dish. The meal finale was an entire fried trout with a zesty salad. I normally would have been too intimidated to order such a dish, but this was spectacular. 

For ~$60, this was an incredible value, with every single dish being quite impressive and unique. Service was excellent, I really appreciated that each dish was explained as it came out. Would 100% return."
DaiLo	5	2019-01-12	"Delicious experience and the chef's ability to execute on Chinese fusion is totally on point. 

To me, this place told the perfect story of childhood nostalgia and modern French cuisine.

We made reservations via telephone, but you could also do so on OpenTable. 

Service was fantastic and ours really knew is stuff when telling us about the dish being served. 

Wife & I ended up going with the Dailo's Choice  chef's tasting menu ($65 pp) and were not disappointed! We asked if we could have a few must-have items as part of it, and they were happy to accommodate! Amazing!

To me, the most memorable & nostalgic dish was dessert. It was a Pandan and, wait for it, WHITE RABBIT CANDY icecream with tumeric crisps and some sponge cake. Apparently it was the winner of an internal dish challenge amongst the cooks 2 days ago and it totally blew our minds! Amazing for them to do this and so glad they did!

The amuse bouche was some sort of soup with sesame oil, while don't remember what it was exactly, was so flavourful to start the meal!

Other dishes that were very notable and highly recommend are octopus tacos, truffle fried rice with homemade XO sauce (the XO sauce is amazing), fried watermelon (something unique and yummy), smoked duck platter (so many different flavours & textures!), Melt in your mouth pork hock, and their interpretation of turnip cakes.

All in all, delicious experience and really enjoyed the tasting menu.

When we return, we'll probably try Al a carte to try a few more other dishes. But if it's your 1st time, you can't go wrong with the Dailo's Choice."
DaiLo	5	2018-12-03	"I had heard a little buzz about Dai Lo from some friends visiting from out of town. They raved about their Chef's menu and I knew I had to try it. I made reservation a couple days ahead of time... for a Wednesday dinner. They had no problem fitting us in. 

My first impression was a classy fusion between asian and western decor. Cozy, and not at all pretentious. I had to wait about 20 minutes for my friend, but I ordered myself a cocktail. The staff were polite and didn't give me a hard time about not being ready on time. 

We selected the Chef's choice menu and we had absolutely no idea what an emotional, and gastronomical adventure awaited us. If I go over my photos, I think I can count 11 separate dishes. Some small, some sizeable... all unique and heavenly. All of that for $67 pp?!? It's a steal.

I am not going to describe all the items, because I don't want to spoil it for you (and I don't recall). I really appreciate that they check for allergies and general dislikes before you start ordering. They explain each dish carefully and give you enough time between the dishes to savour and enjoy every bite. 

If you are not able to finish the last few dishes, they will pack it up for you. Left over fried rice + braised beef for lunch...mmm

Just like this review, I can ramble on about Dai Lo and not make any sense. I highly recommend you experience it for yourself."
Hong Kong Bistro Cafe	5	2020-01-19	"I love this place! Really hits the spot for some chinese fast food/afternoon snackies. Might be a bit hard to find, they usually have a sign outside with their specials and you have to walk up a flight of stairs to get to the actual restaurant.

My personal favourite is the pork chop baked rice - I pretty much get this every single time.

They have everything on the menu from fries and chicken wings to fried rice to baked oysters. If you can imagine it, they can probably make it! They also have a bunch of daily specials that also come with a soup (either cream or borscht) and I think a drink included in the price - a pretty good deal if you want something more plentiful."
Hong Kong Bistro Cafe	1	2019-12-31	"Just prepared that you may wait more than 50 mins for food serving. i came here twice. each time me and my friends will waiting more than 50 mins for food after we ordered. no matter how many customers in here. they are always very slow. even fried rice, they will take that long.

And the fried rice. Are not totally sauced... even it took 50 mins to make."
Hong Kong Bistro Cafe	4	2019-11-10	"Food: 4 Stars
Service: 4 Stars
Ambience: 3.5 Stars
Fill Factor: Stuffed

I must have passed by this place for a very very long time but did not know anything about it until recently. The restaurant is on the second floor of one of the buildings on Dundas and aside from the big hanging sign outside I did not really notice it was there. After finally trying this place I am kicking myself for not coming here sooner.

The menu was fairly extensive and ranged from lighter options such as sandwiches to HK style milk tea to pork chop rice. The best way to describe the food at Hong Kong Cafes would be filling, inexpensive comfort food. There were several items I wanted to order but decided on the pork chop with tomato sauce and rice (you have the option of rice or spaghetti). The waitress also brought me a bowl of hot soup to start which was great. When my rice arrived I was happily surprised at the portion size and how delicious the food looked. I quickly dug in and was very pleased with the taste of the food. The tomato sauce was plentiful and a bit sour like I prefer and the pork chop was nice and crispy on the outside. It was an enjoyable meal and I was stuffed when I was finished with the food.

The service was good here as the staff were all friendly and checked in on me often. Many of the people that came in seemed to be regulars so there was a lot of friendly chit chat between the customers and the staff which gave the place a friendly vibe.
The restaurant itself is not overly big but offers a fair amount of seating. The place feels clean and the seats were comfortable.

I am glad I finally gave this place a try as I really enjoyed the experience. I look forward to my next visit and will hopefully I will be more hungry so I can try more items on their menu."
Hong Kong Bistro Cafe	5	2020-03-12	"This place has had its changes, I haven't been here in a while and it has drastically improved in the modern era look. Everything is well up to date in terms of presentation. I just got my regular Hong Kong beef spaghetti noodle. Tasted great as always, nothing has changed since the last time I've been there. Definitely a cheap place to get your food fix. Will come back when I'm in the downtown Chinatown area.
The establishment is on the second floor, if you have mobility issue it is going to be difficult to get up to the second floor."
Hong Kong Bistro Cafe	5	2019-11-07	I have been here a few times. I don't know much about Hong Kong style food, but the food here is really good. I am pretty snobby with Chinese food and this place is one of the few places I will go to. The first time I went I was a little scared because it felt very bare-boned/sketchy but get past that and you will have some great food. The staff was very accommodating of our request for vegetarian options. Great food and staff. Note that you have to travel up a steep set of stairs to get to this second floor restaurant so not accessible and you'll have to fold up that stroller to bring it up.
Hong Kong Bistro Cafe	4	2018-08-07	"Cheap & Chinese Version of 3 Course Meal
Great value for food

Location: 2nd floor on top of a store on Dundas, a bit hard to find
Food: 4/5
Service: 3/5
Decor: the restaurant is pretty nice renovated and clean.

I came here many times because the value of food is here is awesome. This place is a true fusion between west and east.
1st time we came here, we ordered the dinner special, which is a 3-course meal with a soup, a starter, lamb/chicken as main. I think the price for a set is around $25. It is definitely a good value. For the main course, you could choose between rice and pasta. Both of us are so full afterward.
2nd time we came here, we ordered the afternoon special. I think it is under $10, you could order a dish + a drink. I ordered beef pasta.
I highly recommend this place if you want to try great fusion food."
Hong Kong Bistro Cafe	4	2018-08-13	"I was so worried this restaurant would be packed when I walked in on Saturday afternoon with a party of 8.  Thank god it was only half full.

The restaurant is on a 2nd level and somewhat small but not too crowded.  
The menu is extensive and you can get pretty much everything that's available in Markham.

I got:
1. Grilled chicken with spaghetti in black peppercorn sauce
- This was delicious.  The pasta was soft without being soggy and I think they melted a little of butter into it - yum.  
- The chicken was a good size and cooked perfectly.  
- The sauce complemented the whole dish, I would definitely reorder.
2. The beef skewers were great. But for $8 it was hefty for 4 skewers. We also found a small fly in our fruit salad. The waiter took off my lemonade ice tea to placate us and gave us another small bowl of fruit salad.  
3. Chicken fried rice. I shuddered a little when my boyfriend ordered this but it turned out very well overall.  The rice wasn't soaked in soy sauce and tasted like your usual chow fan with nice big chunks of chicken and eggs.

Overall this is a pretty good place to hit up if you're craving HK style food.

Service is Chinese (ie. not friendly but very efficient).
Tip: Waiter here speaks both Cantonese and English fluently (huge plus for anybody that's afraid of a language barrier)."
Hong Kong Bistro Cafe	4	2019-08-29	This place is good! The food is delicious(curry and other meals), and the waiter is friendly. Nice and cozy environment makes it a better place to hang out with friends here. Will come next time.
Hong Kong Bistro Cafe	4	2018-05-07	"It's one of the few Hong Kong cafes (Cha chaan teng) in Chinatown that i'm aware of. It's hidden on the second floor and easy to miss. However, when found, it's a good option for Hong Kong-style Western cuisine in Chinatown.

I really liked their Baked Pork Chop Rice. It was tasty and tangy with generous portions. I would return just for this dish. My mom had the shrimp salad which was generously topped with fruit and shrimp. The Russian Borscht soup was also solid.

Service was friendly and the food came out quickly. Pricing is also pretty affordable. The ambiance is a bit cramped and noisy, but that's to be expected in Chinatown. 

The one thing I found off-putting was the presence of dirty glassware on cashier counter-top. It's almost as if they didn't have any other space for it, as there were 10 or so dirty glasses in plain site.

Other than that, I had a positive experience and will be returning in the future."
Hong Kong Bistro Cafe	3	2018-01-04	"Hong Kong Bistro Cafe is a HK cafe (cha chaan teng) located in downtown Chinatown. Living in Scarborough, there are tons of HK cafe options in Upper Scarborough and Markham but surprisingly not many downtown that I'm aware of.

HK cafes (cha chaan tengs) serve low cost Canto-Western cuisine and this is a result of Britain's colonization of Hong Kong and as a result it ended up impacting the food served.

I have been to a Hong Kong Bistro Cafe a few times and dropped by recently on a late Friday afternoon during the holiday season. I ordered the lunch special which was a baked grouper in a tomato sauce over a bed of spaghetti, it also came with a soup (choice of Chinese soup, cream soup and Russian Borscht which is essentially a tomato soup) and a HK milk tea for $8.50 plus tax. The spaghetti was pretty basic but the baked grouper was cooked perfectly, really well done. The Russian borscht (tomato soup) soup was basic and the HK milk tea was above average.

Hong Kong Bistro Cafe is a pretty good option downtown if you are looking for a HK cafe and really reasonably priced and service is pretty fast. The food won't blow you away but it's pretty good and the portions are pretty big and fulfilling especially for the price point."
Hong Kong Bistro Cafe	4	2018-08-22	"Richmond Hill is full of these types of places (asian style white food...sorry if this was not PC) that are so great, but Toronto seemed to be falling short. However, this place fills that niche, with only the slight price difference being apparently different. 

I ordered the chicken friend steak with an escargot appetizer and a cold lemon tea (with an additional dollar for a cold drink). My friend got the steak (which was actually cooked medium rare, with the fruit salad in mayo sauce appetizer, and a hot lemon tea. The appetizer were good, and came quickly. The entrees were huge, and tasted delicious with the classic Chinese black pepper gravy. The tea is not what you come here for, but it wasn't bad, just not noteworthy in terms of Chinese tea. Both of our meals also came with a soup option that was the classic Chinese borscht - that is more tomato soup than borscht. 

Service is pretty average, but food is fast, so I was happy! This is kind of what I expect from most Chinese restaurants. I will definitely be back to try their other specials!!!!"
Hong Kong Bistro Cafe	5	2018-08-31	"The first thing we noticed upon stepping foot into this restaurant was the clean looking, upscale decor. A very pleasant surprise for a Chinese restaurant in the middle of Chinatown!

We ordered the baked pork chop with rice and baked beef brisket with rice. They first served us our complimentary soup, which was one of three of their daily soups. We chose the chinese and tomato soups.

The soups came out immediately, which gave us something to sip on while waiting for the main dishes. The chinese soup was light and pleasant, and the tomato soup was rich and flavourful.

The main dishes came about ten minutes later. Even though it was my first time trying the much hyped tomato pork chop, I knew immediately that it was definitely worth the hype! The pork chops were crispy coming straight out of the oven, and the tomato sauce was the best tasting thing I've ever had in Chinatown. It was just so rich, juicy, creamy, and delicious overall. The beef brisket was also great. The amount of brisket was a very generous portion, and the brisket itself was very tender and soft.

I'd definitely recommend Hong Kong Bistro Cafe for their HK style baked dishes. They're quite different from other types of Chinese cuisine, and definitely worth a try!"
Hong Kong Bistro Cafe	4	2019-10-30	"Very authentic hong kong bistro, always a big selection of food and the portion sizes are great.

Highly recommend the baked porkchop rice!

They also have a wide selection of soups that are very decent."
Hong Kong Bistro Cafe	4	2019-05-09	A solid china town find. The food is plentiful, delicious and worth it. I love eating their specials because they have great appetizers, soups, teas and set menus. It's pretty cheap for how much you get. I can't describe what Hong Kong style food It's a mix of British influenced Asian food. I always go for spaghetti!
Hong Kong Bistro Cafe	4	2018-06-25	"We decided to check out Chinatown on our first night in Toronto.  We were in search of something authentic that we couldn't find where we live.  There were so many choices that we were having trouble deciding so we did a Yelp search and took a quick look at the reviews.  That led us to this place.  

The restaurant is on the second floor so you will need to look for the stairs beside the sign.  The specials were written on the white boards on the wall.  The regular menu has a ton of choices and some of them I had to look up on the internet.  Our server was very friendly and helpful with questions we had the entrees.  

I ordered the Fried Ho Fun with Beef and Black Bean Sauce.  I've never had a black bean sauce that I didn't like so I knew I would probably like this dish.  I didn't know what Ho Fun was but our server described it as a soft noodle so I decided to step outside my comfort zone and give it a try.  Our server brought a cup of the soup special while our food was being prepared.  I chose a creamy soup with chicken.  It was delicious.  The Ho Fun noodles were very good and the black bean sauce was excellent.  There was too much food for me to finish but I made sure to eat all the beef.  

This was a very enjoyable new food adventure for us."
Hong Kong Bistro Cafe	5	2019-08-15	Came here for the grilled chicken steak with pepper corn sauce and it didn't disappoint! The chicken was moist and crispy. The sauce didn't overpower the dish but complimented the chicken. Entree also came with a soup - you have a choice of Chinese seaweed, corn or Russian borscht - I choose the Russian borscht. It had a pleasant tomato flavour with pieces of veggies swimming about. Prices are excellent considering the portions. As for the service, the staff were very friendly and accommodating; Attentive but not bothersome. Overall I highly recommended coming here if your looking for HK style diner food. On my momma, you'll love it.
Hong Kong Bistro Cafe	4	2018-03-12	"I'm a visual person, and I got to say the pictures here did not look particularly drool-worthy. Alas, do not judge a restaurant by its pictures!

We were super hungry and ordered the Hainanese Chicken Rice, Baked Pork Chop with Spaghetti and Fried Chicken Wings with Chilli Pepper Salt. We also received complimentary soup with our order.

As someone who lived in Singapore for 12 years, the authenticity of the Hainanese Chicken Rice was lacking. The meat was too tough and had a stronger ginger flavour than the usual Hainanese Chicken I was used to. The soy sauce was also missing - a big no-no. The rice, although flavoured, was quite dry. Overall, I would pass this dish and head over to Jackpot Chicken Rice instead.

The redeeming dishes of this cafe were definitely the Pork Chop and Chicken Wings. While the spaghetti was completely different from regular Western pasta (its slightly sweeter and lighter), it complemented the pork chop superbly. The chicken wings, tossed in a chilli and pepper stir fry, is fragrant, savoury, and had a nice crunch. My boyfriend says it may be the best chicken wings he has had!

Definitely don't overlook this cafe!"
Hong Kong Bistro Cafe	5	2017-06-21	"This place is awesome. The food is cheap, the food is good, the food is unique. Chinese style spaghetti? Yes please.

It's a bit hidden, you have to go up some narrow stairs to reach the restaurant. The decor is pretty plain but it's not disgusting inside like some other hole-in-the-walls.

I always get the baked spaghetti with seafood in white sauce here. The flavours are so good, the calamari in it is so crispy even when doused in the sauce. Come here with a few friends and try a bit of everything if you can. Or just come back as often as you can!"
Hong Kong Bistro Cafe	4	2018-04-22	"Revisiting Hong Kong Bistro Cafe after their renovation, it was like a totally new experience. The place looks much more modern and inviting. As always, super friendly service and solid food. 

I got the grilled chicken steak with black pepper sauce on rice - it was absolutely delicious and it's become my favourite dish there! There was plenty of sauce covering the chicken, which was perfectly cooked as it was tender yet had nice crispy edges. For $11, you get a giant portion and I could only finish about half of it. 

The baked pork chop on rice with tomato sauce comes in a large dish but it does take some time to cook. It was very good - the crispy pork chop pieces were tasty and they certain don't skimp on the meat portion compared to the rice. 

Lastly, I never pass up the opportunity to get their HK-style milk tea. It's a nice balance of the slight bitterness of the tea and creaminess of the milk. 

Overall, Hong Kong Bistro Cafe may not have a flashy menu or ""Instagrammable"" food presentation, but it's delicious food at an excellent price with on point service."
Hong Kong Bistro Cafe	4	2016-12-24	"If you don't know about this place or wasn't intentionally looking for it, then you've probably walked past it without noticing. Sandwiched between other Chinese restaurants, you have to walk up a set of stairs to get to the actual restaurant. The decor is straight out of the 70s and to be honest looks a little dingy. 

However, appearances aside, this place serves up some authentic HK cafe (Cha Chaan Tang) food. The menu is extensive and eclectic, with a huge selection of fusion items, anything from Portuguese seafood rice to sandwiches. Service was a bit slow, it took almost an hour for us to receive our food from the time we ordered. I believe all entrees come with soup, which helped ride us over. 

Despite the lack of signage outside the restaurant, the place was surprisingly busy. 

Whether you're missing the food from HK or just want to try something different, give this literal hidden gem a shot."
Lee Chen Asian Bistro	4	2020-02-21	"If you find yourself in downtown Toronto looking for asian food, head to Lee Chen Asian Bistro.  The place is downstairs from the sidewalk and is huge inside...I mean huge.  I suspect they do a great lunch business, but we came after a hockey game on our way back to the hotel. 

The service was prompt and always available if you need anything.  The bar/beer scene doesn't offer a lot, but there are a few options to pick from if your in need. 

The spring rolls and chicken dumplings were really, really good.  I had sweet and sour chicken which is some of the best I have ever had anywhere.  

I definitely would go back and probably spend more time ordering a lot of dim sum as there is a lot to pick from if that is your jam.  They have a huge menu and one trip is not going to satisfy your palate."
Lee Chen Asian Bistro	3	2020-05-04	"Lee Chen is an upscale chinese restaurant in the core of the downtown area. Unlike the more dingy (or more authentic) restaurants on Spadina, Lee Chen is carefully decorated and has more catered service. It is the kind of place you bring your in-laws for family dinners and not your friends after a night out. It is deceptively large since it spans the full basement level of the building, so it is easy to find seating.

Expect to find the usual Americanized Chinese dishes here, with flavors that are catered to the general population. Don't expect to find the more 'exotic' dishes or the sharp flavors that Chinese cuisine has to offer."
Lee Chen Asian Bistro	3	2020-01-23	"Came here for team lunch for CNY. Oh man. This place is packed! When we got to the reception desk, the group in front of us did not have a reservation. They were turned away. Glad we did book the day before. 

Anyhow, Chinese food option in the financial district can be rare. And when my colleagues proposed  this place. I was thinking, let's give this a try. 

We got here and were led to our table. After we sat down, I saw the other tables were filled up in 15 mins. Talk about busy. One good thing is they got a lot of staff roaming around to deliver food. Yet, they were super busy regardless. 

We ordered our food and I went with the business lunch with meatball. The food did come out shortly after. The sauce for the meatball isn't super salty. Which I prefer. It has the right texture for the meatball. Other stuff tasted okay. It ain't bad overall, I wasn't wowed by the food."
Lee Chen Asian Bistro	4	2019-11-01	"First glance of the clientele was a solid sign it would be authentic stuff.  The food was very good! I didn't think it was that ""pricey"" till you think about how inexpensive authentic Dim sum food can generally be. And the bill wasn't what many other reviewers are probably used to. I think still worth it for the most part. 

The crystal pork belly was great. The thick noodles in the fried Shanghai noodles where delicious and greasy. The soup dumplings were good, but I think these miss the value to price point the most. 

I would definitely come back. Just be aware it is business district prices."
Lee Chen Asian Bistro	4	2019-08-17	"My friends and I love Lee Chen, we come here occasionally to get some Chinese food. The food is not bad, and it's pretty filling. We usually go to their young location but stumble upon this location last time. Comparing to their other location, this one is definitely nicer and bigger.

The only thing is that food is quite expensive here, other than that I don't mind making the trip here once in awhile."
Lee Chen Asian Bistro	4	2019-12-18	"Overall a good experience at Lee Chen. We were heading to the theatre and decided to drop by for dinner. There was still lots of tables available at 6pm on a Wednesday. 

We went for the Shanghai Noodles, pork dumplings, chicken fried rice and Wuxi spare ribs. Everything was tasty and exactly what we expected. A lot of times, the food would not come out as pictured, but this was not the case. 

Overall a solid Asian restaurant considering it is located in an area that isn't known for the Asian food. Service was swift and the restaurant was roomy. Felt like we were eating in Markham vs. Downtown Toronto."
Lee Chen Asian Bistro	4	2019-10-29	Excellent food and good service.  The soup dumplings were worth all the hype.  There is a technique to eating them, so don't be shy to ask the waiter to show  you how --fantastically delicious.  The ginger shrimp and pepper beef were equally delicious.  Fried rice was surprisingly greasy and dishes do NOT come with any white rice, you must order (that is why only four stars).  Otherwise, this is a great place to eat, with nice ambience.
Lee Chen Asian Bistro	3	2019-04-01	"The interior here is spacious and clean, which makes it a good place for happy hour or business meals. The servers were quick, but it took some effort to get their attention sometimes. 

We had the dan dan noodles, pork belly over rice, XLB, and pan fried dumplings. Although this was a mix of appetizers and dimsum, the amount of food was just enough for us. My favorite was the dan dan noodles, especially with the hot chili oil for those that like spice. 

Overall I had a good dining experience but was a bit disappointed with the dimsum selection. I was looking for a good dimsum restaurant in Chinatown and, for being labeled a dimsum restaurant, there wasn't that much."
Lee Chen Asian Bistro	4	2019-08-07	"Lee Chen Asian Bistro is a decent spot for Chinese food near the theatres and financial district. It may look small from the outside, but it's quite large and spacious in the inside. The interior is very clean with nice decor. It even has a small garden and mini running waterfall just outside of the restaurant (great if you can score a table by the window, facing the mini garden). The customer service is very attentive and superior for a Chinese restaurant (e.g. the servers come by your desk to ask if everything is ok a few times throughout the meal, which usually doesn't happen in most other Chinese restaurants).

The menu contains some typical Chinese dishes. During weekday lunch hours, they have a separate lunch ""combo"" specials which are pretty good. Each combo comes with a choice of carbs (white rice, brown rice, fried rice, or fried noodles), meal entrée (protein / veg choices), bowl of side salad, and a spring roll. I ordered the brown rice and it came in a cute bamboo container. The entrée was nicely presented on an edible open flower-shaped bowl made out of crispy wonton skin.

The restaurant is a great choice for having a business or team lunch. The large space can accommodate large parties if booked in advance. The ambience is also nice and not too loud."
Lee Chen Asian Bistro	5	2019-09-13	I was in Canada for TIFF for near all the theaters so I was happy to find this place nearby. I was SO excited to try to the soup dumplings and they did not disappoint! They were small but generally filled well with soup! The dumpling itself was so delicious! I also tried a noodle dish which was very under flavored but the noodles were cooked perfectly. Definitely go for the soup dumplings! You don't be disappointed!
Lee Chen Asian Bistro	4	2019-06-15	I've never had authentic Chinese food before, so not sure what to compare it to. But the food I had here was simple and flavorful. I had the Shanghai noodles, bok choy with garlic and veggie dumplings. This was a lot of food for two people but we finished it. Everything tasted very fresh and light. Service was a little slow even though the restaurant was empty.
Lee Chen Asian Bistro	1	2019-07-19	"Thought this place would live to the rating but it fell flat, and flavorless. We ordered our food and it literally came in 2 minutes. (Yikes!)

Everything was bland and lacking sauce. Service was nice and welcoming, but the food was just subpar and overpriced. I'd save your money."
Lee Chen Asian Bistro	4	2018-11-25	"I suppose that the price is expected since it is located on King St. W near all these theatres in the heart of the financial district, but it was still quite pricy for the amount of food that they give.

The size of an order of white rice alone was a third of the typical full round bowl of rice in most other Chinese restaurants yet here it costs $2 simply because how it's presented in small wooden steam baskets.

If you are going for a play nearby like my beau and I were or a financier working nearby or maybe going on a downtown date, then this would be the ideal Asian fusion cuisine you will go to. It is classy enough without being downright expensive.

Location: 4/5

It is right next to the Royal Alexandria Theatre or across from the Roy Thompson Hall, a bit west of St. Andrew's Station. So many things nearby to do and see before or after having a meal here.

Decor/Ambience: 4/5

It is located in the basement and parts of the restaurant is dim, but there are small lights here and there on both the ceiling and on the sides of the wall. They have two huge round tables at the back that when not reserved by a large group of people, singles or pairs of individuals would be sitting around the table during busy hours. Otherwise, they have tables for twos and fours scattered throughout the restaurant and a lovely little enclosed area that can be reserved. Red flowers and red lanterns decorated the space and gave it warmth. Since it's neither too dark or too bright inside, each table felt secluded enough for conversations to mingle and intertwine of the buzzling backdrop.

Food quality: 4.5/5

My Thai green curry shrimp with spaghetti was superb! The flavours were incredibly full bodied. Plenty of veggies especially peppers and red onions and the curry was just amazing! The spaghetti was not enough alone to soak in all of that rich flavour or oozing liquid, so I had to order a 'bowl' of white rice. They gave 7 tiger shrimps that tasted great alone or dipped with the curry.

My beau ordered Szechuan style shrimps and scallops and his was spicier than mine and even bolder in flavours.  
Both styles of shrimps had us smacking our lips and licking the sauce from our fingers. The scallops were sizeable and I definitely enjoyed the meaty texture.

The quality of food is totally there, so I will definitely come back when I am nearby again.

Their menu is quite extensive actually, so I am sure there will be plenty of other food options that I can order for my next meal here before a musical or the likes.

Service: 3.5/5

Pretty standard, but they refilled our water without having to be asked and they served our dishes rather quickly, so we were in and out within 40 minutes, including the time waiting to be seated and getting the bill. Not bad. 

I think most items are meant to be shared, but we are used to having individual dishes each. 

Value: 4/5

Expected price due to the location. Food quality is above average but not the best. I would not say that it tasted all that authentic, but that is again to be expected of Asian fusion restaurant. It certainty has a nice mix of flavours and food options, so my beau and I can certainly see ourselves coming back. Hopefully, we will order something more satisfying though next time that includes rice or more spaghetti, cause $2 for that small amount of rice as photoed made me raise my eyebrows."
Lee Chen Asian Bistro	4	2019-12-22	The service was fast, staff was friendly. Their soup wanton was so good I had to get two orders! The soup within the steamed dumpling was complimented beautifully with their pickled ginger & red vinegar! The pork belly bao was interesting since you can construct it yourself, and the flavour of the marinated pork was mouthwatering. However, the menu is very long and the main dishes   are an afterthought compared to their dim sum.
Lee Chen Asian Bistro	5	2020-01-25	It's definitely a hidden gem! You have to go down some stairs off of the main street and it'll be on your right! It was the first spot we hit after touching down in Toronto because of the amazing reputation it has. That salt and pepper chicke was OUT OF THIS WORLD! 2 simple seasonings yet so full of flavor. The chow mein was perfect in every way and kung pao beef was juicy, spicy, and perfectly tender! Can't wait to go back
Lee Chen Asian Bistro	3	2019-06-18	"My friend and I were in the area, craving Chinese food, and didn't want to walk too far, so we came here for dinner on a Saturday night. The restaurant is nice on the inside and well kept. The waitstaff are friendly enough and pretty attentive. The food is pretty overpriced though and lacks flavor.

My friend ordered the green onion pancake and wonton soup. I had the spicy beef noodle soup. The green onion pancake was average, but the wonton soup broth had pretty good flavor. There were only three small wontons though, which my friend wasn't happy about. I wish the beef noodle soup had some flavor - it tasted like spicy and mildly salty water, which was surprising given how rich the soup looked. The noodles had a nice springy-ness to them, and there was A LOT of beef. I usually complain there isn't enough beef in my noodle soups, but I couldn't finish all the beef in my soup this time!

I'd consider taking friends here if they've only grown up on burgers their whole life and want to try Asian cuisine (maybe bring some spice packets along...), but I would not recommend this place to people who want authentic Chinese food. Take a 25 minute walk to Spadina Avenue instead."
Lee Chen Asian Bistro	5	2020-01-03	Most amazing dumpling I've had in a while!!! I ordered two different kinds and was so pleased and wish I could have had more but I was so full. I'm from upstate New York and I can't wait to come back to Toronto and come again. Along with great food the service was amazing and the bubble tea was so good as well!!! Definitely stop by if you are in the area
Lee Chen Asian Bistro	4	2018-06-27	"Wonderful Chinese restaurant serving Shanghai Cuisine! I thought this would be a tiny place with mediocre food, but it exceed expectations. The food was authentic and plentiful with great prices. From the moment I walked in, I was wowed by how beautifully decorated, clean and expansive the dining room was.

Service was very pleasant and quick. We came in half an hour before closing. I thought we would be turned away, but the staff was very polite about letting us know that they were closing soon but that they could still serve us. We were gently reminded about getting our order in, last call, and closing our bill without feeling rushed.

The food exceeded my expectations. We got xiaolongbao soup dumplings, pickled greens noodle soup, green onion pancake, and fried potstickers. Everything was delicious and very well priced. The portion sizes were generally good. The noodle soup was massive and a great size for sharing. The only size that seemed a little less than normal were the soup dumplings which came with only six, whereas I usually get ten in an order at other restaurants in the U.S."
Lee Chen Asian Bistro	3	2019-09-03	"Service 3/5
Taste 3/5 
This overall is only worth visiting for workday lunches. 

If one hunts for delicacy, stay away from this chain."
Lee Chen Asian Bistro	4	2018-02-18	"Came here with my family on a Saturday night. I'm surprised how empty this restaurant is, given that it's downtown at a weekend dinner time. 

We ordered soup dumplings (great), braised eggplant (great, although a bit too saucy), braised tofu (the tofu didn't really have much flavour), and a shrimp lettuce wrap (great healthy option, although I didn't care for the regular hoisin sauce that came with it), with a small side of steamed rice. 

Great service and very speedy!"
Dumpling House Restaurant	5	2020-01-04	"Lovely dumpling restaurant!

The prices here are absolutely fantastic and cheap, and the dumplings are delicious.
It's quite a hole-in-the-wall type of restaurant. It's very crowded all the time and feels sort of steamy inside during the summer hours--but what would you expect with steaming baskets and so many people?

The steamed dumplings are wonderfully juicy while the pan fried dumplings are crunchy--albeit a bit dry.
I recommend trying the soups here! Hot and sour soup is a personal favourite of mine, in general, and this place make it really well! 

I'll definitely be coming back again--but probably in the winter time."
Dumpling House Restaurant	3	2020-05-07	"With lots of businesses closing at 6pm, I'm grateful dumpling house is open late, until 10:30pm on a week night!

Since the lockdown, I've ordered their vegetarian frozen dumpling, filled with greens and diced tofu, their frozen green onion pancake and their takeout braised eggplant and sautéed green beans.

As a disclaimer, eggplants are probably my favourite things to eat, and i love how buttery it is here at Dumpling House. Just yummy! As for the sautéed green beans, FYI they are seasoned with lots of minced garlic and a spicy and tangy bean sauce. Proceed with caution if you can't take too much heat! Otherwise, to me its just mildly spicy. 

Love having this in the neighbourhood, a great spot that I'll definitely visit, hope to dine in soon!"
Dumpling House Restaurant	3	2020-04-22	"This place has great dumplings (especially their pan fried ones, pork and chive is my fave), but there was one time when I went, maybe almost 2 years ago that really pissed me off. I would be more inclined to give this place 4 stars if it weren't for poor customer treatment. 

It was busy in the restaurant and a line was forming. My friend and I had just finished our meal. I had ordered a soy milk and was finishing it while also trying to buy tickets for a movie on my phone. I was aware that there was a lineup and I was trying to hurry but not chug my drink, but I was still finishing so I didn't think it would be an issue. One of the older ladies who runs the restaurant (in Chinese we would call her the 'lao ban niang') complained loudly and angrily to her staff in Chinese that I was playing on my phone and ordered them to clean our table up in an effort to get us to leave. It doesn't sound too bad when I type it out but it's just different in Chinese and her tone was angry. Only my mom talks to me like that when she's scolding me. I was very annoyed when I heard this, but finished my drink and got up to leave. The same woman put on a fake smile and said ""thank you!"" as we walked out the door. 

In this case, she probably didn't think I would understand her, which is probably also why she said what she said, but it really ruined my meal. Unfortunately for her, I understood every word. I hope they will exercise more caution when talking about customers in Chinese. I am Asian so I am used to less than ideal service at some mom and pop restaurants so I am understanding of most service at Chinese restaurants but I also don't like being scolded behind my back, and then treated so drastically different to my face.

In that moment I dramatically vowed never to return but the dumplings are too good and I have since returned and had pleasant experiences.

I mean, I doubt the woman even remembers that this happened but it was a bad enough experience that I felt compelled to write about it so long after, but the food is still good and I would recommend this place to people who don't mind feeling rushed when they eat. 

I like the potato threads and shanghai noodles in addition to boiled and pan fried dumplings."
Dumpling House Restaurant	1	2019-08-18	"TERRIBLE AND EXTREMELY RUDE SERVICE! LEFT DISAPPOINTED WITH THE QUALITY OF FOOD. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO GO.

My parents and I came here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. We ordered Singaporean fried rice noodle and the 15 steamed chives, egg, and dry salty fish dumplings for $10.99.

1. Noodles came out first (really small portions) and then they gave us the bill. We were like what??? Where is our second dish? And they were confused. They then realized they forgot our dumplings.

2. Dumplings came and only 14 out of 15 showed up. We let it slide. 

3. Zero eggs and salty fish in the dumplings. ONLY CHIVES 

4. When my parents paid the bill, the waitress got angry at us and asked why we didn't tip ... but we did tip and it was underneath the bills. So we were like ""excuse me??? Did you even look to see?"" She flips it over and sees the tip and then changes her energy completely and starts saying thank you. This woman had the audacity to get angry at customers who she treated so poorly yet actually still tipped. Im actually speechless.

Additionally, if you're asian and you complain about the food they just get pissed right back at you. And they tell you your opinion doesn't matter cause the Caucasian people don't seem to mind. Terrible"
Dumpling House Restaurant	3	2020-01-04	Food is good, we were craving dumplings and we came to the right place. Got a variety of steamed & pan fried dumplings. Food comes pretty quickly but I wished the place was a bit cleaner. The plastic soup spoon was stained from overuse, the condiments were obviously neve really cleaned well everyday. The worst of it though was when we went to pay the bill the lady demanded we add +$2 for tip. I have never been to a restaurant that has said that to me.
Dumpling House Restaurant	4	2020-01-27	Visited on a quiet Monday evening, service was incredibly fast and our server was very friendly. This place does not take credit/debit! Cash only! We ordered the pork and chives pan fried  dumplings and they were pretty good! Nothing special, just your average pan fried dumpling. Fair price - $10 for 12.
Dumpling House Restaurant	5	2019-05-12	"If you're ever in a mood for dumplings and hot and sour soup, take a stroll down Chinatown and make your way to this hole in the wall restaurant and prepare for some delicious dumplings and more!

We started off with the hot and sour soup and a spicy potato dish to entice our appetite and clear my sinuses since I was a little sick. The hot and sour soup was one of the better soups I've had over the years and the spicy potato dish wasn't too spicy but an appetizer to share amongst the table. After a little wait the two dishes of pan friend dumplings came and let me tell you, I've never been this excited to see dumplings until now. They were crunchy, juicy from the pork inside and coated with a little bit of oil on the outside which added a nice flavour coating to the dumplings.

All in all I would definitely come here again on a rainy day and suggest this restaurant to all of my friends! 5/5 stars for the food and the staff were very nice to me and my girlfriend as well. No issues anywhere!"
Dumpling House Restaurant	3	2019-09-14	"Service was as ok, dumplings are ok (depends) place is kinda gross. 

If you're not picky then this place might have good dumplings for you, just ignore the poor cleanliness of the place then you're good! The plates they use look old, and I question the cleanliness of the stuff they use. I saw a pile of serving plates near the front where they're cooking and I couldn't figure out if it was the dirty pile or the clean pile.

Service is prompt, I've been here a couple of times. My first time was with my s.o., who is white. We pretty much got ignored most of the time, the only time they attended to us was to ask for our order and to pay. 

The second time was with my Chinese friend, she spoke in Mandarin to them and I noticed they actually filled up my water a couple of times, I have no idea if it's cause I went with her.

Now for the dumplings, my friend said that the wrapper they used was too thick for her liking, and she said it made sense since they used dough. I didn't mind but the filling of the dumpling had a gross bitterness to it, and this comes from someone that willingly eats bitter melon. The pan fried one tasted better, but near the end we got sick from eating it cause of the oil, it pooled at the bottom.

The first time I went here, I only got steamed dumplings, I got the mushroom and spinach one and it was tasty. My boyfriend got steamed pork dumplings and he didn't complain, although he seldom does. I definitely think it's a must try but you can only pay in cash so make sure you bring some. If you're with TD, you might need to trek a bit if you want an ATM, otherwise CIBC, RBC and Scotiabank clients are good since the ATMs are in close proximity"
Dumpling House Restaurant	3	2019-09-01	"CASH only. There's a bunch of banks/ATMS around the area so you're good just in case. Service is less to be desired but the dumplings were pretty solid. If it's your first time, I recommend trying 3 different flavours first for $12-13 (additional $2) instead of committing 12 dumplings to one flavour. They've got steamed and pan-fried. We really like the pork and shrimp - the only juicy and flavourful dumpling. The classic pork and chive were quite dry and the spinach needed salt to save its integrity. Tried their beef noodles and was super garlicky and the noodles were broken up which was annoying to eat.

Overall, will I be back, probably not - considering there are so many other dumpling spots in the area that will probably have better dumplings and better service."
Dumpling House Restaurant	3	2019-08-17	"You definitely come here for the dumplings and not the service. In typical Chinese fashion, the customer service here is nearly nonexistent. As we walked in, a waitress barked ""cash only"". Half way through our meal we were asked ""any more?"" and before we had a moment to discuss, we were given the bill. Finally, before we actually finished our food, a waitress started clearing our table. 

However, with that said, their dumplings are definitely their redeeming quality. They are handmade and fresh, from the wrappers to the fillings. They also offer a good variety; they have chicken, beef, pork, lamb, shrimp, and vegetarian dumplings. It is also a fairly cheap eat and it is easy to share. If you are willing to put up with poor customer service for good food, this is a decent option."
Dumpling House Restaurant	4	2019-03-17	"Had a day to spend in Toronto and had heard many good things about Chinatown so off I went.  I was in the mood for dumplings and found the reviews to be good.  

Was seated quickly and it was time to eat.  I ordered the pork steamed dumplings and Shanghai noodles and they were good.  I knew that the dumplings were going to be good when I saw them making them in the front window.   

This is a cool little restaurant that is a bit of a hole in the wall but has great food.  Service here was good and the food came out in a timely manner.   The noodles came out first and was surprised but then realized they are making the dumplings fresh in the window.  Good flavor in the noodles with lots of meat.   The dumplings came out and I was surprised with the number in the order.   

All in all food was good, service was on par and it was a good experience.  One word of warning is that they only take cash."
Dumpling House Restaurant	5	2018-12-25	"Life just isn't the same after you have been to dumpling house.  I mean- it wasn't until this very moment that I realized my town has no dumpling game whatsoever..... 

So , before going, it is important to note that this is a CASH ONLY establishment so make sure you got some paper on you.  

The food here is fantastic.  So - my insights....  I wish I hadn't been so ""safe"" with my ordering.  I wish that instead of ordering the fried dumplings, which were delicious by the way, I wish I had ordered more of the steamed dumplings.  The were Uber authentico and seemed to have their own plump juiciness, with very clearly pronounced flavors.  The little guys were amazing.  My recommendation is to try the pork and chive- very very good!   
As far as being a great place for groups or kids, this place is a hole in the wall type of joint- the whole place is close quarters- but worth it.  The very moment you walk in, it is through an open kitchen with ladies at the window hand stuffing dumplings-  it's pretty sweet."
Dumpling House Restaurant	5	2019-12-30	I am not sure why this place doesn't have better reviews, we absolutely loved it. They make it very clear from the beginning it's cash only so be prepared for that. We got the general tao's chicken which was quite good. We also got the steamed pork and chive dumplings and those are what dreams are made of. I was telling my husband we should get them shipped to us in San Diego. Would definitely come back
Dumpling House Restaurant	1	2019-12-06	"This was my second time dining at this establishment, but mark my words it is the last! While eating an order of noodles I was splitting with my gf I came across a COCKROACH!!!!!  

When I confronted the owner he looked down at my plate and saw the roach and quickly took my plate and dashed to the kitchen before I had a chance to take a photo.

The only funny and bewildering part to this is that a group of people standing behind me waiting to be seated saw what had happened and witnessed the roach in my noodles and still decided to stay and dine !!!!

FAIR WARNING TO ALL, DO NOT EAT HERE!!! COCKROACHES ARE ALSO DINING AMONG YOU!!!"
Dumpling House Restaurant	4	2018-11-12	"As a self proclaimed dumpling snob where my mom's dumplings are 15/10, this place can settle for an 8/10. 

I'm honestly surprised by the less than stellar reviews. Sure, I've been skeptical of this place myself when I pass by it as I walk in Chinatown because I don't trust window displays of women making dumplings from scratch, but upon the chance of eating here, I would recommend you go just go here already. 

I ordered the steam dumplings and they tasted made to order! The skin (which I'm most concerned about) was not that thick and the filling was just right. It was a good skin to meat ratio if you know what I'm saying. 

I got the chive with pork which I really liked. Any chive dumplings- sign me up! If I'm craving some homemade dumplings, you bet i'll come here again!!"
Dumpling House Restaurant	5	2019-06-15	"Reliable, quick and tasty. It's not fancy, not much seating, but those line ups should tell you something. 

The depth of the menu and simplicity lends itself to repeat visits."
Dumpling House Restaurant	5	2019-05-12	"Literally one of my favorite places we ate in Toronto! We stumbled upon this place in Chinatown and were not disappointed! 

The restaurant itself is small but they employees work quick to get food out fast! As you walk in, you can see the dumplings being made in the window and fried/steamed right there! The price was reasonable, the portions were huge, and the food was delicious! For two of us we definitely over ordered but could not decide what to eat and just got a bit of everything!

We ordered the fried pork dumplings, chicken fried noodles, and green onion pan cake! My favorite was the dumplings but you are at the House of Dumplings! Everything else was fantastic...we had to stop ourselves from licking the plates clean!

If in the area and visiting Chinatown, definitely check it out!!"
Dumpling House Restaurant	4	2019-04-16	"Really good food, but woefully underprepared for the dinner time rush. Very small, cramping area. They are trying to get everyone through as fast as possible and want you to order right away which is understandable but they also dont make effective use of their space which hurts them and their staff is kind of running around lost.

The dumplings are, however, 5 star. The food is wonderful, fresh, and made to order. Highly recommended but I would advise going at off hours."
Dumpling House Restaurant	5	2019-06-29	"Just wondering, should we measure authenticity in proportion to how the customer is treated? This place must be somewhere in the middle because no one had enough patience for us, but actually when we gave smiles we received a little smile back. I haven't talked yet about authenticity of food. I've been in Asian restaurants in the Toronto area where they treated us like intruders, but not this one. We needed some time to choose our food and we actually took it. Come on! We know time is money, but we really wanted to see what they actually offer. 
Our group had five people. They seated us at the table next to the wall and for sure, never again. It just doesn't work. It was too little space for five serving plates with the food we ordered, plus we wanted to share everything and it was just a mess.  It was actually my second visit here and the first time I wished they gave us a table not in the middle of the restaurant but next to the wall. Yeah, I wanted to be romantic. I think it is all about please come, order, eat and go. Faster better. 
Anyway... Food was great! We enjoyed every bit of it. We had two kinds of dumplings, fried pork and chive and steamed spinach and black mushrooms. We agreed our steamed choice was poor because it tasted bland and we actually didn't see any mushrooms in it. But you know what to do, dip it into some sauce you created and voila! Delicious! We also ordered Ma-Po's Tofu, Black Bean Beef and pork dish, not sure right now which one it was, but everything was very good. Beef was very tender, tofu in sauce extremely satisfying and pork also was nicely spiced and tasted just right. 
Definitely will go back to have more dumplings and some of great looking noodles."
Dumpling House Restaurant	4	2020-01-15	"The food was great and reasonably priced, we had the sweet and sour chicken, steamed pork & chive dumplings, and mixed vegetables. 
The service was fast and they told us it was cash-only upfront which I liked. The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was how tight/cramped the place was. The place was full (about 6:00pm Wednesday). It was difficult to walk through the aisles between the tables, and the tables are tiny so you have to Tetris all your plates to fit properly, but otherwise it was really tasty and I'd for sure go back for the food."
House of Gourmet	4	2020-02-26	"It's a bit of a no-frills place -- definitely not too fancy place by any standards. However, it's a typical Chinese resturant serving an extensive menu with hundreds of items and fairly convienient in its location and hours. It gets kinda loud inside and they only allow debit and credit card over a certain amount but that's okay. 

They have a lot of the comfort food staples, like fried rice, congee, or mapo tofu etc. I typically come here for the cold cuts like the roast duck or BBQ pork (char siu). You can get it as a dish on its own or have it over rice. 

In general, if you're looking for Chinese take-out or a simple dish over rice, this is the place to be at. They also have more expensive stuff as well, like seafood but I'm not sure how popular it is.

And oh yeah, there's Hong Kong milk tea for like two dollars, which is pretty boss."
House of Gourmet	2	2020-03-30	"Review is for take out. Normally when I order crispy chow mein, other restaurants will separate the sauce and the noodles. Not here, by the time I got home the noodles were all soggy  

The shrimp spring roll was such a disappointment with barely any shrimp, only one bite actually had shrimp in there. 

I ordered via Ritual so I thought the pick up would be simple. There is absolutely no physical distancing at all, the entrance was tight, people were crammed and confused, overall it was chaotic. Improvement needed."
House of Gourmet	5	2019-11-30	"The menu is extensive and delicious!

So many choices. I had the BBQ pork and duck rice, wonton noodles, fried noodles and fish congee. They're famous for their freshly made noodles in soup or lo mein amongst their rice and congee dishes.

For today's standards, the quantity is fairly sizeable and the price is right. Can't go wrong here. This place opens late, caters to locals and tourists, can speak (broken) English and is considered clean (and new) for old Chinatown. Definitely worth visiting if you're in the area."
House of Gourmet	5	2019-11-10	"A friend of mine invited me to have dinner here as we wanted to experience a night out in Toronto's China town. 

We ordered the Hot and Sour soup as the starting dish. The medium size was more than enough to offer two servings to four adult males with big appetites. 

Followed by a full order of the roasted duck that came in two varieties, traditional BBQ duck breast and duck chop suey. They even provided thin dumpling wraps that made it easier to eat the duck. 

The Chinese Broccoli and Salted Fish Fried Rice were the last two items in our order. The rice dish was perfectly seasoned and the salt did not over power the dish at all. 

This restaurant is perfect for a quick meal at a reasonable price right in the heart of Toronto's iconic Chinatown."
House of Gourmet	5	2020-01-30	Nothing hits better than late night Chinese food. The peking duck here is the best in Toronto! I usually get the peking duck and switch the 2nd course to duck fried rice. The first course comes with thin crepes to roll the duck, with spring onions and cucumber with hoison sauce to dip. This place is always busy, which is a great sign. The duck fried rice is PACKED with the rest of the duck. They are definitely not stingy with the meat and you really do get the rest of the duck in there! Street parking is free after 9 so it makes late night munching convenient. Love this place, highly recommend.
House of Gourmet	4	2019-10-24	"Food: 4 Stars
Service: 4 Stars
Ambience: 3 Stars
Fill Factor: Stuffed

I used to pass by this place all the time but rarely ever went in until a few years ago when I dined here with some friends. Since that day I have been coming here way too often and I consider this place to be my go to in Chinatown when I crave Chinese food.

The menu here is huge and it ranges from the BBQ pork/roast duck hanging in the window to fried rice/noodles/congee to seafood and much more. With so many options it is always difficult to make up my mind what to order however I do have some go to dishes when I simply can't make up my mind. My first recommendation is the ginger and onion lobster which is my personal favourite style of lobster. The sauce on this is just delicious and it is always fun getting your hands dirty cracking those shells open. The fried turnip cake is also good here as I like the lightly crisped skin with a hint of spiciness. You also cannot go wrong ordering noodles here but my personal favourite is the ho fun with beef and black bean sauce.

Service here is efficient and casual in a good way. The staff here treat you like a friend speaking informally and occasionally cracking jokes. Everyone is friendly and food gets to your table super fast.

The space itself is fairly spacious with a lot of seating. If you come by yourself or in a pair though they may ask you to share a large table with other strangers (it is optional) so do not be surprised if they ask.

House of Gourmet has become my go to whenever I am in Chinatown and want a casual meal. Note that this place can get loud when it is busy with the chattering of people and dishes clanking so definitely not a good spot if you want a quiet meal. Otherwise it is perfect if you want a lively environment with good food."
House of Gourmet	3	2019-09-25	"If you're out late night and want to grab some Asian food, then this restaurant is the perfect spot as it closes at 4am. We came around 9:30pm and the restaurant was pretty packed. You can't expect over the top service compared to other restaurants, but for a typical chinese restaurant standards, this restaurant is on average with it. 

We ordered their bbq pork/roasted pork and the black pepper sauce rice with beef. 
- Bbq Pork/ Roasted Pork: As expected, since it was pretty late at night, the meat wasn't fresh. The roasted pork was cold and the skin wasn't as crunchy vs being fresh. The bbq pork was pretty dry and was not juicy at all.
- Black Pepper Sauce rice with beef: This dish was actually really good which is why the ratings not as low. Since it was cooked fresh, the beef was tender and juicy, and the sauce tasted great. Portion size was pretty decent but for the price you pay, you only really get 3-4 pieces of beef. 

I'll probably skip this place next time if I wanted late night food and try out some other restaurants which were pretty busy as well."
House of Gourmet	3	2019-09-23	"I came to House of Gourmet looking for a quick lunch break from work. 

It's been quite a while since I had some noodles in soup so I decided upon going to a place I've known since childhood. Upon entering, I was seated immediately and I ordered a bowl of Beef Brisket Rice Noodle Soup. 

The broth was exactly how I remembered from my youth. Layers of flavour, while still retaining its heat. The rice noodles were cooked to a decent al dente, however the beef brisket was a bit disappointing. It was not tender and took quite a while for me to chew. I did wish they cooked down the brisket a lot more as any good beef noodle soup does require soft and tender beef brisket. 

The service is what you would expect at any quick service Chinese restaurant. You go there, order quickly, eat and get out. 

It's a great place for a quick bite from their wide extensive menu, especially if you're looking for a homestyle meal after the bar/club. This place has lot a bit of its mystique from its hey day but it is still one of Chinatown's prime spots for Cantonese food."
House of Gourmet	3	2019-06-26	"Fairly average Chinese food but open late until 2:00 am with lots of seating. They are located a block or so from from Spadina on Dundas.

Their food seems pretty average to me except for their char siu (BBQ Pork) on rice that is my favorite. Everything else is ok but with the exception of great wok hei. If you're looking for a quick bite after a night out this place will do since they open until 2:00 am and has plenty of seating. Their menu is fairly intense about 500 items and with plenty of seating for a big group. 

The food comes out super fast piping hot. Service is ok just need to keep flagging someone down, their table turn over is quick that is the way they operate so don't expect stellar service but they aren't horrible either."
House of Gourmet	4	2019-06-09	"My favourite 'after the club' meal!

I used to go here all last summer that the staff started recognizing me and my friends. This was when they used to have the kitchen open until 4am (2am is when they close it now).

I finally came back here on Saturday and the staff was all still so friendly to me, the food was amazing as it was last summer. There are so many items on their menu, whatever you're crazing you'll find!

The lobster and pork are probably my two favourite things from them!"
House of Gourmet	4	2019-02-16	"This place is conveniently located about two blocks from the Dundas St. and Spadina Ave. intersection. This place is big, and it is open til 2 am which is great.

I come here a lot. The selection here is amazing. There are at least 1000 items on the menu. Because there's so many items, some times it's a hit or miss unless you've tried many of them. So, I'll have to subtract a star to account for some of the misses. For instance, their steamed fish was over-cooked. And their congee quality is not consistent. Sometimes it is thicker, and sometimes it is watery

I'll say a bit about the items I love to get here. I love the clams with black bean sauce here. These are very flavourful. The clams are quite meaty, and the  sauce is not too thick or watery. These go great with a bowl of rice. The tofu pot with chicken and salted fish is also a great go to. The  tofu is nice and soft with tons of flavour from the chicken and salted fish. The last thing I love here is the stir-fried pea tips. The pea tips are not old, but are quite crisp with some light crunch. These are absolutely amazing if you have not tried them.

Overall, I'd recommend coming if you are looking for some Hong Kong style Chinese food."
House of Gourmet	3	2019-04-19	"House of Gourmet is a great spot for late night Chinese food with huge portion at reasonable price! However, don't expect anything extraordinary because you get what you pay for. 

On all of my visits, even ones at 2AM, the place was constantly busy so service always seemed so rushed. The restaurant offers a several options of typical Chinese dishes such as dumplings, fried noodles/rice, soup, etc. My go-to is definitely seafood congee! It is cooked to just the right consistency, not too watery or too thick. Seafood includes shrimp, fish fillet, abalone, scallop, squid and small pieces of ginger that really brings out the flavor! The portion for a small congee is super filling that will likely keep you full until the next meal. I've also tried their noodles soup with BBQ duck & BBQ a few times but it was meh. One time I'd find the broth to be too bland, and other times it was so salty. Other than that, the noodles also comes with generous amount at decent price.

Overall, House of Gourmet is definitely a good choice for late night food, but the quality doesn't really stand out from other restaurants."
House of Gourmet	3	2019-10-11	"Good for assisting in the time of need.....HANGOVERS.

These guys are open and you can order before 4pm unlike some nasty places who don't care about my suffering.

The food is very reasonably priced and pretty good too, a usual is the beef in black bean sauce which is solid and very filling...on the other hand the fried rice dishes are not the greatest and can lack a lot of flavor.

Good place just be sure what your ordering is something powerful in flavor as the more subtle options generally tend to fail."
House of Gourmet	3	2019-10-08	"Spontaneous craving for Chinese food but wanting to give other restaurants a chance in Chinatown led me to House of Gourmet. 

Portions are on the smaller side and they were decent enough to satisfy cravings. Wasn't much of a wow factor in my opinion. Ordered Yeung Chow fried rice, sweet and sour pork, beef soya sauce noodles, turnip cakes and snow peas for a group of 4. Topped it off with a iced lemon tea each."
House of Gourmet	3	2019-07-22	"(SKIPTHEDISHES Delivery Review)

My friend and I decided to order delivery on a Saturday morning. 
They have a HUGE menu and it was actually a little confusing for indecisive me to find something I could decide on.

We ended up getting:
1. Pork & Preserved Egg Congee: My friend really enjoyed this
2. Minced Beef Congee: The congee came to my apartment HOT (yay) and it was really well made in my opinion. There was a good amount of beef and I liked the amount of ginger in there to give it extra flavor (and it makes me feel 'healthier'
3. Dough Sticks: These were still warm when it arrived. Fairly standard but still a positive that it made it to the apartment without being soggy
4. Rice rolls with Shrimp & Soy Sauce: Never ordering these again. The shrimp didn't seem like it was fresh. The rice rolls were really chewy and plasticky instead of being soft and silky. For $7 the portions were TINY. 

For those 4 very basic things it came to about $27 (not including delivery charge).

I used to come here when I was really little with my grandma as her temple is right next door. I'd come back just to see how it compares in person."
House of Gourmet	5	2020-02-13	Food was excellent. Very delicious. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. The lobster was amazing. Very tender. Friendly and polite customer service.
House of Gourmet	1	2019-05-27	"This is my first and last time trying this place, here is why:
1. Service: I get it, lots of people come here for food, lineup is long, and not that many waiters, but when I was trying to order food, the server was literally so impatient that he kept tapping his fingers on the table loudly, I spent like 2 minutes thinking and he made me feel like I was wasting his time. This is a big NONO for me.
2. The rice noodle roll around fried dough炸两肠粉: for all the people on yelp who recommended it, I really think u should try more places for this before recommendation. I have never seen people put it in soy sauce, ITS SUPPOSED TO BE CRISPY and u put it in liquid, what is the common sense here? And the bottom layer of it was so soggy I didn't even know what I was eatin, mush or food. Then I took a bite of the top layer rolls which did not touch any of the sauce, the fried dough was so soggy and soft and then I suddenly understood why they had to put sauce on it ---- to cover the fact that they don't even know how to make this dish. DO NOT ORDER.
3. Two meat combo rice - roasted pork and roasted duck. When we asked them about the roasted pork, waiter said ""it's crispy"", it WAS 100% NOT CRISPY. I don't understand how do they expect people to pay for dishes with this low quality, I really don't get it.

I can find at least 3 restaurants which costs much less in Chinatown and still beats this place in every aspects, so if I were u, I would avoid it for life."
House of Gourmet	4	2018-11-06	"This is my go-to place for Chinese food when I am in Chinatown as the menu is expansive and price is really reasonable for the quantity of food. On weekend nights the place is usually packed with a small wait to get seated if you come in a large group.

I tried their afternoon lunch specials for the first time - Yeung Chow Fried rice and stir fried vermicelli. Portion sizes were great for $5.60 and comes with a coffee or milk tea. The restaurant was fairly busy to my surprise at 4pm which was neither lunch nor dinner hours. 

Overall I would definitely be back again as I like their wide menu selection and even picky eaters would find something they enjoy eating here!"
House of Gourmet	4	2019-07-25	My family was enticed with the lobster special while we were walking outside Chinatown. The server was very helpful to us when choosing our selection from the HUGE menu. The steamed fish was a great choice & so soft it falls right off the bones. I would've liked the fried squid to be crisper but it was alright. Dry spicy lobster with ground pork was also great. Not a bad stop at all. Not sure what the norm is here but white rice is an extra $1.50 for a VERY small bowl, so be prepared to spend a few more bucks if you want rice with your dish.
House of Gourmet	1	2019-11-23	Terrible service. Despite seeing my party, they continued to ignore us until we stopped them while they were walking by us. Food was cold and did not taste good at all. Highly do not recommend.
98 Aroma	5	2020-06-02	It tastes different. I probably should list it as one my my favs.
98 Aroma	1	2019-06-09	"Oh my God!! How did they get high ratings!!????? They had sectional sittings and some open areas. The place is dark for a Chinese restaurant. The decor is mostly wooden plaques and wood carvings. 

The servers or staff there were not friendly and talked behind your back. Yes, I understand Mandarin even though I spoke English to them!! I had to get up twice to get their attention and they only had three tables with customers. 

It's supposed to be fine dining so I had a feeling that the portion would be smaller. Ok. But why all the saltiness in your dishes!!! The veggie dish was pricey and decent. The shrimp fried rice lacked the shrimps. They were tiny!! The rice was hard. It felt more of a Caucasian dish. The beef and broccoli dish was the largest dish full of salt!! Basically eat and drink lots of water. 

I was obviously not satisfied or full. Dishes were TOO SALTY, even my friend didn't like them. 

Never will I go back!"
98 Aroma	5	2019-01-07	"Feast for two: came here for a casual meal and was so pleasantly surprised! Loved the authentic Chinese food here, and props on the portions. The atmosphere here is also good, setting is great for both friends gathering or family outing.

I strongly recommend getting the shredded Chinese cabbage with pork belly - it's spicy and savory, really hit the spot for me.

Also recommend the pickled Chinese cabbage with boiled pork soup. There's tofu inside, and warms you up as well as working up your appetite.

The shredded pork with garlic sauce and the spicy chicken with potatoes were quite good as well, tastes just like your typical authentic Chinese food."
98 Aroma	4	2019-08-27	"Great little upscale spot.
We ordered the shrimp pan friend dumplings which were bright and flavorful.  We also ordered the Kung Pao Chicken which was freaking fantastic!  It was more than enough food for two people.

Service was decent, prices were fair.  Standard beer selection."
98 Aroma	5	2018-12-22	"This is my favorite Chinese place for spicy northern food since Anne's Magic Kitchen mysteriously shuttered. I recommend visiting with someone who can read Chinese as the Chinese menu options are more extensive (sorry anglophones, you get a concise and diluted white-adapted menu)

I recommend these dishes: 夫婦肺片（a Szechuan style cold appetizer of sliced lung and tripe with sliced beef, drizzled in chili oil), 口水雞(if you've had drunken chicken, this is like a hot, super spicy and scintillating version of that) , 牛肉手抓餅（an elastic yet flaky Chinese pastry, kind of like paratha is shaped like a tortilla and either rolled up with layers of beef or another meat and served burrito style or sandwich style). Those are some to start with. Of course if you're feeling adventurous you can always just point to the next table who probably would have a hot pan with fish or meats in it, bubbling with chilis, scallions and sesame oil and try a lovely spicy northern Chinese stew. 

The first time I came here it was packed with young (and well off) Asians wearing high fashion streetwear and kpop haircuts. We got a table for 2 in 5 minutes and orders seemed to lag a bit and it was hard to flag down the server. But the food is indelibly savoury and makes up for the disorganized service."
98 Aroma	5	2019-07-01	This restaurant has a very dedicate environment. The bricks on the wall are very beautiful. The food was delivered literally within 8mins after the order placed. The owner is so friendly and considerable. He stopped us for placing more orders because the portion of the food is so large. Moreover,the price is good. Also, they have free delivery when you order more than$30 before tax. Great option when you considering to throw a party.
98 Aroma	5	2019-06-13	"Real good food, 10/10 would recommend 

All the dishes are in fairly large portion, we order 4 dishes and was enough for a party of 4.

Interior decor was good too"
98 Aroma	1	2019-04-07	"If I was able to give 0 stars, I would. This is probably the worst restaurant I've eaten at. 

We ordered 5 dishes, 4 of which were completely inedible.
- Traditional pancake: This was our first dish and was fairly tasty. No complaints here. This was the only redeeming part of the experience.
- Green beans with minced meat: It was too salty and too oily. 
- Kungpow shrimp: This is absurdly greasy and spicy which left our tongues numb. 
- Fried rice with pineapple and seafood: In contrast to the previous two dishes that were over-spiced, this was tasteless and (surprise surprise) oily as heck. 
- Lobster with ginger and scallion: This was the most pathetic dish of them all. We were served either a baby lobster that had not yet developed any meat, or they somehow threw out half of the lobster before plating it. On top of this, it did not taste fresh.

Sometimes terrible food can be saved by good service. Nope, not today unfortunately. The waiters were amateur (pleasant, and well-meaning but did not know what they were doing). They gave us a dirty fork, and when we alerted them to it, they took it away then brought it back and said ""we washed it for you"". 

You might look at my profile picture and judge me for being a clueless white guy. I went with a group of 3 other Chinese people who know food well, and we were all appalled at how this restaurant is even open for business."
98 Aroma	5	2019-11-02	Amazing food, really flavourful and especially good if you want some authentic spice. The interior is beautiful and really clean. It's really close to uoft so I come every now and again. Definitely my go to place nowadays.
98 Aroma	5	2018-05-17	98 aroma was amazing. We had our buddy Jerry take us. He is from Sichuan province in China. I asked him to show me the most authentic food in Toronto that he has found. He took me here! We got a little bit of everything. We got a tofu dish(better than I expected by far). A spicy beef dish (not too spicy). A cold chicken dish(tasty but the fat coagulates when it's cold and is like eating jelly). And vegetable soup(it had pork and chicken in it so be careful). The taste was 10/10 and so was the service.l, however I didn't do any of the ordering as Jerry ordered everything in mandarin. Very authentic. Very impressed.
98 Aroma	5	2019-07-06	Great ambience, great authentic Chinese flavour!if you ever want to try good Chinese food this is the place I would recommend, and more importantly, the flavour has been consistent since it's grand opening, not all Chinese restaurant dt toronto qualifies in terms of that, anyway, good place if u want to try great & authentic Chinese food with reasonable price!
98 Aroma	5	2018-08-10	We had the sticky pork stir fry with pepper and eggplants. They tasted like authentic Chinese food. There was only a few tables when we went there to eat around 12:30pm on weekday. I feel like the table is a little slick..? And there was a slight smell when you step into this place (this happened somtime
98 Aroma	5	2019-08-20	98 Aroma is a great place for authentic Sichuan food in Toronto. We ordered Fish in hot oil, fried potato and eggplant with green pepper, and a marinated beef appetizer. All were amazing! Very fresh, flavorful, and authentic. This is some of the best Chinese food I've had in a while. I highly recommend 98 Aroma.
98 Aroma	5	2018-01-22	"Really tasty food, nice decor.

We got mo bun, plus summer breeze salad, and original pancake.

Taste is fantastic, service is attentive. Would def come back."
98 Aroma	5	2019-08-04	Great authentic Chinese restaurant with a great variety of food, tasty dishes, and good services. In order to truly enjoy the breadth of food selection, you need to ask for the Chinese menu and check out the specials posted on the wall.
98 Aroma	1	2019-12-10	Inattentive staff, over cooked food. Noodle break right apart because it's so overdone.
98 Aroma	3	2017-09-01	"5/5 venue. Super clean (even the washrooms) for a Chinatown establishment and beautiful interior design -- traditional Beijing palace style! Super cool place to take a date or someone not so familiar with the Chinese culture for an ""authentic"" experience.......

But 3/5 food. Why? No major flaws with taste or quality, but unfortunately the dishes are just kind of boring. The regional cuisine served here is northeastern Chinese, which is my specialty since I hail from Shandong, as do the owner and some of the staff! I find the dishes very clean in that I feel that 98 Aroma uses less corn starch, oil, sodium, and possibly MSG than many other Chinatown restaurants.

3/5 value. Portion sizes are reasonable, but don't expect anything huge that would last for a week for under $10 like at House of Gourmet, etc. Pricier than most Chinese restaurants, but 98 Aroma can get away with this since they do have a swankier and more fusion feel. Think R&D, but with more Chinese-influence. A good place to take your Caucasian coworkers or in-laws, but not to dine alone just because. 

A few notes about specific dishes-

1. I've had the soups here before and the Hot & Sour soup is actually a huge portion even as a small size. The delicate mushrooms soup is not as substantial, so cannot stand alone as a meal.

2. Do order the Summer Breeze Veggie Salad (vegan) -- and make sure you MIX it well as all the sauce (and flavor) is at the bottom of the bowl. $9.99. Big portion, enough to share between 2 people or have as a lighter meal. I loved the textures and glass noodles.

3. Very mediocre Assorted Delicate Veggies (vegan). Broccoli, celery, carrots, and fried tofu. $14.99. Way too basic.

4. My gfs had the scallion pancakes, which looked more cooked and crispier than the ones my mom makes at home, but gfs enjoyed these. 

5. Can't remember the menu name, but gfs ordered a huge ass chicken udon stew, which was massive. They really liked the chicken and flavors here. 

6. Fried green beans with minced beef -- beans were oily and gfs weren't a fan. $13.99.

They take credit, debit cards at no extra charge. We didn't make a reservation for 7PM on a Friday night and were seated immediately, so customer volume is definitely not as high as it used to be a year ago.

Overall, would return, but only with Chinese food novices or for a special occasion."
98 Aroma	5	2016-09-05	"We made the trip to Chinatown specifically to try this place out, as per a friend's recommendation. Walking into this restaurant was literally a breath of fresh air. Maybe b/c it's one of the newer ones, but inside has such a imperial setup.  Mostly spacious with good ventilation and SEATS!! compared to a lot of take-out places in Chinatown. They even had a bar on the inner half of the restaurant with a marbled table that lit up orange O_O; Here are my top 3 favourites (in no particular order):

1. Summer Breeze (Signature Veggie Salad) ~$9.99 -taro crisps, sweet-potato noodles (Woo See in canto), leeks, bell-peppers, red cabbage, radishes, onions, and carrots that are all julienned! it had a delightful sweet-salty vinaigrette dressing. I loved this salad a lot!

2. Steamed Garlic Shrimp ~$18.99 I don't like shrimp, and I don't like chili oil, but this dish made me love both of it. Good quality shrimp with the heads attached (ALWAYS a plus), and the grated garlic was cooked and added this flavour that literally tasted like that delicious purpley shrimp paste in a jar you add to tung choy. Also instagrammable with their presentation

3. Pan Fried Pork Buns (6 pcs) ~$9.99  OH MAN THIS WAS SUPERB! Juicy on the inside and super crispy on the outside. Probably used dark meat on the inside because it had a resilient texture. Didn't even need to dip any sauce. 

Also if you like to eat spicy food, try the Steamed Tilapia Fish with Chopped Bell Chili ~$29.99
All my friends loved this dish and even threw in some e-fu noodles b/c the sauce was that good! Apparently it's the restaurant's signature dish too..  The dish was massive and heavy.. it took up most of the table lol!

TL;DR If you like Northern Chinese food, fine-dining, and affordable prices, it's worth the trip :D !!!!!!!"
98 Aroma	4	2016-10-06	"In Chinatown, there is a plethora of Asian dining options to choose from. Recently, I had the opportunity to check out the newly opened 98 Aroma where they offer refined Northern Chinese cuisine. The prices are higher than some of the neighboring establishments, so I highly recommend going with a group of 3-5 people to offset the costs. This way, you can order several dishes to share, as most plates are served with generous portion sizes and are meant for sharing. 

The outside may look unassuming, but the interior was designed to replicate traditional Chinese decor with its elaborate wood ornaments, and Asian-inspired craft works. The dimly lit restaurant sets a very relaxing ambiance, and there are several private booths available along with tables.  

The menu consisted of several popular Northern Chinese dishes like dumplings, scallion pancakes, and spicy seafood and beef dishes. Most of Northern Chinese dishes are characterized by its bold flavors, and dishes are served in big portions. So, you can expect both at 98 Aroma. My friend and I started off with the refreshing Summer Breeze Salad ($9.99) - a colorful mixture of sweet-potato noodles, julienne leeks, bell-peppers, red cabbage, radishes, onions, and carrots with a sweet vinaigrette. 

Northern Chinese cuisine is very wheat-based, so I had to order the Pan Fried Pork and Chives Dumplings ($9.99), which was very good. The crispy potstickers were filled with a generous amount of pork, and the chives gave it a nice aroma after being pan fried. 

Next up was their signature dish, the Steamed Tilapia with Chopped Bell Chilies ($29.99) - the dish arrived in a considerable sized bowl with the bone-in tilapia slathered in a rich yet spicy sauce. The fish was juicy and flaky, and the chili-based sauce complemented it beautifully. However, there were just way too many bones, so be extra careful when eating. 

I enjoyed the crispy texture of the Fried Salt and Pepper Calamari ($15.99), and it was perfectly spiced. 

Out of all the dishes, my least favorite was the Signature Chicken Wings ($15.99). Pricewise, it's pretty expensive for wings, and it was lacking in flavor. The peppers were sporadically spread out to the side, so it wasn't spiced very well.

Overall, I had an enjoyable dining experience at 98 Aroma. The restaurant was bustling with customers that Friday evening, and I thought that the wait staff did a good job of handling the customer service. Since they are a new establishment, there were two new waiters on staff training around that time. They were relatively slow, but it's understandable since they're new. 98 Aroma is a welcome addition to the area as they offer a more refined take on Chinese food, and is sure to please the people in the area looking for a nice place to dine."

Juicy Dumpling	5	2020-03-28	"Taste really good, authentic Chinese food restaurant.
Cheap and in a very good value.

Self serve.
Good for breakfast.

Sometimes this place is too busy, difficult to find a seat.

Definitely have to try."
Juicy Dumpling	4	2020-04-14	"We were in town for a bit of loligagging, so for lunch, my friend was interested in hitting up this soup dumpling spot. So we did and we came and we put in an order.

Both the steamed and the fried soup dumplings were really good, specially the crab and pork dumplings. The buns are delicious as well. 

Only thing I can ding them for is the temperature. I happen to like my soup dumplings destroy your mouth hot. That's how it served traditionally, this is how it should be served here. 

I enjoyed our little smash down here. Would totally come back and smash here again. Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope this helps with your decision making experience. Enjoy your awesome yelptastic day!!!"
Juicy Dumpling	5	2020-03-20	"If you want cheap and authentic dumplings, this is THE place to go! I ran across this place on multiple sites when searching for places to eat in Toronto so expectations were very high. And the place did NOT disappoint! 

Food - absolutely delicious. Especially the soup dumplings. 11/10

Service - fast and accurate. 10/10

Interior - super packed. Very hard to actually get a table. But cute layout! 5/10

I ate at this place three times while on a 5 day trip to Toronto, which simply speaks to how good this place was! I'm convinced this place is packed regardless of the time of day. There was never an instance in which I walked into an empty or partially empty store. I would recommend just taking out from here since it's so packed! But definitely stop by in Toronto!!!"
Juicy Dumpling	5	2020-02-10	"I think I have found a favorite place for food if you're on a budget, and also as a student! Located around Dragon City Mall at Chinatown, this is a popular quick eats place for delicious soup dumplings as low as $2.99 for 6! There are limited seats inside, and by the window, however since it's a quick meal, people tend to leave pretty quickly. Their menu offers a variety of soup dumplings, rice and also juicy fried buns. One thing I don't usually see in other Shanghai restaurant is pan fried versions of soup dumplings, so I definitely had to make an order of that. After ordering with the cashier, you will get a beeper that will ring when youre order's ready.

The food came fairly quickly after ordering. The soup dumplings are what youd get at regular Shanghai restaurants; super juicy and tasty!! I was honestly so surprised how delicious they were as I was skeptical at first due to the low price. The fried juicy buns were a bit small compared to other places, but for the price, you cant complain, and plus they were also very juicy inside as well. The pan fried soup dumplings were also surprisingly juicy as well as I was worried the heat from pan frying them would take it away. All in all, we ordered 4 things and the bill came up to be $16!"
Juicy Dumpling	5	2020-02-19	"This restaurant is SO hard to find. After walking around the dragon city mall numerous times, we finally found the entrance. 

The ambiance of this restaurant is very fast food style which is unique for the style of food they serve. As we wanted a light lunch, we ordered two pork xiao long bao and one order crullers. We thought the total would have been average for lunch in Toronto, but it was less than $10 for two people (as it's a light lunch) . 

Seating is a bit difficult to come by and it seems to be chaos since some patrons are not very courteous. This doesn't seem to be a new topic though since the location is small. 

The pork xiao long baos were better than expected, considering that it was only $3 and came from a fast food place. The crullers were hot and crispy- just perfect. 

This place takes credit card, serves hot food and is decently priced. I'd say that's a win. You won't be disappointed - order as much or as little as you'd like"
Juicy Dumpling	5	2020-01-29	"Honestly the best place to go if you're looking for something very inexpensive, fast, and still very good. It was quite crowded on a Friday night but people were coming and going fast enough that we were still able to find a seat. 
The soup dumplings were good but the pan fried dumplings were even better. Definitely recommend. 
This place is very popular and after trying it for myself, I know why."
Juicy Dumpling	5	2020-01-11	"I can not stress how much i love this place enough! Located on dundas and spadina in dragon city mall, this place is a hidden gem!

Dumplings are one of my go to snacks or quick meals and i really like the takeout joint concept. It's an ideal place to grab a quick meal in-between classes whenever i have a long day.

The dumplings are so good, so fresh! My childhood favourite is the steamed xiao long bao and it still is today, and this place serves one of the best ones i've had in downtown toronto. I've also tried the pan fried soup dumplings (basically xiao long bao with a pan-fried bottom) and loved them! I've been wanting to try more items from the menu but whenever I go here i always end up getting the xiao long bao for some reason.

They also have a wide range of sauces on the side so you can choose whatever you want to dip your dumplings in. Some of the condiments they provide are vinegar, soy sauce, and sriracha.

I also need to talk about the price. When i first went here, i was honestly so surprised when i saw the prices! They're super affordable (2.99 for 6 xiao long baos), which is a REALLY good deal especially in downtown toronto."
Juicy Dumpling	3	2020-01-10	"It's an interesting concept to see for fast food dumplings. It wasn't bad nor was it really good, but it was perfectly fine for a quick grab and go lunch. 

They all look so delicious, but when it came out, it was clear that it was either made hours before and reheated or just has been sitting out for a while..none of our dumplings were piping hot, and neither was the Soup inside the soup dumplings, which was a bummer. 

The fried chicken was hot and good, but we also ordered the mini sesame balls that tasted a bit like there was some chemical in there and it wasn't fully cooked through-- super gross."
Juicy Dumpling	5	2020-01-25	"6 soup dumplings for $2.99??? Crazy fast service? Seating indoors? What's not to love ?!

We actually passed this place after dinner but the low price of the soup dumplings was too hard to pass by. I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the dumplings. There was ample soup  within the dumplings, and you could get the soy sauce/vinegar on your  own. Well worth a late night trip  here!"
Juicy Dumpling	5	2020-01-05	"Soup dumpling central. This place has the works and everything was a pretty good deal. Easy to order at the front as soon as you walk in. 

I ordered quite a lot soup dumplings and pan fried dumplings. They also have soup dumplings that are slightly seared on the bottom which are different from the pan fried. All of them were so good. Comparable to the famous Din Tai Fung but cheaper. Walking in the slushy, cold snow to get here was totally worth it. 

If I were with other people, I would have also tried their cumin fried chicken, but that will have to wait til next time. If you come to Toronto and want cheap eats, this is definitely a must!"
Juicy Dumpling	4	2020-03-10	"It's been a while since I had good dim sum. 
My favorite was this place in Seattle (can't remember the name, but it's a chain out of LA) with my cousin. 

This place was smaller with a small menu. But the options were good and everything I got was delicious!

This place was packed! It's a small hole in the wall with very few tables. I was lucky I found a spot to sit!
The wait for my food was pretty long, but that was expected with how long the line was!

I got the pork soup dumplings and the chicken pan fried dumplings. Everything was fairly priced. The dumplings I got were really tasty! Hit them with some soy sauce and they're pretty good!

The pork soup dumplings were the best part! The chicken dumplings had a bit of an odd texture, but were still good.

Give this place a try!"
Juicy Dumpling	5	2019-12-15	"I can't even begin to describe how delicious these ""JUICY DUMPLINGS"" are! (Yes I just did that)

It was a Monday afternoon around 4PM in Toronto and I wanted to grab something small to eat while my friends wanted to grab a Bahn Mi. Not craving a bahn mi, I decided to go on yelp to find something small that would temporarily fill me up before dinner at 7PM. First thing that popped up for me was this place. I noticed that the prices were relativelyo inexpensive so I was skeptical on the taste. How often do you get to pay less for good food?!?

I ordered the Pan fried mini soup dumpling (Pork) for only 3.99 CA. Yes that's right. Only 3.99CA! The moment I took my first bite into the soup dumpling, I felt like I was in Heaven. It was a juicy, delicious, tasteful, and mouth watering soup dumpling I have ever tasted. It was just so perfect. I regret not ordering more!! My friend ordered the steamed mini soup dumpling and we traded one of the soup dumplings with each other. She also LOVED the pan fried mini soup dumpling!

The place was spacious but didn't have that many seats. Since we got there early-ish, there were enough seats for us.

This is a good place for a quick bite! Will most definitely come back here when I visit Toronto again!"
Juicy Dumpling	5	2019-12-04	"Don't let the low price fool you, those 3$ dumplings are worth at least 6$! Juicy made the perfect end to an evening, after having a few drinks at a bar nearby. Came her by recommendation from a local friend, and I'm glad we did! 

Arrived around 11:30 pm and the place was packed! Lots of people getting takeout but also groups just hanging out. We had to see what the 3$ dumplings were all about, and to our surprise, they were really good! They are indeed juicy. The texture of the bun is thin and chewy, and right when you bite in you're hit with the hot pork broth that is really flavorful! Perfectly bite size as well, so it makes it super easy to pop the whole thing in your mouth. 

We didn't get the opportunity to try anything else as I was pretty full from dinner we had not long before, but next time I'm in Toronto, I know where I'm heading for those late night cravings."
Juicy Dumpling	4	2020-02-20	"It's cheap, it's fast, it's dumplings!!

I can definitely get behind quick serve dumpling places.  These should be all over the city and would love to see them in more food courts.

I've paid way more for worse dumplings before.

This has got to be considered for one of the best cheap eats in the city."
Juicy Dumpling	4	2019-11-07	"LUNCH

Just finished eating Rasta Pasta and was walking by, when my eyes caught wind if the giant JUICY DUMPLiNG logo. 

I remember bookmarking this place for quite a while now and what true yelper can walk by a bookmarked place and not try it? Not one!

This place is the McDonald's of dumplings! Its fast, affordable and delicious! 

So glad my eyes convinced my stomach to try it out. I ordered the soup filled pork dumplings and it was honestly as good as the dumplings I've had at DTF in Shanghai. 

You guys gotta try for yourself, but imo dont order ubereats or foodora, you have to try it straight outta the steamer to get the real real, and that can only be accomplished in person! ;)"
Juicy Dumpling	4	2019-11-07	"Location/Service
This place is near Spadina, a slight off West of Chinatown. You can't miss the place cause there are big arrows and a large entrance sign noting where it is. 

Inside is relatively big, where there's good seating available and also a good assembly line to order and take out. 

Staff can speak Mandarin, okay nice, and very fast with orders (especially having a pager system). 

Food
Came here for a quick snack, which one of their top item is the $2.99 six piece dumpling. For that price, even if it's a little bland, it's justifiable. But to my surprise, the dumplings were in fact juicy! You can see clearly that the skin was thin, and when you taste it, it's packed with a good amount of meat and juice. They're not huge, but good enough to enjoy as a bite size. They also provide soy sauce to make it more flavourful if required. 

Definitely took me by surprise at this place. Although I didn't get the opportunity to try other items, but worth coming back to eat the dumplings (in fact, getting a dozen for the price range)!"
Juicy Dumpling	5	2020-02-20	"If you want something quick and fast, and you want soup dumplings. This is the place to go. They serve food like it is fast food but the quality is perfect.
You order your food at the counter, the menu is limited but worth trying everything. The prices are really cheap as well, and as for the quality, the soup dumplings were pretty good. 
After you order your food they give you a buzzer, as I would call it. You take a sit and wait for the buzzer to vibrate. You grab your food, get your condiments and bon appetite. 
So if you are in the area and want some fast soup dumpling, definitely check this place out. Will be worth your time."
Juicy Dumpling	5	2019-12-15	"This is probably the best restaurant I've been to in the past year. Hands down. 

It's cheap. It's somewhat fast. And have I said that I absolutely LOVE the xiao long bao there?? It's crazy. Mind you, I have the taste buds of a college student who usually cooks his own food (poorly); therefore, I see even a McDonald's as a delicacy. But for REAL the food at Juicy Dumpling is f u e g o. 

What I ordered:
  - S1 Soup Dumpings (6) for $3

I ordered 4 more orders after the first time I went.

Service: These ppl literally don't care about the customers but that's okay cus what asian establishment does?

Seating: Barely any but they pack all of the food in paper boxes regardless so it's easy to travel with them."
Juicy Dumpling	5	2019-12-03	"Food: 5
Price: $
Interior: 4


We had lunch at another fancier restaurant in the area - Asian Legend and ordered the crab pork dumplings, that is incomparable to crab pork dumplings served in Juicy Dumpling - the fast food place here.

The crab and pork dumplings here are soooo delicious, and at very affordable price point.

We ordered a regular pork dumpling ($3) and a crab+pork dumpling ($6), both are very juicy, and extremely delicious.. comparable to the ones we had in China, or New York's Spring Deer Restaurant.

Wished I had more room in my tummy to get more of it.

This place deserves a Michellin recommendation."
Juicy Dumpling	5	2020-02-21	"This place is magic. So cheap, and so tasty. Sorry Mother's, but this place just ate your lunch.

One really cool thing seemed to happen when I was there - someone came in to pick up an order, and brought her own reusable containers. There was some back and forth, I think about how they had been cleaned, but sure enough, they went back to the kitchen and out came her order packed to go.

It's more of a fast food type setup than Mother's, but there's a bit of seating, and you can sit and eat no problem. The menu's just on display screens, from what I could tell, but it had a good number of options. 

And the prices are outstanding value."
GB Hand-pulled Noodles	5	2020-04-29	"One of best places for Chinese hand-pulled noodles in downtown Toronto. 
In this special period, only take-out and delivery are acceptable. The quality of meat and noodles are always stable for delivery. Besides, they put the hot Chili oil on the side for you so you can customize it."
GB Hand-pulled Noodles	5	2020-02-29	"Tight spot but delicious food so still 5 stars.

Ordered side dishes of daikon and spicy cucumber and the plates were full and piled high.

Got a small bowl of lanzhou beef noodles (medium wide). Perfect amount of food with lots of flavour. Add your own chilli oil for your desired level of spicy."
GB Hand-pulled Noodles	5	2020-02-19	"I've been to GB two times now and it's one of my favorite restaurants in the world! It is a tiny restaurant but the food is absolutely delicious and is a MUST if you are visiting Toronto (I am an out of towner). 

The portion size is huge and the price is right. Honestly, you can order anything and be happy. There aren't many options but you do get to pick the size of noodle that you want. My boyfriend and I shared our dishes and they were perfect for a Toronto winter day. In the front, they even have the chef behind a clear glass so you can see him making the noodles! If you want good food and are visiting Toronto, this is the place to go. I can't wait to be back!"
GB Hand-pulled Noodles	5	2020-01-21	"GB Hand-pulled Noodles truly has the best hand pulled noodles in the area! Even though the place is small and stuffy sometimes, I keep on coming back because of the food. GB's noodles are made fresh to order and they are delightful - love the texture! I've literally tried all of the noodle dishes on the menu and I absolutely love all of them.

First of all, the beef noodle is great, the broth is so flavourful! It comes in various sizes but I think that the small one is big enough for me. I would say my favourite soup noodle from GB is the Braised Beef Tendon Noodles, but sadly they only have that on Fridays and weekends. They are pretty generous on the amount of beef tendon they give. My most recent visit was during my vegetarian week - so I tried the vegetable noodles with vegetable broth. It was pretty good, and it definitely still hits the spot even without beef! 
They also have dry noodles, my favourite has to be the pork sauce. Their pork sauce is very tasty (a little bit salty though, but it's perfect after you mix everything with the noodles!) and the vegetables they provide in the noodle definitely helped to balance it all out. Their tomato egg is alright too, but it does not stand out as much.
For all of the dishes you can choose your noodle type/width. I usually go for either flat or the widest one! It's also worth mentioning that for the price, the portion size is really good. Most of the time I can't finish the noodles except when I'm starving.
They also have a lot of side dishes - the side dish menu has really expanded since my last visit. I love the jellyfish and the seaweed salad!

Service is quick and efficient too, it's not the best but it's one of the better ones for fast-paced restaurants like this in downtown Toronto. 10/10 would recommend :)"
GB Hand-pulled Noodles	5	2019-12-27	"If you have ever craved noodle soup in any shape or form, you have to stop into GB.

There aren't too many choices here -- the majority of the menu is some kind of Lanzhou beef noodle soup. The only differing factors will be the bowl size, type of meat, spice level, and noodle thickness.

The broth is clear, perfectly seasoned, and the right amount of beefiness -- not super salty or thick like you would find in a ramen broth, and also not dark like a pho broth. It's such a good comfort food on a chilly day.

The noodles are hand-pulled, so whichever you choose, it's bound to have the consistency of freshly made noods. For those of you who like more chew in your noodles, opt for wider."
GB Hand-pulled Noodles	4	2020-01-18	"Special Lanzhou Noodles with Beef // GB Hand Pulled Noodles.
--
This place is really small, so there was a decent line  around noon. It's best not to come here with more than 3 people. At the front of the store, you can see the noodles being made as orders come in (I.e. you can see someone physically making the noodles). Pictured here are my friends extra wide noodles. I got the thick noodles (circular with a big diameter). I would recommend the extra wide noodles tbh, because the extra thick ones had a doughy taste when I chewed it since the soup wasn't able to penetrate into the noodle. The extra wide noodles have more surface area exposed to the broth, so each bite would be more flavourful! Also, they have extra chili oil on the side if you want to make it spicier! I actually found it to be at a good level of spice. Overall a decent portion, and they didn't cheap out on the beef."
GB Hand-pulled Noodles	3	2019-12-15	"I have to give credit where credit is due - GB Noodles is the restaurant that made me a noodle-soup fan. I lived in China from 2015-2017, and while I was there, I didn't find a noodle soup I enjoyed. 

GB Noodles changed all of that. I used to love coming here. It was consistently delicious.

I'm not sure what's changed, but it definitely isn't the soup I remember. It's still good, don't get me wrong, but after coming back for the first time in about a year, I'm just not sure what's changed. The broth is decent, the noodles are still fantastic, but the overall effect left me a bit wanting."
GB Hand-pulled Noodles	4	2019-10-08	"Decided to try this place since we've heard so many good things about it, and to see if its up there on my list of best beef noodle soups in Toronto. 

We ended up getting the mega beef noodle soup because it seemed like the best thing to share between two people. But honestly, if you were hungry enough you could probably finish it on your own. 

Noodles are hand pulled in store, and you can choose the lenght/thickness or style you wanted your noodles to be. We opted for the round thin noodles. The broth is nice and light but it still has body. You can really taste the beefiness. The parsley and green onion help cut through the rich soup. One of my favourite things here actually was not part of the noodle itself. But rather it was the chilli oil. The chilli oil was delicious and I probably finished half of the container by myself. 

Honestly overall it was pretty good, but it didn't blow my mind. Solid beef noodle soup and awesome hand pulled noodles. 10/10 would come again."
GB Hand-pulled Noodles	4	2019-07-25	"Tiny tiny place and hot as heckkkk.

They have fans running, but with an open kitchen, hot soup as their main sell, and small space with filled up seats of human body heat... it is HOT inside.

Service is overall good, but you do have to flag down the servers as they are busy. No biggie though since the place is so small, you don't have to try hard to get their attention. 

Boyfriend and I ordered the Mega beef bowl with flat noodles and spicy cucumber side dish. The food came out relatively quickly and it came out piping hot (yessss). The broth was a 3.5/5, the meat was a 5/5 the noodles was a 4/5, cucumber was a solid 5/5. The broth was just okay flavorful... but the beef was wow. so soft and so flavorful. Really enjoyed the meal overall. 

We really enjoyed watching the noodle master hand pull the noodles. We sat at the bar so we had good viewing of him stretching, pulling, twirling, and cutting them. Time to time, he gave the whole store a scare with him throwing the heavy batch onto the counter top so be aware that randomly, you will hear a giant BANG repeatedly (not for long though!)

All in all, great place to stop by! definitely recommend it."
GB Hand-pulled Noodles	5	2019-05-12	"Noodles made to order with your meal, that's awesome. It's a very small shop and so I was fortunate to arrive as a seat at the window opened up. This meant that I had my back to the kitchen and didn't get a chance to watch the noodles being prepared. I did get to *hear* them with the occasional loud bang as they were slammed to the table. If loud noises will make you uncomfortable, then get yours to go.

I chose the regular ""Special Lanzhou Beef Noodles"" in the ""large"" size with my noodles as narrow. Yes, you get to choose from super thin to narrow to thick, flat, medium wide and extremely wide. I enjoyed mine and would like to try the super thin next time.

The soup was delicious with a rich broth and the noodles were delicious. Not spicy at all, I added a good sized spoon of chili paste from the condiments at my seat and that kicked up the flavor. Delicious.

No beer here. They do have a number of vegetarian options.

[Review 11021 overall, 794 of 2019.]"
GB Hand-pulled Noodles	4	2019-05-20	"Come here for a quick, satisfying bowl of noods. We were in and out in 35-40 minutes! 

We both ordered the Lanzhou Beef Noodles. Delish! 
- You can customize the bowl size, the noodle type and spice level. 
- Size S is perfect for a good portion. Size L is massive if you're hungry.
- We both got the thin noodles and thought they were good but a touch too chewy (not sure if we should attribute to the fact we came so late).

TLDR; Broth was delicious. Beef was flavorful and tender. Noods too chewy. Very quick service."
GB Hand-pulled Noodles	5	2019-11-29	Love hand pulled noodles! Love that you can choose the width of the noodles. The bowls are huge! Super casual, just good old comfort food.
GB Hand-pulled Noodles	3	2019-04-07	"Cheap and delicious, two of my favourite words, accurately describe GB Hand-Pulled Noodles.

As is typically the case, places like this come with its sacrifices. For starters, there was a line out the door when I strolled in one Saturday for lunch with friends. 

We were eventually seated, though I found the tables quite packed together - they really maximized the space....to the detriment of comfort. 

The food makes up for it - I tried the thick beef noodles and they were some of the best I've had. Plus, you can even see your noodles getting pulled and freshly cooked.

But, before you're even finished your delicious bowl, you'll find waiters beginning to clean your table and dropping you the bill - you'll definitely feel rushed when eating here."
GB Hand-pulled Noodles	4	2019-11-15	This place is uber busy during the lunch rush, there's usually a line, though it does move pretty fast. It was also very cramped inside and difficult to maneuver without bumping into ppl. Other than that, this place had a solid bowl of beef noodles. I asked wht the waiter recommended and tbh i can't remember which one we got--it was a few months ago. But tbh id prefer mei nung beef noodle house in markham. I'd come back here if i'm looking for noodle soup dt.
GB Hand-pulled Noodles	5	2019-11-02	"Got there on a Friday around 12:30 so I waited about 15 minutes for a table for 2. Hubby and I split a mega special Lanzhou beef noodle with the picked daikon radish side and jellyfish side.

Broth is perfectly seasoned (I asked for them to make it spicy and to add green onions and coriander/cilantro). Broth may seem bland to a lot of non-Asians but it was just right because of eating it with aforementioned side dishes. 

The noodle makers scared the $hit out of me when I was waiting in line because they didn't start pounding the noodles until about 10 minutes in. 

Paying bill is easy, multiple card readers on hand."
GB Hand-pulled Noodles	4	2019-11-01	Wanted to try this place for a while went today in the afternoon and it was insanely packed got a seat and the stool and we can see through the window the gentleman making noodles in front of our eyes. I got the thick noodle beef spicy large which was massive. The broth was super tasty and the chilli oil was spicy but not to spicy. The noodles were soft and not gummy the beef was perfectly cooked and not chewy. The soup came nice and hot. Overall a wonderful experience and also it wasn't to filling as well which was perfect
GB Hand-pulled Noodles	3	2019-02-14	"This place is conveniently located a couple blocks from Dundas TTC station. It is also a block from Eaton Centre. The place is a bit crammed and a bit small, so be sure to give some waiting time if you are going at noon.

We ordered the special Lanzhou beef noodles. There are a variety of noodle options in varying thickness. The portions are sufficient for some people, but as I am a big eater, I wasn't full from the large. The noodles are good. The soup is a bit bland. And the beef isn't quite flavourful. There is not much memorable about this place, except that the prices are quite unreasonable with respect to the quality.

Overall, I would not recommend this place, but I haven't yet come across a good place for hand-pulled noodles to recommend."
GB Hand-pulled Noodles	4	2020-01-14	I was craving for noodle so we saw this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. We came at lunch time and there were a lot of people in the line  15-20 people, but the line move really quick so we ended up wait around 15'. Why I was waiting in line, I got to watch the people inside hand made the noodle, that was so awesome and how much work that put in to have a yummy bowl of noodle. We decided to try the big bowl of beef noodle. The noodle is really good, we chose the thick noodle and not so chewy. The soup was tasty and add a little bit spicy to it, it was so good.
GB Hand-pulled Noodles	4	2019-04-09	"This is a small shop located near my house so I often come here for hand pulled noodles. The portion sizes are pretty big so usually a small is good enough for me.

I like to get the flat noodle because I find it to be chewier which I like! The broth is also really nice. They don't have too many options though, so the menu is just pretty simple!"
GB Hand-pulled Noodles	3	2019-10-06	This was my first time ever getting hand-pulled noodles. The broth was lovely - reminded me of pho. I ordered the super thin noodles, & it seemed almost over cooked as they were too soft. I suppose this might just be because they're super fresh, so there's no way to make them more al dente. I found because it's hand pulled, the size consistency of the noodles were off. There were thicker noodles mixed in, so it threw me off. This is most likely all PREFERENCE based.. but the beef was GREAT & the flavours of the broth and addition of green onions and cilantro.
Hotopia Downtown	5	2020-01-31	"Be warned that if you come here your meal will be really spicy hot as their name indicates. Don't come here if you can't handle the heat. There's not much on the menu that's not hot - but for those that love that addicting numbing feeling of Sichuan spice then this is the place for you. The one dish I've had that's not spicy is their garlic pea sprouts - wow I didn't even know that pea sprouts was a vegetable that ppl ate but now it's my fav veggie lol. 

I see some complaints about the fish being full of bone and I also had that complaint previously  however they've since changed the way they serve the fish and now there are no longer any bones in the pickled cabbage fish hotpot.

This place is definitely one of my favourite Sichuan restaurants downtown. 

The service is ok, sometimes a slow...and service quality depends on who you have, the guy is a bit rude and most of the girls are nice but like who goes to chinese restaurants for the service lol  (if you do...well you shouldn't)."
Hotopia Downtown	3	2020-02-23	"Dining here on a Saturday night was a 30 mins wait on the waitlist for a group of four. There was a small waiting area so it wasn't terrible but heads up, the place is pretty noisy

We ordered the ""boiled clams"", the ""Sichuan Picked Flavoured Beef in soup"", and their iced plum green tea

The clams were def a hit and a very reasonable price ($8) we really enjoyed the flavour and quality of the dish

The beef soup sadly was a ""miss"", the beef shavings were decent quality but the taste wasn't enjoyable. Too many peppercorns were left in the dish and slightly tasted off ( I'm unsure if stale or...) 

Tbh the spice level is manageable and not over the top, I just found the flavour to be subpar for Sichuan soup dishes 

The plum green tea isn't a fave either, extremely sweet and diluted (tastes like a watered down freezie )"
Hotopia Downtown	2	2019-11-17	"I recently checked out Hotopia with my friend because we wanted to try their sichuan pickled flavour fish soup.  You can choose different kinds of fish like basa fish.  We ended up with Tilapia.  The pot that came was big enough for 2 to 3 people.  My friend and I didn't manage to finish the pot.  The soup was actually pretty good.  It was more sour than spicy, but I liked the mix of flavours.  The Tilapia unfortunately was overly filled with bones.  I was surprised by this.  The staff didn't caution us about the bones, so we ended up spending the evening spitting them out, which was not my idea of an enjoyable meal.  
Maybe there is an alternative without bones.  I would like to go back and check out other dishes on the menu.  It's a fairly new restaurant, and was pretty packed when we were there.  But service was prompt."
Hotopia Downtown	1	2019-11-08	"Nice staff
Simple interior
About $20 for king pao w rice; restaurants love to add $$$$ for the rice, they know it goes with rice, so charge more, seems unfair.
It is definitely hot. Felt like CRAP hour(s) later.
Hard on the stomach, I like hot, this was too greasy and doesn't sit well.
Did I mention 4 hrs later..
Not so good!
Bad aftertaste and guts are mad at me."
Hotopia Downtown	4	2020-02-02	Authentic Sichuan style restaurant in Downtown Toronto. The spicy level is more inclined to salty flavour instead of pure spicy one. In this case, it is more acceptable for most of customers. The two dishes we ordered are all pretty good. Personally I prefer the dry pot vegetables dish and all different type of vegetables melts in the dry hot pot in great harmony. Some tips: save your time if you join in the yelp waitlist before your arrival. It can at least save you 15-min waiting time.
Hotopia Downtown	5	2019-07-17	"This place has everything I want in a downtown Chinese restaurant:
-Genuine & delicious Chinese food
-Cool atmosphere and modern internal decor
-BIG portion with not so expensive price
-CLEAN and tidy

If you order any of the bowl, it is sufficient for two by itself for a price of $28-30. My girlfriend and I had so much leftovers at the end that it can be another meal later."
Hotopia Downtown	4	2019-07-20	"This place is outside College TTC Station and near many stores. 

We ordered the item with the least peppers, but it was super spicy still. It was quite flavourful. The pickled veggies added a nice touch, and the fish was tender. But it was too spicy for me. Of course you can ask them to try to make it less spicy. It was still yummy though so I'm okay with the spicy.

Overall, it's a neat place to go to try Sichuan-style hot pot with fish in Downtown Toronto."
Hotopia Downtown	3	2019-11-12	"I walk by Hotopia most days on my way home from work, and if you've ever passed by, you've probably smelled that strongggg spicy spice from outside. Maybe just walking by has even cleared your sinuses. It's been packed (usually with a line up) most nights when I've passed by which is why I've waited so long to check it out, but a few friends and I finally made our way here for dinner this past Sunday. I put my name on the Yelp waitlist for five people for 6pm, which turned out to be unnecessary as there were several empty tables when we arrived. (The restaurant got busy later around 7pm, and there were a few groups waiting for tables).

We have varying levels of spice tolerance between the five of us, so we ordered three dishes to share: pea sprouts in broth, steamed chicken with chili sauce, and the Sichuan pepper numb basa. The pea sprouts were the only non-spicy dish we ordered, and it was pretty standard as far as Chinese pea sprout dishes go (including the high price point). The steamed chicken wasn't too spicy and quite oily - watch out for the bones! The Sichuan pepper numb basa was the main dish that we ate with rice - it's definitely spicy, but not too numbing (as long as you avoid actually eating the peppercorns themselves, which I definitely did). There were quite a lot of pieces of basa as well as eggplant, and despite sweating and turning red from the spice, we found ourselves finishing everything. 

Service is pretty friendly, and they were fast to fill up our water (which we definitely needed). The bill came to ~$14 per person which was pretty decent for such a filling meal. This isn't my favorite type of Chinese cuisine as I'll admit, I can't really handle the heat. But I'm definitely interested in coming back to try some other dishes!"
Hotopia Downtown	4	2019-11-02	I have heard tons of good things about hotopia before this location even opened, and I finally got to try it with my friends. We heard the default spicy level (which is 2) for the mala pot is too spicy, but apparently my friend who told me that is a baby lol. I don't eat very spicy but this is definitely not spicy at all, I would suggest go for level 3. We ordered the marrying four pot, funny name huh, but it has beef sirloin, pork, lamb and shrimp, which basically saves u lots of decisions! We also added lotus root, beef balls, and rice cake. The rice cake was a great add on , it's crispy outside and soft inside, it absorbs the flavors and it's amazing! Even though it is not that spicy, I definitely think it is very very delicious, I would definitely come back again to try more dishes! We also ordered stir fry potato, it's warm and spicy, it's great!
Hotopia Downtown	5	2019-09-08	"Awesome! We had dinner in Chinatown & I was disappointed in the quality of the food. I am happy that we found this place on our last day. 

We split the Sichuan pickle flavored basa & it was outstanding! The fish tasted fresh & the soup was very flavorful. My wife loved the peach tea too."
Hotopia Downtown	4	2019-10-06	"A bit of a waiting period but the turnaround was not bad at all, we only waited like 15 mins-ish with 6 people ahead of us.

Good vibe, service was only okay because it took them too long to come around and take our order.

But the taste, IT IS AMAZING!!! Very authentic Chinese food downtown. Definitely recommend u to go try!"
Hotopia Downtown	5	2019-06-25	"Fantastic Sichuan food in downtown Toronto.

The new hot(literally) spot for some good Sichuan Chinese food.

Went for dinner with friends and ordered beef and tripe, Tilapia hotpot, chicken wings pot, bean sprouts, everything is delish and Tilapia pot the special is quite unique with Sichuan style pickled veggie. The dish has daily limits till sold out, we were lucky to have got our order in. But you do need to watch out for the fish bones because they use fresh fish instead of fillets (which is a huge plus if you want authenticity). The most popular dish on our table was the chicken wings however, the lotus root add on (some of the dishes are highly customizable) is to die for. However, it is really spicy, suicidal spicy. For folks who think they might be able to handle spicy, you definitely won't be able to. Ask the staff to really tone down the spice level to almost none, and it'll be spicy enough for like 99% of general population. Will def go back."
Hotopia Downtown	4	2019-07-06	It basically just tastes like a hotpot you can make at home without the hassle! I loved the curry fried rice - good flavour and portion for the price. Great service. FYI One hotpot thing is good for 2 people, so the price is alright for eating downtown.
Hotopia Downtown	3	2019-12-12	"I've been here once before and had a good experience. The pickled cabbage beef soup was plentiful for two people and we had enough to EACH take home for a second meal. Everything was delicious and I craved it everyday until I went again. 

The second time, there was barely anything in the soup and they forgot the pickled cabbage...the pickled cabbage that's in the name! I brought it to a waiter's attention and she had the audacity to just bring it out in a bowl, did not offer for the kitchen to add it to the soup and recook it. Very disappointed. At checkout they did offer 10% off without me having to do anything, which was nice. But still. How do you forget one of main ingredients?!"
Hotopia Downtown	1	2019-08-23	Horrible service. I used Yelp waitlist feature and arrived on time. We stood by the door for 20 minutes and nobody bothered to check on us. All the servers were chatting amongst themselves. No single exchange of words at all with their customers.
Hotopia Downtown	2	2019-11-01	Not for everyone, maybe an acquired taste. Had the Sichuan pickled basa as per other reviews and the flavours were just too strong. It would be nice to have a smaller portion version so new customers could try a wider spread and not feel so locked in. The single large $30 slightly tongue numbing, gingery sour soup was too much of a commitment for two people. Good initial taste but then it just becomes overwhelming. Definitely need a lot of rice for this dish.
Hotopia Downtown	5	2019-10-28	Best Sichuan food in town. But it always take too long to wait. Both settled and served.
Hotopia Downtown	5	2019-10-03	this is probably the best Sichuan restaurant I had in Toronto. You can basically order any dish from the menu, it won't go wrong.
Hotopia Downtown	1	2019-09-25	Poor service. Extremely slow. You have to wait for 30 minutes to be sited and another 40 minutes for your food. Will not come back
Hotopia Downtown	5	2019-08-25	Great place! Fabulous taste and clean environment! The fish is so fresh and with big portion!
Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant	4	2020-02-12	"I have never been to a place with king crab tanks all around the entire restaurant!  If you want fresh seafood in front of your eyes, this is the place!  So many options to choose from and between us 6, we chose the crab and lobster and they make it into different entrees.

It was a great experience and we had leftovers as well.
Some of the entrees were a little bland, but everything else definitely had some good flavors, sweet, and fresh!"
Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant	5	2020-01-26	"Another year has passed by and the HK-style ""Lobster Mountain"" is now back with a mix of fries & fried anchovies. This was a pleasant surprise as they did away with the anchovies/smelt fish citing rising costs several years ago. It caused a bit of a stir, but now the mix is the best of both worlds: east meets west fusion! Kids certainly don't mind the fries. So it's great when restaurants listen to customer feedback.

Fishman Lobster Clubhouse is still the place for the ultimate seafood experience at reasonable prices. With a reservation, we were seated shortly upon arrival. Made our order, and a big fresh 5.5 lb lobster was brought to our table for photos. The wok-tossed Lobster Mountain always impresses, not only based on presentation but also because each huge piece is crispy, slightly spicy, and still very succulent and tender. The other dishes also pair well: silkie chicken soup, snow peas, lobster roe fried rice and sea bass which were more than enough for our table of 3. This year dessert was even elevated with macarons; I usually find these treats overly sweet but here it was perfect. No wonder some people come to Toronto just to try this restaurant.

Occasionally, I hear complaints about their no-nonsense service. But they were very courteous despite the fast pace of service for Lunar New Year dinner. Our dishes arrived quickly, tea was replenished, full plates of shells were replaced. Even the leftovers were packed by a smiling waiter. Funniest thing was when another waiter with the bill offered to give us a toony for exact change. He even wished us well for the new year, just amazing service!"
Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant	5	2020-01-20	"My review for Fishman is long overdue.  It's been 3 months, and the food is still all I talk about.  

Located on the outskirts of Toronto, we arrived just an hour or so before closing.  It's a restaurant decorated with grandeur.  We had our hearts set on the fried crab legs with garlic (aka the renowned Jenga tower).    Everything on the menu looked delightful so we decided on The King Crab and Lobster Dinner.  This is a meal for 4, mind you.  And we're a party of 2.  We were warned by the young wait staff that it's too much food.  Lol, once you break the price down to per serving, it's definitely a steal!  Our waiter then confirmed with us that it's 6 lbs crab and 5 lbs of lobster!  They brought out the live shellfish for us to take photos (for the 'Gram) and also to confirm the actual weights.  

The king crab went into the steamed crab meat with salted eggs, fried rice, and the oh-so-photogenic fried crab legs with fried garlic (Jenga tower).  Both lobsters were used to make the HK-style lobster and fried rice.  Included with our gorge fest was the daily soup and poached snow peas with goji berries.

We threw on the bib, pulled on the gloves, and went to work.  Let me tell you...I would request this meal as my last on this Earth.  The crab legs were so full of flavor.  You see garlic pieces embedded into the shell.  There's also a complex melody of spices.  I found myself nibbling on the shells for the finely-coated batter.  The lobster was just as delicious, with similarly garlicky flavors and spices.  I would say the crab legs edged out the lobster as my favorite since the meat was so succulent.  The crab (knuckles?) in egg was just okay.  It was probably my least favorite.  The greens helped everything go down better.  (At my age, I can't handle as much meat as I used to.)  A couple of the waiters stood by because they offered great service, marveled at how much we've ordered and finished.  My tummy has never been this satisfied.  There's more where that came from!

You can only imagine how much leftovers we had.  Our incredible waiter packed the lobster and the crab into catering trays and takeout containers.  Luckily we were staying at an Airbnb, so we had access to an oven to gently reheat the trays of yumminess.  It turned into 2 more meals lol.  That's 6 servings of an all seafood meal for $388.  I'd say that was an excellent deal for an all seafood dinner.  You can feast like us even if it's been you and a buddy.  Oh, and don't forget to bring cash.  They took our USD no problem.  They don't accept cards!  

I'll always have fond memories of Fishman as the best meal I've ever had.  Plus, excellent service.  Despite being the last patrons, we were never rushed but we made an effort to leave as soon as we finished.  

There's only this one location in Northern America!  That's a crime IMO!  I'm still searching for a restaurant that's remotely similar to Fishman.  Please send suggestions!"
Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant	5	2020-01-18	"In my opinion, Fishman Lobster is the best Hong Kong-style seafood restaurant in the city. It's a classic and a must-try for Torontonians and when friends and family from out of town visit. 

The restaurant itself is a sight to behold with aquariums all around the dining area filled with massive king crabs and lobsters, fish, eels, and other seafood. The dishes are cooked family-style with many different options and most people opt for the crab/lobster mountain with fried garlic - a choice you can't go wrong with! The crustaceans are also broken down and served in several courses such as crab legs crisped shallots and chilies, and decadent fried with the body meat. 

The menu has a variety of different combos and you can also customize it according to your group with the help of the staff. They also bring out the massive lobsters and crabs for you to take pictures with which is always fun.

Prices are up there but it's seafood and can be managed by customizing your combos. 

Highly recommend and make sure to make reservations!"
Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant	3	2020-01-13	"Stepped into the restaurant and was surrounded by endless tanks of freakishly large crabs. We got the Hong Kong style lobster (4.83 lbs) lunch set that included soup, fried rice, snow pea with goji berries, and dessert. It was nice that we got a bunch of different dishes to try. We also had a lot of food at the end to take home too

Honestly though I started to get sick of the lobster after a few bites since it is fried and quite oily. I ended up eating the veggies/fried rice instead! I also find I prefer lobster fried with ginger and scallion more than HK style. Service was incredibly slow when we went.

Overall I think it was good to try, but I don't know if I would return again. I think it'd be good for special occasions or to treat people that like seafood due to the visual wow factor of the dish though!"
Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant	4	2020-01-03	"Don't get me wrong - this was one of the FANCIEST restaurants my dad has taken my family to. That being said, I feel as if I can be more critical of Fishman Lobster Clubhouse.

What I loved:
-The restaurant itself is filled with tanks showcasing live king crabs and lobsters. Makes sense, since customers come here for the seafood.
-Service lived up to my expectations. The waitress was even nice enough to bring our crab and lobsters up to our table, so I could take pictures.
-The fried crab legs were TO DIE FOR. The meat was so juicy and tender, and the honey fried garlic accompanying the meat offered a wonderful sweet-savory taste. Definitely a stand-out dish to order.
-Our family received complimentary macarons at the end of our dinner. 

What could be improved:
-Seating was cramped. Literally, there was no room for me to even pull my chair out, because the woman behind me was back-to-back against me.
-Considering my family and I ordered one of the set dinners, which came with a king crab and 2 lobsters... besides the fried crab legs, all the other dishes (fried lobster, crab fried rice, and steamed crab) were tasteless to me. Arguably, the fried lobster should have tasted very similarly to the fried crab legs, because the chef presumably used the same batter and honey fried garlic to season the dish. Unfortunately, the flavors didn't stand out as much in the lobster dish. Likewise, the rice tasted almost as plain as steamed rice. Steamed crab head is my favorite part of the crab, so I was so upset that the crab head was wasted in the fried rice. 

My family and I arrived around 5:30 PM, so we were lucky enough to find a table pretty easy. I will say, however, that the restaurant got packed super quickly, so unless you make a reservation or arrive on the earlier side like my family did, be prepared to wait before you're seated. Additionally, don't be surprised to find a lot of richer folks in the restaurant. After all, the price point at Fishman Lobster Clubhouse is pretty high.

Otherwise, a great place to enjoy some luxurious seafood."
Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant	5	2019-12-02	"419$ or $60 per person this meal is  SO worth it. Whatever the occasion! Always packed with people but so worth it.

Food: 4.5/5
Service: 4/5
Ambience: 4/5
Cost: 6/5 ---  yes it's worth it

We came to eat with 7 people and 420$, we ordered 25 pounds of lobster, 2 entrees, 1 vegetable, 1 soup, a tray of macaroons!! And 1 bottle of wine (which we switched for 10 cans of pop Cause we didnt drink)

We walked in to it being super full, we booked a reservation at 9:30 on a saturday night, we didnt even find parking lol. We waited another 20 minutes before we could order.

The food was perfect,  25 pounds if lobster stacked in a tower form filled with fries and lettuce it was a sight to see. The meat was great, although not very flavorful the large chunks of lobster made it worth every bite.

The 2 entrees came first, sweet and sour pork fresh hot and crispy, the beefs with vegetables was cooked beautifully medium rare. They made sure to serve it first because god knows we dived into that lobster as quick as can be.

Soup was okay and nothing fancy.

It come with a tray of macaroons!!! How awesome!! Although it didnt taste phenomenal just the worth it price of these makes it so much better.

The service was great, they come very often to change plates, let us stay longer just to chat after they closed and take our pictures, and went out of their way to explain everything!!

I really fell inlove with this place and I can really see how many fans they really have.

You dont need a lot of people to eat there, I see tables of pairs of 2 to families of 10 and more. 

Our bill came to 419$ for 7 people. I would say it was worth every dollar!"
Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant	5	2019-12-07	"Such an amazing experience! We enjoyed our dinner last night for my husband's 40th bday! The food was amazing! The layout of the restaurant was excellent with crabs and lobsters in fish tanks; like Red lobster on steroids! 

If you're from America, they only take Canadian debit/credit/cash or American Dollar, heads up!

We were brought or shall I say they dragged a grey bucket to our table with a 6lb king crab to get our approval and we chose three different styles of flavors. Then, they brought plate by plate our meals and it was sooooo much food for two. The style is family sharing like most authentic Asian restaurants! 

My husband and I did well, actually he did well I just assisted! This is a must eat restaurant! The veggies they bring are just fillers though, I love veggies but they were flavorless! So they remained on the plate while the star of the show was defeated!

What I loved was there were plenty of waiters to help at all time, they went from table to table to check on you. But, we had one whi looked as if he was a manager and he was awesome. He gave amazing tips on what to order and we were satisfied on our choices. He wore a blue shirt instead of a black shirt, so I'm figuring he was management!"
Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant	5	2019-12-12	"Put this place at the top of my list to try in Toronto, and it did not disappoint. The place is huge! If you have a large party, I would recommend making a reservation. There are so many options to choose from, but we went with the lobster tower (4 course meal). This includes, snow pea leaves, lobster tower, fried rice and dessert which was just macarons. The lobster tower was delicious! So much flavor! No sauce needed. The service was really nice, they came by and changed our plates and asked us what we needed a couple of times. 


Note: It is cash only!"
Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant	5	2019-10-29	"I love this seafood place it honestly was amazing I loved the food it was very delicious, a little messy but they give you gloves on the table, with some nutcrackers and crab forks.

The service was very good, friendly and professional, and this place is a lot bigger than I thought. They have lots of seating, an array of dishes and price points to choose from and overall the dishes are filling so come on an empty stomach!

I would highly recommend this place, but ofc be aware of the prices and look at the menu ahead of time. They have lots of parking at the back as well."
Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant	4	2019-12-30	"Overall: great seafood and service 

Little on the pricey side but worth for a special occasion. 

Food
HK style lobster: great flavor, meat was very tender, sweet and filled with flavor"
Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant	4	2019-11-26	"Came here with a group of my friends. This is definitely a great place to take someone who isn't from toronto. The mountain of lobsters makes for a great photo op! But not only does it make for great IG photos the food is also very good here! 

For a table of 8 people we got the lobster and king crab combo that was cooked in 3 ways. I definitely recommend having it cooked different ways otherwise just eating a 30 lb lobster just fried will get tiring and boring fairly fast. We got it cooked fried, steamed stir fried but I must say my favourite was the fried and the soy glazed one! So flavourful and yummy. 

They give you gloves to eat with so you don't have to dirty your hands. The food comes very quickly. Our table barely had enough room for everything. The meal also came with fish and fried rice. The fried rice was okay but tbh we were all too focused on the good stuff. 

We had a lot of left overs and the meal definitely could have fed at least 3-4 more people. It was a very expensive dinner. The combo itself was $1088 if I remembered correctly. 

Service was okay. Parking is a mess there! Definitely so early to get a spot."
Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant	3	2019-12-29	"Probably 3.5 stars. Overall, this place wasn't bad but I think it's definitely overhyped. It's known for its fresh seafood, namely king crab and lobster. Although you can choose the flavors, the most popular by far is the garlic fried option in which they fry the seafood with tons of garlic and place it on top of a mound of fries. It tasted good, but I feel like by the nature of the dish, it's hard to mess up. 

The staff also seems to be trained to upsell at every opportunity. The waitress persuaded us to order the crab/lobster combo which came with 5 lbs of lobster and 6lbs of king crab. When they came out to show us the live seafood, they claimed that they only had crabs that were 7.5 plus lbs so we would have to pay for the extra weight. 

The meal itself was good but nothing mind blowing. The soup and dessert (which was just macaroons) were very underwhelming. The crab fried rice also tasted kind of plain and didn't have much crab flavor. I did enjoy the garlic fried lobster and steamed crab legs though. 

They automatically add tax and a 10 percent service charge to the bill. They only accept cash and Canadian debit which is crazy considering how pricey the meal is - who carries that much cash around nowadays? You can pay with USD however it will be for an exchange rate slightly lower than market value. 

If you are set on trying this place, it may not hurt to come once. But considering a meal for four was almost 600$ I was expecting something much more memorable."
Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant	5	2019-12-03	"What an experience! When you order the lobster they bring it out to show you before cooking so you can see the size of the lobster. The garlic flavour one that we got was scrumptious. Just be ready to spend some money because food isn't cheap here but the quality isn't either.
We went on mother's day and they were giving out roses to all the mothers at each table. Such a cute gesture."
Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant	4	2019-09-09	"I'm not a huge fan of lobster, but if you are, this is the place to be. The lobsters here are ginormous.

We ordered one of the lunch/dinner sets for $299, which apparently feeds 4-6 people. That was an understatement. We had plenty of leftovers, especially with the Lobster Mountain in the mix (fried lobster with garlic bits, dried fish, on top of French fries). 

Dinner set included steamed lobster with butter and lemon, the Lobster Mountain, lobster over pea sprouts and noodles, lobster roe fried rice, and a large mouth steamed bass. The traditional steamed lobster with butter and lemon, and the monstrous Lobster Mountain were my favorites. 

Overall, we had over twelve pounds of lobster for lunch. Gluttony at it's finest. 

Like I said, if you're a lobster lover, 'tis the place to be."
Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant	4	2019-09-28	"We got the massive 600$ lobster tower that came with a soup, some veggies and a bottle of white wine. The lobsters were huge and it was impressive to look at. They fried it with garlic and onions and it came with fries. Although it was very flavorful and fresh, it became a bit boring to eat the same oily flavor after a few pieces. 

The place is huge and it's surrounded by aquariums with their fresh seafood. They show you the lobsters before cooking them. The service was fast and great. 

Make sure you reserve before coming."
Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant	4	2019-09-11	"THE place for lobster, crab, seafood.
I really like the deep fried garlic flavor for the crab/lobster and the hk style flavor is my next go to. The deep fried oysters are a delicious as well- the sauce is a little sweet, and the oysters are crispy n plump. 
The 4 stars and not 5 stars is because of the dessert macarons at the end of your meal. Personally it's a weird combination- macarons and Chinese food? Also they're not that good"
Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant	5	2019-09-01	"This seafood restaurant is touted as ONE of the most popular places to eat at, and I very much agree! It comes with the caviot that your wallet will take a huge hit..so be prepared to foot a bill between $100~$500 or more.

For context, my total bill came up to $500 and some change for the (E) item on the menu alone, and I came with a family of 5. It DEFINITELY fed all of us with some leftovers for dinner which I'm very satisfied with.

The atmosphere is very pretty as the walls are lined up with lobsters and king crabs in tanks. YOU GET TO TAKE PICTURES OF YOUR LOBSTER & KING CRAB OF CHOICE BEFORE THEY COOK IT! Very spacious restaurant, washroom conveniently found at the entrance, and tables are appropriately sized and spaced out.

Service was very speedy and kind. They often checked in on us to ask if we'd like to exchange our plate full of crab shells for new plate to eat on. Complimentary macarons as oppose to fortune cookies was a nice touch.

Food & taste. For the 1 item we ordered I feel everything was adequately flavoured. The ""steamed crab meat with egg white & salted egg yolk"" may taste slightly bland to some but I think it's a good dish to balance all the other seasoned courses. My favourite is definitely the tower of lobster meat with the spicy french fries!

The one thing that stood out to me above all else is how expensive most items on the menu are. It's not a complaint but surely something to consider when deciding for which course(s) you want to order for your group in the present and future visits.

OVERALL: I highly recommend Fisherman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant! Make RSVPs for your group ahead of time because it gets busy."
Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant	5	2019-09-21	"This is a restaurant meant for dining in large groups. The food is delicious and good quality seafood, with large quantities, depending on the option you choose. One thing to keep in mind is that the menu options are a bit on the higher budget scale, but the portions are quite good. The highlight dishes are the lobster tower, crab tower, and deep fried oysters.

Make sure to call in advance and reserve a table."
Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant	5	2019-12-30	I've been wanting to come here for many years and finally got the chance to this week. Expectations were sky-high and all I can say is that this place delivered! The lobster made HK-style was one of the best dishes I've had this year. Amazing! The soup, fried rice, and snow peas were good but nothing compared to the lobster. For two of us, we got the 6 lbs lobster package that was ~130 CAD before tax and tip. HK-style was $15 but it was worth it. The lobster came on top a bed of delicious French fries.
Tumi Dumplings House	5	2020-04-24	"A brand new dumpling house in the Junction? Yes, yes, YES!

I have to hand it to these lovely people, who opened their restaurant for business in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. I first walked past a few days ago and noticed that they had a spread of carefully folded take out menus packaged in individual clear plastic sleeves on a table just outside the door. I grabbed one and took it home, then after looking at the interesting array of menu items, I called to place an order. 

In the space of a few days, I have ordered from them twice now. The food is absolutely delicious - truly authentic northern Chinese selections made with wholesome, quality ingredients (yay Sichuan peppercorns and doubanjiang!) The dumplings are explosive and fresh, the rice and noodle dishes are scrumptious, and the portions are huge for the price! 

Finally, the man that works there is SO friendly and kind. The space is spotless and well-organized for clean, touch-free take out.

Please support this burgeoning restaurant! Their food is a welcome addition to the neighbourhood. If you are a fan of real Chinese home cooking, it will not disappoint!"
Yummy Yummy Dumplings	5	2019-11-23	"One of the best dumplings  family restaurant!!! 
We visited the place about 6 years ago and were super impressed with the food. That was the first time ever I've tried dumplings.
In October we were in Toronto and decided to visit this place again. We are still impressed with deliciousness and quality of the food. We ordered several different dishes and they all have been made for us from scratch -- handmade dumplings  are sooooo goooood!!!! If you are in town, make sure stop by that amazing family restaurant!!!!!!!!"
Yummy Yummy Dumplings	3	2020-02-28	"Went there because craving for dumplings and saw good reviews online. Their shop is a bit old style but that isn't a matter.

Service: Their understandings of English is really low. I know they're Asian but still communication is key especially running a business. Realized most asian restaurants nowadays required customers to write on a paper for ordering

Food: Food was delicious! Handmade and freshly made to order. Like the chewiness of the noodles and the thinness of the dumplings.

However, they gave me 11 dumplings rather than a dozen. I didn't give a tip because of the poor communication and missing food but they complained about that :/"
Yummy Yummy Dumplings	4	2020-02-06	"We came here as part of a dare to eat at a ""shady"" looking restaurant. Surprisingly well worth it. And NOT shady at all, very wholesome vibes.
 
They were located down the street on Huron, tucked beneath commercial offices. These guys have some pretty fantastic food. 

It's a very casual, family-owned asian restaurant, reflective of the cultural neighbourhood. If you're already into that type of thing and want to dine casually, it's a good call."
Yummy Yummy Dumplings	4	2019-12-19	"I've been on a dumpling craze for a while and I finally found a place I absolutely love.

Yummy Yummy Dumpling lives up to it's name. The store is located off of Dundas on Huron St (there's actually a huge sign that directs you to the store). It's located in a basement-like space and is smaller than expected.

The no-frills restaurant is served by a no-frills owner. She has very basic English but is understandable. The menu is quite extensive for such a small place. Vegetarian options are also indicated! You write the order # down on a paper and hand it in. So simple. 

The dumplings are freshly made & you can see a lady in the front window steadily hand making them. You can get them boiled, steamed, or pan-fried.

We ordered
1. Sesame Sauce Noodle: This was my least favorite and you can skip it. We thought it would be spicy but nope. This sesame sauce was thick.
2. Squid and Chives Dumpling, Fried; DELICIOUS. A must try. The crispiness of the dumpling was A+.
3. Chicken, Cabbage, and Mushroom, Boiled: YES! Since I don't eat pork and my friend doesn't eat beef - this was a great compromise. 
4. Cucumber and Jelly Fish: The jelly fish was a little different than what I was used to. The whole dish was really refreshing.

The price is great for how much we ate. I had left-overs for dinner the next night and they were still pretty good. 100% my fave dumpling place in Chinatown."
Yummy Yummy Dumplings	4	2019-07-19	"Handmade and made to order!! Can't get any fresher than this! 

This was and is now officially be the best dumpling ever. Just might be better than din tai fung! 

These were handmade to order! Have you ever had handrolled to order? Run by a mom and pop and their son. Located below a tall china town building and next to a sketchy massage parlor and popular hot pot place. That's where I found the best dumplings ever. 

Slower than most: everything comes out at different times. Cause they are fresh!! They have noodles and dumplings. Huge menu of dumplings: steamed, boiled, fried, pancake form. They got it all!!


Soup dumplings: the best ones I've tasted!! The best! Poke a hole, let the steam out and bang! Flavortown!! Super tasty!

The potstickers with shrimp and pork were delish. Loved the spicy cucumbers too. And their pan fried buns were so fluffy, it falls apart in your mouth! I got it with shrimp and egg!

Everything was so fresh, you leave happy! And not getting that sick after dumplings feeling: cause it's fresh! 

Cash only, never frozen! And pretty much the best thing ever!!!! Totally coming back!"
Yummy Yummy Dumplings	3	2019-09-22	"Cute family run restaurant in Chinatown.
Everything made fresh and speedy.
Food is okay. The restaurant is busy but not full."
Yummy Yummy Dumplings	5	2019-06-23	"Another example of ""don't judge a book by its cover."" Yummy Yummy may look slightly run down with its bland looks but the food and service definitely belies its otherwise plain (and dare I say somewhat sketchy?) looks. 

First of all, the owner of Yummy Yummy is a really nice lady. She helped pick out items for us when we were having a hard time deciding. It was like having a friend's mom cook for us! 

The food itself was authentic and tasted like it was made at home. I really enjoyed the xiao long bao and the potato salad. Pricing was cheap too! 

We ended up coming back a second time and will be down for coming back a third time. This place is a must-visit!"
Yummy Yummy Dumplings	5	2019-10-12	Finally found the perfect soup dumplings in toronto ! And yes it beats Mother dumpling and dumpling house. The place is sort of hidden away from the main Chinatown strip on dundas, and is located in the basement so I feel it's hard to find. But once you come here I don't think you'll be going to any other dumpling place. The place is owned by a friendly lady who greets you warmly and attends your table. We tried the juicy pork buns - 10/10 ! And the beef and shrimp dumpling which were also great ! But the highlight of our meal was the beef and onion pancakes - the dough is so uniquely amazing, haven't had anything like it in Toronto. Yummy yummy will definitely become a regular spot for me.
Yummy Yummy Dumplings	4	2020-02-29	Little family friendly run restaurant. Polite staff. Dumplings were amazing. Very fresh and delicious.
Yummy Yummy Dumplings	5	2018-11-11	"Omg.

This place was so good!

I was dying for some dumplings, so I covinced my friend to come join me here after reading some reviews.

Got here at about 12.30 on a Sunday afternoon and it was pretty empty.

We ordered:

Hot and Sour Soup (small, 4.99)
Pork shrimp and chive dumplings (9.99)
Mixed stir fried veggies (7.99)
Beef rolled pancake (9.99)


The soup was average fare, a bit thick

The dumplings were freaking fantastic. The shrimp inside were cooked perfectly. Some of the best I've had in a really long time and they hit that spot.

The veggies were cooked perfect and fresh.

The beef rolled pancake was phenomenal, but super greasy as expected.

By the time our food came though, the restaurant was super packed so that's a great sign! 

Portions were huge and we had tons to take home. 

I can defo see this becoming my go to spot in Chinatown!"
Yummy Yummy Dumplings	3	2019-04-19	"Well, this was a good place to me after the owner said I have to pay 10% tip? 

This is not a full service restaurant, I actually had to go to the cashier to pay my bill so I wouldn't understand why I have to pay 10%?

My bill was 37.32 and I have her $40，and I asked her kept the changes and she said it's not enough? 
It's totally ridiculous! I wouldn't care if the food good or not. It's really pricey as well."
Yummy Yummy Dumplings	1	2018-09-30	"I was craving soup dumplings and this restaurant has such good reviews that I just had to come here. It's a tiny restaurant down some steps, so it might be hard at first to find if you don't know what you're looking for exactly. There isn't a ton of seats, so if it's busy, you might need to wait for a table.

The restaurant itself could use a huge facelift. The washrooms were dirty and very small. The whole place just feels outdated - minus the tables and chairs. I came on a busy Saturday night but was seated fairly quickly. They cleaned my table before I was seated but the dish cloth they used to wipe the table was definitely used.. my table just smelled like a used dish cloth, sadly.
There were also a TON of mosquitos. We were seated right in front the of door, so perhaps this could be why.. but the most odd thing is that they would just drop onto our table and food, and almost die or stop moving instantly. Not sure what was going on.. but it ruined my appetite. 

ONTO THE FOOD: the most important reason why I'm reviewing! We ordered the Juicy Pork Dumplings (soup dumplings), fried shrimp & pork dumplings, & chive pancakes. The soup dumplings were just okay. The filling wasn't as flavourful as other ones that I've tried from other places. It was missing something but I can't figure out what it is. The pancakes were really good, and I wish I ate more but they were dripping I grease, so I couldn't eat more than 2. I didn't have any of the fried dumplings but my boyfriend said they were very greasy as well. We actually had to go get a drink from a bar close by just to get rid of the greasy feel in our mouths.

I honestly wouldn't come back here myself. A lot of other people gave this place high reviews so I'm not sure if I just had a bad experience or not. But the greasy food and mosquitos flying around or dropped dead in front of us wasn't acceptable."
Yummy Yummy Dumplings	3	2019-10-22	Apparently closed today Tuesday Oct 22 at 5pm. Sign says closed Wednesday so I'm not sure what's going on
Yummy Yummy Dumplings	5	2019-05-25	"This place is great! Very authentic and delicious dim sum. We got the soup dumplings, pan friend dumplings, fish ball soup and egg drop soup. 

Everything was amazing, very flavourful and the service was quick. 

I highly recommend this place, especially the soup dumplings."
Yummy Yummy Dumplings	4	2018-08-24	"I was meeting up with a friend for lunch. I let her pick where to eat; she settled on Yummy Yummy Dumplings, which is one of her go to spots for dumplings.

We dropped in on a Tuesday afternoon (around 12:00pm). It was pretty dead but apparently, it's sporadic whether they're busy or not. The good thing is that they make everything fresh. You can see straight into the kitchen all the food being made. When you sit down, you'll be offered hot or cold tea. I also asked for water which came out nice and cold.

The menu is long with soups, appetizers, hot dishes, steamed buns, dumplings, pancakes, noodles, rice & congee and frozen dumplings/buns. Nice to see that dumplings are all the same price whether you get them boiled, steamed or pan fried.

- Rolled beef pancakes (F20) ($8.99) - green onions and slices of beef. Interestingly, they come cut into four pieces and wrapped in tin foil. Never seen that before. Good but the sauce was a tad sweet. 
- Xiao long bao (D01) ($7.99 for 6) - these aren't your usual XLB's. Labelling it as an XLB is pretty misleading. It's more so a small steamed bun. It was still good! Tasty filling and soft, fluffy bun. 
- Pork & cabbage (E05) ($8.99 for 10) - we got these pan fried. Excellently cooked.

Good little hole in the wall dumpling spot."
Yummy Yummy Dumplings	4	2019-09-22	"Handmade? Check. Made to order? Check. Unassuming decor hiding a mouthwatering culinary experience? Yes! 

Better than Din Tai Fung, This wonderful spot is a little subterranean hole in the wall that simply exudes quality and love. Like I said these dumplings are made to order and it shows! They have a wide array of dumplings, along with the usual stuff that you would expect such as scallion pancakes and some noodle dishes (both scrumptious). 

Can't wait until I'm back in the 416 so I can go to yummy yummy dumplings!"
Yummy Yummy Dumplings	4	2019-04-06	"We came on a Thursday night for dinner. The restaurant is quite small and it is on a basement level, we walked down stairs to get to the front entrance. There were a few tables occupied but many tables still empty so we didn't have to wait.

The restaurant has plain decor and they haven't done much in terms of upgrading furniture and renos, it's quite bare-bones. The menu has a wide selection of various dumplings, buns, and appetizers. To order you write down your menu item number on a piece of paper and give to the waiters. 

We ordered pork steamed dumplings, fried chicken dumplings, fried pork puns, and green onion pancakes. The dumplings were filled nicely with the meat and were quite large. For two people, we ordered more than enough and were very full. I loved the fried pork buns - they were juicy and fried just right at the bottom. I think the food is a little on the expensive side - it averages out to almost $1 per dumpling but for the quality and taste it's worth it. 

Overall a great little family owned shop in Chinatown to get your fill of dumplings. It's generous on the fillings of the dumpling and very flavourful. Yummy indeed!"
Yummy Yummy Dumplings	4	2018-12-16	"This was the best food I've had in Toronto in my entire trip. I came where with my friends on a Friday afternoon and we had the whole place to ourselves for some time which felt pretty good.

We ordered several different types of dumplings, soup, pancake and soy milk, everything was YUM. In fact, we got so carried away by the wonderful items in the menu that we ordered more than we could eat.

It seemed like a family owned place and the staff treated us very well. Despite ordering an enormous amount of food, everything was served quickly and tasted good.

Reducing one star because at the end of a wonderful lunch, they refused to accept credit card even though there was a credit card sign outside. They said that their machine wasn't working but based on other reviews, it seems that they haven't been accepting credit card for a while. We were not from the country and had to go out looking for ATM to get cash. They did say they'll accept US dollar but without the exchange rate conversion which felt like a scam.

Everything else here was wonderful except for the last part about cash only payment."
Yummy Yummy Dumplings	5	2019-11-09	"This food was so ""yummy"", pun intended. We ordered the shrimp dumplings (steamed) and were not expecting them to be so full of flavor. A tiny, clean, hidden gem- pushed back from the hustle and bustle of the main road. Would highly recommend!"
Yummy Yummy Dumplings	3	2020-02-09	The service was great, but the quality of the food was pretty mediocre. Tried 4 different kinds of dumplings - neither of them were bad, but didn't stand out either.
Zhang’s Kitchen	4	2020-01-28	"Got the chance to try out Zhang's Kitchen and it was pretty good! We went early in the afternoon so we were the only ones in the restaurant; however there were a couple of people doing take out. 

The interior of the restaurant is very clean and simple and I was super impressed! The staff are friendly and attentive. I enjoyed how they served warm water infused with lemon - perfect on a cold winter day. We sat down and you order using the paper menu. We got the small braised beef brisket with noodle, the braised beef noodles (with soup) and the spicy sliced beef cold dish. You can customize your order and I added some quail eggs and bok choy and they don't skimp on the quantity!

The dishes arrived quickly and the portions were huge! There were large chunks of meat and the noodles were well cooked and flavourful. I particularly liked the spicy sliced beef. Overall, it was a very pleasant and filling meal and would swing by again if in the area."
Zhang’s Kitchen	3	2020-03-14	"One cold winter afternoon... hungry... cold... wandering mindlessly downtown, I stumbled upon Zhang's Kitchen tucked in the southern side of Elm Street. 

The restaurant itself is not big and I arrived late afternoon. An eerie quietness besets the restaurant. After settling down they started putting on some mandarin pop songs and handed over water and the paper menu.  Service was courteous and efficient. 

Menu wise is extremely limited here, they specialize in yellow braised dishes.  I chose yellow braised chicken with thick noodles; a fine choice for a frigid day. The sauce that was reduced and used to braised the chicken was excellent. The simple flavours created by the cooking wine, ginger, scallion, leek, and other ingredients was delicious and would warm any stomach or heart.  The chicken was equally done well. The chicken was fall off the bones texture (even though their chicken was bone-less) without giving any feeling of it being overcooked. 

What prompted a less than four star when everything sounded great? A few things... first the noodles lacked texture. They were pretty limp and felt like overcooked store bought versions. The mushroom that was added to the dish were the wet variety and the flavour of the mushroom failed to transfer to the sauce. They also added strings of green pepper on top of the dish for aesthetic purposes. This may be a personal thing but I hate when green peppers become fully cooked (while not having been grilled). 

Overall score for Zhang's Kitchen is a solid 3.4. Unless they work on their noodles, you may want to stick with rice."
Zhang’s Kitchen	5	2019-12-13	"This place is amazing. I ordered the beef brisket noodle. The noodle had great texture and the brisket was super tender and soft. I got a small size and it was the right amount as i was pretty stuffed afterwards.

The server was very attentive and polite.
They are also doing 10% off if you pay cash as part of their grand opening.

Its a very chill vibe inside. I'd definitely come back and would recommend others to try it."
Zhang’s Kitchen	4	2019-11-27	"This Chinese restaurant focuses on Shangdong (in north eastern China) cuisine. It just opened on 2019-11-25. It is currently in soft opening So all food items are 10% off.

They are considered a fast food restaurant where you customize you own bowl with a protein (braised boneless chicken, braised pork rib, braised beef brisket), choose rice or noodles, choose the spiciness level, and then add-ons at $1.99 each.

All bone broths have no MSG and are made freshly each day. Some food may contain wheat, peanut and/or sesame.

There are also bowls of noodle dishes (4 options) and spiciness level.

There are also cold appetizer dishes and drinks including a delicious Chinese Herbal Tea.

The speed of preparation is good for students, takeout, or delivery.

The staff are all very courteous. 

The restaurant interior is modern, bright and clean. There is free WiFi."
Zhang’s Kitchen	4	2019-12-09	"I heard the buzz of this new joint and just had to check it out. I was darn skeptical... since it was completely empty at 6pm~ on a Saturday night. 

But hey! It's their soft opening... so gave it a go and was pleasantly surprised with their delicious braised beef noodle. Very satisfying, came in a thick savory sauce (curry consistency) and juicy beef chunks.  The potatoes were a nice touch along with the noodles that just soaks up the sauce. In the end, my belly was super happy. More places need to do braised beef noodles like this! Next time I'll definitely come back and try their soup noodle, but with their stir fry saucy noodle stealing the show, hard to say the soup noodle would be as good.  

We also ordered a side garlic broccoli and loved the tangy garlic sauce that it came with, so appetizing and just made me crave for it more. The sauce was probably some kind of Chinese vinegar, sugar and garlic concoction but when I tried doing it at home couldn't get it quite right. 

Service was just alright gotta ask to get water-filled and decor is whatever - clean. Though they forgot we added extra bok choy in one order. Instead of just going in the kitchen and getting some bok choy on the side, they took the whole bowl of noodle and cooked and added it in... what a tease, especially when you're hungry and you want to eat and have to wait again. But hey I don't expect much from a casual Chinese restaurant. 

Ps - they still offer 10% off with cash."
Zhang’s Kitchen	4	2019-12-09	"New chinese restaurant near Ryerson, so if you're studying or working nearby and looking for some legit chinese food here's another option without having to make a journey to the west.

Nice interior. Brightly lit.
Not accessible however: stairs to get up to the restaurant, and then stairs to get to washrooms on the second floor. They offer delivery however, so that can be a solution.

They specialize in braised meat with noodles or rice. Tried to get the braised beef but they were out for the night, so settled with braised pork ribs with noodles.

Portion size was pretty good. They offer small and large sizes, but I'm not sure how much smaller the small is. Decent amount of meat (like, a dozen pieces!)

An enjoyable meal. Check it out."
Zhang’s Kitchen	4	2020-02-15	Stopped by this place on a weeknight for a quick bowl of noodles and wasn't disappointed. The interior is simple and clean while service was average. This place specializes in braised meats (chicken, pork ribs, beef brisket) served over noodles or rice. Their braised chicken is comparable to Yang's braised chicken and was very tender. FYI their medium spice wasn't that spicy (and I'm normally a mild spice kind of girl). The portion sizes are fair (get a large if you're a meat eater) but it could be quite expensive if you want to add on veggies or other toppings. I don't really recommend the pork ribs because it was pretty dry and flavorless. The noodles and broth were delicious and reminded me of what I usually get at Hey Noodles.
Zhang’s Kitchen	5	2020-03-06	Delicious braised beef brisket with rice (large).   Soaks up the sauce nicely.  4 different spice levels. I choose Mild.  $15.99 for a large.  Amazing lunch for a cold winter day.  Clean restaurant.
Zhang’s Kitchen	3	2020-02-29	Decent noodles with lots of meat.  I definitely enjoyed the noodles so I'd say it's worth a try.
Zhang’s Kitchen	3	2019-12-24	Service is very good...friendly ambiance but I'm sorry, I just did not taste the authentic chinese food that I want.  Maybe they are just giving a modern twist but not for me.  Also, the meat are so thinly sliced for the price it should have more than that.  It just my taste and maybe some people will not agree.
Chop Chop	5	2020-05-13	"fried rice: it was really good and not too oily. It doesn't make you feel heavy at all. Not too salty and not too oily so you can keep eating without getting sick and tired of it.

Sweet and sour soup: the soup was good, since we ordered the noodle and rice, it was a good portion for the two of us

noodles: I don't quite remember how the noodles tasted sorry haha but I just remember everything being really good

servers are really nice :)"
Chop Chop	4	2019-06-28	"Great place for affordable comfort Chinese food! Might get a bit packed though.

We've ordered green beans, noodles, and a bunch of stuff (I don't remember quite frankly) but the food was quick, fresh, and hot! 

Will definitely  come back :)"
Chop Chop	4	2018-11-06	"Summary: clean, classy, classic vibe restaurant serves tasty Chinese food!


It was pretty quiet on a Thursday at 12:30 pm. I was content seeing the minimalist look and classic blue white dishware - it honestly reminded me of my childhood.

The lady at the counter recommended the General Tao chicken but I was on a budget and the chicken didn't come with rice (rice is $2 a bowl)... Plus I had my heart set on getting the green onion pancake as an appetizer, so I went with that plus the braised beef noodles.

The green onion pancakes came first and were quite good. They split into an outer and inner rim. The outer rim has plentiful green onions... Tasty!

The braised beef noodles came after - medium mild width was perfect for me (I'm very particular about the size of my noodles), there was a solid amount of meat and it was mostly tender, and the noodles were perfectly al dente! In addition to chunks of meat there is also a bit of shredded pieces of the beef as you dive into the meal... Delicious!

The meal comes with a white rabbit candy after.

Solid experience!"
Chop Chop	2	2019-04-05	We ordered through Uber eats. The driver was quick and really friendly. The food was hot and not too expensive. Otherwise the food was not our favorite. Out of everything we enjoyed the spring rolls the best. The rest of the food was pretty bland and not a lot of flavor. It was fulfilling and we were hungry so it wasn't the worst thing.
Chop Chop	4	2019-01-07	"I've had my eye on this place for a while and it definitely met my expectations. It's a cute little family-owned restaurant. It had giant windows and clean decor. It was surprisingly empty on a Saturday afternoon. The servers were very friendly and attentive. 

I loved that the menu was simple and straightforward, so we weren't overwhelmed by too many choices. We ordered the braised beef noodles ($12 - they've raised the price from previously posted menus). We also got an order of pan fried dumplings to share ($9). We were really happy with everything we ordered. 

The prices are a little steeper than what you'd find in Chinatown, but their noodle portions were quite large and they gave an ample amount of beef. The restaurant was also much cleaner than the ones in Chinatown. 

I'd definitely make the trip back to try their other dishes!"
Chop Chop	4	2018-08-30	"This is probably one of my favourite Chinese restaurants in the area! It's a cute little place that serves pretty good portions of delicious dishes at an okay price (slightly more expensive but worth it). My go-to dishes are always the Shanghai noodles and the green beans, which are both SO GOOD. Also, the dishes here aren't greasy but still taste amazing! 

Unfortunately, they don't have A/C so it is slightly hot especially during the scorching summer days, but honestly we were too busy studying our mouths with noodles to complain. 

If you're in the area, give Chop Chop a try and I guarantee that soon you'll find yourself craving it and coming in regularly."
Chop Chop	3	2018-12-10	"Let me first say that I was walking into this restaurant expecting to give this place a 4-star (if not 5-star review). I was skeptical of the reviews that rated this place under 4-stars because of raving reviews from co-workers of mine. However, that co-worker went to this place the Friday before I came and also deemed the quality has declined. So maybe it is worthwhile reading on my review as to why that's the case.

My friend and I ordered three things so i'll describe each item below- starting with the best.

1. Green beans- if all the other food was as good as this one, I would've given this place a 4-star review. Fresh, flavorful, and on-point. The wringly green beans stir-fried into the peppers and mushrooms were fantastic. However, this was a very small plate for it to cost $11. Quality: 4.5/5. Price for the food amount: 3/5.

2. Fried rice- this was their featured fried rice and a recommendation from the co-worker. I'm not a fried rice person to begin with but chose this because of the rec. This was just fried rice I could get at any chinese restaurant in chinatown for probably 75% of this cost. It was a lot but not memorable. Quality: 3.5/5. Price for the food amount: 4/5 

3. Boiled pork and chive dumplings- having chosen the healthier version of the dumpling options (versus fried), these turned out to be the most disappointing meal here. The dough/skin of the dumpling was very thick (and this is my greatest fear). The ratio of meat to skin was probably 1:2.5. Quality: 2/5. Price for the food amount: 3/5. You can get the same dumplings but WAYYYYYY better at dumpling house in Chinatown. Thank me later and go there.

So in conclusion, if you're looking for the hype of this place that came from BlogTO or other reviewers, this place will not meet your standards. I would go elsewhere for chinese food- specifically Chinatown; unless you want the aesthetics and hip vibe, then this place got that nailed down."
Chop Chop	5	2018-05-19	"Update: I came back to try the General Tsao chicken and the vermicelli noodles as promised. 

The chicken was AMAZING - it was crispy but not over fried, and there was just the right amount of sauce. I would definitely reorder this!

The vermicelli portion size was huge, we ended up taking most of it home. It was also pretty good! The shrimp wontons were crispy and great as well. 

I love the atmosphere of this place, the high ceilings and ceiling windows make this place look bright and modern. They also have a patio! I will keep coming back here for sure."
Chop Chop	4	2018-05-19	"As a Taiwanese person, I have to say, this place is by no means authentic. However, there's nothing wrong with that. 

I ordered the Taiwanese beef noodles. The soup base and the noodles were a lot lighter than the traditional Taiwanese noodles. I was unsure how to feel about that at first, but I realize that this could be an introduction to Taiwanese food for people who aren't use to the strong flavors that Asian foods sometimes have. This, in combination with the decor and presentation of the place, is a good way of promoting Taiwanese dishes and introduce non-Taiwanese people to Taiwanese dishes. Despite it not being so authentic."
Chop Chop	4	2019-01-07	"I enjoyed a solo dinner here recently. The room is is tiny, but I grabbed a window seat. I had three dishes. The pan-fried dumplings were very good; fresh and expertly fried and lots of flavour, albeit very similar to what you can find elsewhere in Chinatown (see Mother's Dumplings and the Dumpling House for example). The green beans were truly outstanding; perfectly cooked and seasoned, and not too greasy. I could eat a plate of those beans for lunch every single day.

The only (small) misstep was the Taiwanese basil chicken. While hot and fresh, it was a little dry and didn't have much basil flavour.

I would definitely return."
Chop Chop	5	2020-02-14	Best Chinese restaurant in Toronto! The General Tso is the best we've had in Toronto! There isn't a thing on the menu that I wouldn't recommend!
Chop Chop	5	2018-11-08	Came for lunch around 12:30 on a Wednesday. It is a fairly small spot but it wasn't that busy. The service was very prompt and food came out fast so turn around is quick. Loved the ordering sheet. The menu had something for everyone and it all sounded very good. We settled on the shanghai noodles, scallion pancake, deep fried shrimp wontons, spring rolls, pan fried pork and veg dumplings. Bill was around $50 and it was a lot of food for 2 people. Would return to try more items.
Chop Chop	4	2018-09-16	"Family owned restaurant. The outside wall paint of ""chop chop"" stands out from afar and reminded me that blogto did a review of the store awhile back! Very friendly and kind staff! Love how there's patio and inside option depending on weather. Must gets : friend onion pancake, their dumplings. I would also probably recommend getting a plate of greens as a lot of their items are fried. Super cool chill place w/ pretty authentic Asian food!"
Chop Chop	3	2018-11-10	"I give this place 3.5 stars.

This little neighbourhood hole-in-the-wall is one major black west of Chinatown proper. I like the industrial minimalist decor and the open-concept kitchen - which means you can hear the comforting sounds of food being prepared and cooked.

The menu is simple - not the 10-page ones you get at the authentic Chinese restaurants like Asian Legend. It seems they've decided just to focus on the crowd-pleaser items.

We ordered the chilli fish and the beef noodle soup. Both dishes came to the table piping hot. The chilli fish is a medium-sized plate of lightly battered, small fish fillets with a nice kick - I give it 4 stars. The beef noodle soup is a big bowl filled with (mostly) tender pieces beef, thick spaghetti-like noodles, what looked like bak choy and broth that also has a kick - I give it 3.5 stars.

The young wait staff seem eager - which is good. (Perhaps some of the more authentic Chinese restaurants like Kwan - at Yonge-St. Clair -  should have some of their waiters get pointers from Chop Chop.)

I would go back for the chilli fish."
Chop Chop	4	2018-08-29	Chop Chop is a hidden gem Taiwanese restaurant that I have recently discovered! I fell in love with their authentic ginger been and braise beef noodles; both dishes instantly shipped me back to Taiwan the moment I put it in my mouth. That nostalgia flavour you simply couldn't find it anywhere else in this city! Another recommendation is the spicy papaya salad; it is refreshing and herby taste, it is an excellent appetizer!
Chop Chop	4	2018-09-08	"Since I've reviewed this so many times, I figured I'd reiterate my moms first impressions this time. 

Green onion pancake was impressive. 
The baby bok choy wasn't up the par, as it was a bit old. 
The braised beef noodle soup was ok. The soup wasn't strong enough - wasn't Braised long enough. 
Salt and pepper shrimp was ok. It was an old style way of cooking where the shell is still attached. 
Chilli fish was very good for its price and the portion was plentiful. 
Pan fried dumpling's skin was too fragile. It broke upon the touch of the chopstick. 
Basil chicken wasn't special. It reminded us of Go4Tea. 

Overall she gives this place a 3+, so I rounded it to a 4!"
Chop Chop	4	2019-04-17	We ordered and ate way too much at this place! We especially enjoyed General Tao's chicken and the braised short ribs. The dumplings, fried tofu and spring rolls were fine - not spectacular but tasty. The place was cute and our service was excellent. The food came out steaming hot!
Chop Chop	5	2018-07-22	Well, it's been a while since I've reviewed CC and now we are not only regulars, my husband considers it his fave restaurant in the city. Service is always great, their patio rocks, and we never eat anything that isn't delicious (and they change the menu enough you can always try something new). We always get a noodle dish, but we were super impressed by the eggplant and beef today ... mmm and those green beans ... and the fried tofu ... aaaaaa. They really shaped up and found themselves. We love you!! Stop selling out of the pork belly stir fry!!
Chop Chop	4	2019-02-25	"A solid 4 stars.

General Tao Chicken ($14) and the Green Beans ($11) stole the show. Legit, these might be the best green beans I've ever had and the portion is a good size for those concerned about $11 vegetables. 

The Green Onion Pancake ($6) was pretty tasty, and the Basil Fried Chicken was pretty good as well although a little dry. 
Admittedly the fried pork dumplings ($9) were a little too soggy, but when I brought the leftovers home and gave them an extra bit of pan frying for crispier edges was quite good.

Despite being a small place that was busy, I will say I was very impressed with how quickly they get all the food out to you. 
Overall, glad I finally got to try this place out!"
Chop Chop	4	2018-07-28	"What I got: Eggplant with beef ($14), Chili fish ($15), Pan fried pork and chive dumplings ($9), Green Onion pancake ($5), Ginger Beef ($13), Fried Vermicelli ($13)

Pros:
- Great restaurant to check out if you want greasy hangover food without it being the boring burger and fries that you see at the nearby patios. 
- All the items on the menu are under $15 and all dumplings are under $10, if you go with a big group, you can try several items for cheap. 
- My favourite items are the Chili fish and eggplant, they were very flavourful, not too spicy and goes great with rice. Other popular items people got were the sweet and sour pork and fries green beans. 
- They have a great patio however the wait time can be quite long and there is not as much seating inside. We went as a group of 7 and they were nice enough to accommodate even without a reservation 
- Good selection of vegetarian food. 
- They give white rabbit candy at the end when you pay the bill. 
- I also saw that they do delivery and it seems quite popular as foodora bikers were coming in and out frequently. 

Cons:
- Compared to the classic Chinese restaurants in Chinatown, the portions are smaller for almost the same price. However I would say this place is probably cleaner and has a more hip vibe. 
- One star taken off only because the scallion pancake was quite burnt, when we ordered a second, it came out golden with a soft center and crunchy exterior like it should be so it was probably just a one-time issue."
Fudao noodle house	5	2020-01-28	"Totally in love with this place. I always come and order hot pot for my meal and feel really full whenever I finish. 
I would recommend try hot pot with noodles. 
When you become a regularly customers, the manager will give u the soy milk for freee. Lol that's what I love from this store. I love the way the manager treat his customers. They're so nice"
Fudao noodle house	5	2020-01-19	"I simply can not rave enough about this place!! Very good price for the amount and quality of food! This is another place that serves crossing the bridge noodles (a boiling hot broth with toppings on the side that you add into the soup to cook/warm up) with unlimited noodle refills.

They have a wide variety of soup bases ranging from original to pickled cabbage to tomato to spicy ones. My personal favourites are the thai curry (not too spicy) and tomato. They are always adding new flavours such as the recent tom yum. Each soup comes with a bowl of rice noodles and 10 toppings with meat. Sometimes the toppings are on rotation but you usually get: a quail egg, corn, black fungas, fish tofu, shrimp, squid/ham/sausage slices, corn, and tofu skin. It is recommended to put in the meat first into the soup to cook it. Most of the toppings are cooked already so it is just reheated in the soup. 

NOTE: When you receive your plate of toppings, you can ask to switch out a few for other ones instead!  

TIP: If you go before 5pm, they have a 'lunch' special where you get a soup combo with an appetizer and a pop for $10.99!! Previously their combo was a cold appetizer instead of their hot ones.

Side Dishes: For their hot ones, the deep fried cuttlefish balls are my absolute favourite. They come in an amazing sauce as well. The takoyaki is not bad but a little bit too doughy for my taste. I tried the fried tofu but its a bit soggy and too saucy. For their cold ones, I like the garlic cucumber or the duck tongue with seaweed salad. 

Service: Fast and attentive. They would usually remind you to order quickly as well especially if you are borderline near the cut off time for the lunch special. 

Overall, YES. Come here and get your noodle fix!"
Fudao noodle house	5	2019-12-22	"So good and perfect for our last meal in TO! 2 pickled cabbage, 2 original and one chicken ginger with a side of lobster balls. 
Each soup came with 10 add-ins except chicken ginger which had its own chicken pieces and goodies. Very reasonable for so much food - free rice noodle refill ! 
Service was fast and friendly and filled up quickly.
We will be back"
Fudao noodle house	5	2020-02-17	Nothing bad to say about this place! The price was amazing for the amount of food you get. We got the larger portioned meals that come on a burner with extra sides and dipping sauce for $12-13 which was only $1-2 more than the reg portion (price difference for different broths). My boyfriend got the original and I had the tomato broth. Both were delicious! The service was great as well. They offered to refill our broths half way through our meal and always refilled our water without being asked. Definitely coming back! We also received 10% off our bill for checking in on yelp.
Fudao noodle house	5	2019-08-13	"Huge portion soup with free refills! I did not expect so much food for $10.
The thai curry flavour soup was very good. I threw in all the toppings without thinking and it turned out great, nothing went overboard. Will definitely come back to try the other soups."
Fudao noodle house	5	2019-05-04	"Place:
This place is so my favorite! I cannot stress how this is probably a top thing to do in Toronto. 

Service:
The service is pretty good. They are good at providing the necessary things needed for your entrees or what you ordered.

Food/price:
The food is known for their hotpot and ""DIY broths"". It is worth your buck because it is really fun making your own soup. There are some dishes where the noodles are all you can eat. SO WORTH

Audience:
A lot of my friends said that they really love going here when they travel to Toronto. Good for friends or dates! 

Recommend/tips?
I highly recommend this place and the tip would be come when it is not that busy! So not the typical lunch/dinner times."
Fudao noodle house	3	2019-04-13	"Fudao is a standard noodle house that gives really generous portions! 

I was actually expecting it to be more of a dipping noodle situation after seeing the photos but it's actually more of a hot pot since you're supposed to toss in all of the toppings and noodles in your broth immediately before it cools. 

For the price, I think it's a solid spot that will definitely fill you up. The service was just OK. I was surprised that there was a decent amount of seating. If you're visiting, it's not a must but if you're looking for a place to get a substantial amount of food for a good price it's worth trying."
Fudao noodle house	5	2019-10-22	"MUST TRY:
Original noodle soup
Spicy noodle soup
Chicken in chili sauce (side dish)

Recommended:
Takoyaki
Cuttlefish balls
Crispy tofu

Too spicy for me: 
Spicy Pickled Pepper Soup

It's a terrific price point. Excellent cheap eats Obviously, winter is the best time to eat here.


STORY TIME:

[A little boy sucking on a post-dinner restaurant lollipop walked in front of our table. He stared at us. My dinner companion engages...]

DC: Hi, can I help you?
Boy: Can you speak chinese?
DC: No.
Boy: I can speak Chinese.
DC: Ok..
Boy: I was born in China.
DC: Oh...how old are you?
Boy: 8.
DC: What are you carrying?
Boy: I'll show you....

[Boy spends 2 full minutes trying to unzip his bag. Then, he pops out a full tuxedo with a little bowtie.]

Boy: I have a performance tomorrow

Me: Do you play the piano?

Boy: HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT??!!!!!!!!


[His sister walks up. Doublefisting lollipops.]

Sister: hELLOOOOO!!

[Mother grabs the girls hand, gives the boy the death stare, and they leave.]

This did not seem out of place with the casual nature of the restaurant.

Based on a sample of ~5 meals"
Fudao noodle house	3	2019-04-29	"If you dine at Fudao, you should expect a very generous portion of food (due to their unlimited noodle refill) for an extremely reasonable price. However, what stops me from giving this place a higher rating is that I didn't find myself wanting more throughout the meal. 

I tried the Fudao rice noodle and thai curry and Teppan grill squid skewer. I expected the squid to have a nice grilled/smoky taste but when it came to the table, it appeared to have just been boiled(?) and dipped in sauce. The rice noodle dish presentation is pleasant at first, but then you have to dump all the sides immediately into the boiling pot in order to have everything cooked properly. Once this is done, it becomes just like any other noodle dish. The meat was actually surprisingly soft/tender but only 3 pieces will come with the meal.

Regardless, Fudao does seem to be a popular restaurant in Toronto and was packed when I came, so perhaps it's worth a visit. Personally though, if I was back in town, I wouldn't go out of my way for it unless I just wanted to get full for a cheap price."
Fudao noodle house	3	2019-08-18	I think I ordered the wrong broth here. I probably would have enjoyed my meal much more but the broth was overpowering, a lot more pungent than I'm used to. But I powered through it and it ended up being good. So point is, don't get the pickled vegetable with pork broth unless you know what you're getting into! I wish I could come here to try more soups. I love the concept: Piping hot soup still boiling as you dip the veggie and other condiments in. Add a few slices of pork and then the noodles as your last bet. Very presentable and affordable!
Fudao noodle house	5	2019-09-30	Excellent find on our 1st day arrival of Toronto. We walked through China town and found this one, lots of people in there, must be popular. Ordered noodle soup for myself and husband ordered rice dish. We also ordered some side dish, like squid, spicy glass noodle and duck tongue. Soup is delicious! And authentic! Just like i remembered in Yun Nan of China!  When we check out, they don't accept US credit card, US debit card, only cash in Canadian dollar which we don't have! But they accept weechat pay from China! Unbelievable! Guess it's China town.. the service is great!
Fudao noodle house	4	2020-03-07	The food is good here, I love the thai coconut curry broth they have. It is pretty filling considering they have unlimited noodles to order. Its your typical noodle place. Not a fan of how one of the waitors instructs us how to eat and what side to place our bowls etc., ESPECIALLY when at one point we went almost every day to every other day.. like how do you now recognize us? lol anyways other than that its good.
Fudao noodle house	5	2018-10-26	"Came in around 8 PM and it was still quite busy, though the restaurant isn't that big maybe 30-40 seats.

Service is pretty good you can see a waitress going around from time to time checking up on water refills.

This restaurant specializes in crossing bridge rice noodle soup, which you might have seen with the platter of a ingredients beside a stone bowl of hot broth and a bowl of rice noodles on the side. They have a dozen different soup bases for you to choose from whether you like it spicy, sour, or something light.

I ordered the new kimchi soup. It arrived in about 10 minutes, but it was hot and visibly boiling in the bowl. Had a nice flavor; not too salty not too spicy. The soup was quite light in texture, not too much grease, and easy to go down. There's enough soup for two or three refills of noodles if you have a larger appetite.

The ingredients provided include a piece of shrimp, mushrooms, chinese sausage, ground meat, sliced meat, and tofu, which is a pretty nice mix.

According to the menu they have a daily afternoon special between 2 and 5 where you can get any noodle, a cold dish, and a soft drink for only $10.99 which is pretty nice if you're having a late lunch, or an early dinner."
Fudao noodle house	5	2018-11-21	"I am a soup fanatic. I have soup summer winter fall, no matter the season. 

This noodle place fulfills all my criteria: clean, CHEAP, beautiful gorgeous food (I love it when they set down the huge stone pot of soup in front of you), wonderful selection of soup base (I go for the original in the summer, and spicy during winter), they even give you SHRIMP as one of the side dishes, PHEW! LUX! 

Free noodle refill 
Awesome service 
Discount when you pay with cash 
Close to campus 
(Almost) no wait time.

I'm just waiting for them to get $$$ so they can expand to a bigger venue (and possibly franchise it so I can have my soup closer to home..)"
Fudao noodle house	5	2018-12-09	"Decent priced, tasty noodles
Was a little confused on how to order. So we ordered extra meat, which was not necessary because the noodle combos already came with meat."
Fudao noodle house	4	2018-11-11	"What I got: Original Rice Noodle ($8.49) and Pickled Cabbage Soup ($9.99)

Pros:
- Came here on a very rainy day and was able to get seats despite this place being pretty busy on a weeknight. 
- The soups here are supposedly made with no MSG, so you won't have to feel guilty about drinking it.
- Lunch menu is quite worth it, for ~$10 you can get soup noodles, with appetizer and drink. 
- Free refills on the noodles but not on the seafood/meat/veg you put in the soup. 
- Overall a great place for cheap eats with a nice selection of little items you can put into the soup.
- I'd recommend you to put everything in while the soup was still boiling to avoid eating raw seafood.

Cons:
- Take debit and cash only
- The seating arrangement can be a bit tight so you can hear the conversation of the people next to you.
- The Pickled Cabbage soup was on the saltier side, so I would recommend the thai or original one more."
Fudao noodle house	5	2019-07-25	"I love going to Fudao Noodle House to get my fix for Crossing the Bridge noodles. They have a good variety of broths that you can choose from and they range in spice level. My favourite broths are the Thai Curry and the Spicy and Sour. 

For those of you who aren't familiar with Crossing the Bridge noodles, you get the broth in this burning hot stone pot separate from 10 different toppings and the noodles which are unlimited refills, and c'mon, who can say no to that? You put the rolls of meat they give you or you can order extra toppings into your broth like slices of pork, lamb or beef, or even beef/fish balls. Then you put the rest of the toppings in there, the noodles and voila! 

I haven't come by in a while and I came when it was relatively steady but the service was still on point. They've refilled my water and asked if everything was okay ever so often. I also have a shellfish sensitivity so I don't add the shrimp they provide as an extra topping, but when I went on my last visit, they offered to swap it for another ingredient I could eat. It was great customer service and something I don't really see other places that offer Crossing the Bridge noodles doing. 

Overall, really great service and yummy food that is decently priced!"
Fudao noodle house	4	2019-04-20	As an avid fan of Dagu, I must say that Fudao is a veryyy close second (I'll explain why later). Their prices are on average $2 ish cheaper than Dagu and the concept is similar with a few differences in the toppings. I got their picked cabbage soup and man was it good. The soup came out bowling hot and it was hard to not want to drink it in a rush because the flavor was ON POINT. The reason why rated this second to Dagu is because the rice noodles are thinner and I prefer thicker noodles. All in all, 5/5 for value and variety.
Fudao noodle house	4	2019-04-09	"Fixed my noodle craving here and it's unlimited noodles too.

I usually get their Picked Cabbage soup because it's simple and not too heavy. On the side, get the spicy cold noodles. They're AMAZING"
Fudao noodle house	2	2019-02-04	"Cute concept, but the toppings are absolutely horrible! The price is very very low, but I found myself paying less for great food in Chinatown so the low price does not play any factor here.

The toppings to be put into the broth are of the lowest quality. The meat is severely freezer burned and sort of breaks apart in the broth once cooked. Their sausage also tastes like couch medicine in liquid form.. why? Fudao seemed like the perfect place on a freezing Toronto night for me to warm up, but I regretted my decision more and more with each bite that I took."
Magical Taste of China	4	2020-03-31	"BOTTOM LINE: Just as a good as the uptown one but smack in the middle of China Town. Also, is still applies that getting the membership is totally worth it even if you only eat here once a year. 

(This is a pre-COVID19 review)

Please see my review of their original location here: https://www.yelp.ca/biz/xin-jiang-restaurant-markham-2?hrid=haS7u6E9o9XlJcs228UvEg&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)

Their menus are the same but this location is a bit more cramped/cozier than the uptown one, and less upscale in its decor (e.g., your tea is served in the staple steel teapots instead of the nice ones with flowing spouts). 

Their specialty is lamb given it is Northwestern Chinese cuisine, and to that end, I cannot recommend enough their LAMB SKEWERS. I also tried this other cold lamb appetizer (I forgot the name) that was less memorable because the flavours seemed all jumbled up with the other ingredients. Regrettably, in most of their other dishes without lamb, or the dishes that can be considered standard Chinese dishes (e.g., stir fried veggies), I found them quite 'meh', and would recommend you stick with their regional dishes instead."
Magical Taste of China	2	2020-01-27	"I came here with a group of friends and I have to say I wasn't very impressed.

It took us a long time to even get enough menus that we could share. The menus are confusing as there is a large place-mat like sheet you can use, or the menu book with pictures.

Then they tried to sell us a membership. Really? A membership? When I looked at the menu again there are 2 different prices. The cheaper one is the membership price and is of course brighter and more prominent than the higher non-member price. 

We ordered a variety of items and they were all meh. A few items we had to ask for again as they were forgotten. 

The staff run around yelling at each other and its really annoying and disturbing. 

When we finished and tried to pay, the waiter tried to split our bill and half way through asking each of us what we ordered he gave up and gave it to another server, so we had to start over again.

I wouldn't go again unless I went with someone with one of these fancy memberships."
Magical Taste of China	5	2020-01-04	"They have a few locations across the city, and I would say the quality is consistent. 

The 3 must-get items:

1. Garlic shoot rice with lamb (comes in a bamboo pot)
2. Lamb or chicken noodles (stir-fried)
3. Sizzling eggplant with chicken"
Magical Taste of China	1	2019-08-17	"This place is not as good as expected because of the following reasons:

1. Shredded lamb with pancakes were dry and not fresh and portions for the lamb skewers were extremely small compared to some other tables. They should have equal portion sizes for all customers. 
2. The Western Chinese lamb rice is a strange combination of what seemed like sweet potato and the rice was clumped together. It did not taste good. 
3. The membership system is ridiculous as the normal prices have a huge difference for each item listed on the menu. They should provide members to have a discount over the total bill instead. 
4. My friend had food poisoning shortly after leaving the restaurant.

For these reasons, I would be reluctant to come back as there are many places that offer much better quality and portions."
Magical Taste of China	4	2019-07-12	"Yes, I just ate at the same restaurant two nights in a row... but I went to a different location!  

We ordered a cold noodle salad which was sold out at the Dundas location.  Spicy, cool, crunchy, chewy,...  I crave this dish especially in the summer.  

We had a mixed plate of spicy (mouth numbing) beef, tripe, etc... so delicious.  One of my favourite dishes!

The handmade noodles.  I can eat a plate of these noodles with anything on the menu.  It went really well with the sauces from my aforementioned dishes.

The lamb skewer was seasoned nicely with cumin and whatever else they use.   The meat was tender with just a bit of fat.  We didn't mind it at all.

We over ordered with one additional dish.  We had a braised lamb dish served on naan.  I found the bread too heavy and would've preferred it to be served separately.  

I'll admit, I'm still not a fan of the VIP card concept.  You do save on every single dish whether it be $1 or $4.  I do believe the downtown locations are much better than the uptown location at Metro Square.  Now that I know I will come back, we had to purchase one.  It's good at all locations and for 2 years.  

Oh right, the service here was amazing!  The two servers spoke English, were helpful, and were so efficient!  They were friendly too!  Five stars for them!"
Magical Taste of China	5	2020-02-11	I LOVEEEEEE THIS PLACE! This is by far my favourite Chinese restaurant in downtown Toronto. It's hard to find decent Chinese food outside of Markham but this place does it for me. Definitely get one of the soups (they are all very comforting) the fried rice is to die for (and I don't even like fried rice in general), the cold dish smashed cucumbers are just like my mom makes them. I've tried so many dishes here in my past few visits and not a single one of them has been a disappointment. I recommend this place 1 million times over, just make sure that you make reservations or you use yelp to hold your spot in line because there are often long wait times.
Magical Taste of China	5	2020-01-17	Best new Chinese place on Spadina. Western Chinese (I.e., Uyghur/halal), quite different from other Chinese restaurants in the area and very delicious. Lunch specials feature unbelievable value and variety. Clientele mostly Chinese. Service is fast and efficient. You would be crazy not to eat here.
Magical Taste of China	5	2019-12-26	"the owner guys is good n careful for us not to think anything while eating.
the restraints atmosphere also good n comfy"
Magical Taste of China	5	2019-12-13	All good, we have a friend who only eats halah and it's hard to find a restaurant for all of us with different dietary requirements. Glad to find this one!
Magical Taste of China	5	2020-01-17	Totally delicious (and fast!). We live in Chinatown and go out a lot and this is our new favourite spot.
Magical Taste of China	1	2019-12-15	Very bad service the servers are so loud and rude .. the food tastes bad and super oily, the chicken is not white meat while they told me it was , the rice had rocks in it that almost broke my tooth and so not clean the whole experience was so bad I wouldn't recommend anyone to go there and on top of that I went back home with food poison and had diarreah .. the worst place ever please watch out
Homemade Ramen	5	2020-03-20	"I stumbled upon this restaurant during my first visit to Toronto. I always make an effort to go there every time I visit because it's that good!

First off, don't be alarmed by the man in the back who looks like he's abusing the noodles. Everything comes hand-pulled and fresh! I love the thick cut noodles with chicken. Prices are great and portions are huge. What else can you ask for?!"
Homemade Ramen	5	2020-02-16	"Amazing prices, huge portions and everything was delicious. I come here a couple times a week and have always had a great experience.

I love their cold side dishes like chily beef tendon, shredded potato salad and tofu salad, it's a great paring with the noodle soups"
Homemade Ramen	5	2020-01-27	"Great beef noodle soup place! The place doesn't look like much, to be honest, but their food is quite delicious.

As with many Asian restaurants, they're very hands-off with their service. Only there to take your order, give you food, and refill water. Personally I prefer service like this, because they aren't asking you questions about food that you don't know how to answer, or will inevitably just default to ""good"" because you can't think of anything else and are trying to be Canadian-polite. 

Their food is all quite reasonably priced and with many noodle options--both with and without soups. Their noodles are hand-pulled and are wonderfully elastic and chewy! Their broth is also pretty nice, not overly salty, but a great base for chili oil. That being said, it's not particularly unique compared to a lot of beef noodle soup places in the GTA, but it's still a wonderful addition.

Come by if you want a nice comforting warm bowl of food!"
Homemade Ramen	4	2020-01-26	"Dined in here for early lunch on Sunday with a party of 5.  There were plenty of seats available.  It looks like the place was getting busier with people coming in. 

Tried the beef skewer (2skewers for $3.49) and it was nicely seasoned.  It was very chewy with fat in it.  The dumpling (4pcs for $2.99) was crispy and delicious. 

The hand pulled ramen with braised soup ($9.49) was pretty good.  I would have enjoyed it more if it was spicy.  I added the chilli sauce they provided on the side and it made a big difference-giving the broth more flavour.  They were pretty generous on the amount of braised beef given.  I opted for the wide big noodle and it reminded me lasagna noodles lol.  It was nice of them to provide me with scissors to cut my noodles or else it would have been hard to eat 

I tried my brother's hot spicy noodles sichuan style ($9.99) and I enjoyed it. This was a dry noodle mixed with bean sprouts, green onions, cucumber and ground pork.  He opted for regular noodles.  I really enjoyed the spice in it.  

Overall, the size of their noodle dishes were huge.  Struggled to finish my noodles even though it was my first meal of the day."
Homemade Ramen	5	2020-01-15	"One thing I noticed in Toronto is that there are many homemade noodle shop, and there is one on Spadina Avenue that I enjoyed a lot. Homemade Ramen (中國蘭州牛肉拉面) sells authentic lan zhou ramen (蘭州拉面). Once you enter the shop, you can see a chef at the back pulling noodles non-stop. They make the noodles fresh to order, and they have 6 different noodles to choose from. Each has a different thickness and width. 

We ordered two items to share, and of course, we have to order a bowl of Hand-Pulled Noodle with Beef, as well as Shredded Pig's Ear with Chili.

For the Hand-Pulled Noodle with Beef, the default noodles are regular, which are 2.5mm wide. However, I decided to change to leek leaves, which are 5mm flat noodles. Once our order was in, the chef started to pull noodles, though I wasn't sure if he is making our orders. Within 10 minutes, our noodles arrived. The broth is clear and light, with few beef slices and pickled radish. The portion is huge, so it is perfect to share. The noodles are perfectly cooked, nice and chewy. I love the broth so much, and I am surprised by the addition of pickled radish in the soup - the combination goes super well together. 

The Shredded Pig's Ear with Chili came as well. It looks spicy, but it is not. It is on a sweeter side, with the addition of bell peppers. I prefer having just the shredded pig's ear with minced garlic and chili oil on its own. The bell peppers are not necessary here. 

*** Overall Impression ***

Homemade Ramen is another gem on Spadina Avenue. It has good service, clean ambiance, and most importantly, inexpensive noodles. You can get a bowl of noodles for less than $10 here, and I can guarantee that you will leave with a full stomach!  Although I didn't try much here, I will definitely revisit and try other noodle bowls! My recommended item here is the Hand-Pulled Noodle with Beef, and I think the leek leaves' width and thickness are perfect. 

Taste : 4.5/5 * Service: 4/5 * Ambiance: 4.5/5 * Quality-Price: 5/5"
Homemade Ramen	4	2019-11-09	"Having recently gone to GB and not feeling fulfilled, I can safely say Homemade satisfied my hand-pulled noodle soup craving. 

Located in the heart of Chinatown, Homemade is now one of my favourite restaurants as (1) I'm a huge soup noodle fan, and (2) they have a larger selection of soup noodles vs. their competitors. I found the noodles themselves to be far superior than the other places as the chefs here understand that it is not just about the novelty of pulling noodles but also how to cook them - to just the right texture (expect a little chewiness similar to al dente). The other places make a big show from the making of the noodles but then end up overcooking them so that become too starchy or soft, Homemade gets it just right.

We also ordered the lamb skewers which were delicious and a must-try. Servings were also generous. Homemade ramen should be at the top of the list when considering which restaurants to eat at in Chinatown."
Homemade Ramen	4	2019-03-21	"Was absolutely starving after a morning at the museum and then decided to go to Homemade Ramen. I asked for a table of one for lunch and was immediately seated. They have a menu and a notepad you can write on for what you want (which is kinda interesting). Then give the notepad to the waiter/waitresses and wait for your food!

Sliced noodle stir-fry with lamb ($11.99) - I loved the sliced noodles; unfortunately for me, it wasn't uber uber thick. However I did love the noodle flavor and there was a lot of stuff on the plate for the price that I paid. They have a good amount of meat in there and I was absolutely enthralled of that fact. There were some vegetables in there that I didn't really like, but you know, to each their own haha. I loved having it stir fried and I loved the flavor that came out of it. It's good and aplenty.

Also went for the scallion pancake which I enjoyed; it was cut in 5 pieces. It's a bit of a crisp but not too much scallion flavor really in there, but I do love the flour flavor in there.

Food comes out at a good pace; service is decent - flag em down haha. I do wish I knew what the option for thick noodles are, but not noodle soup hahahahaha."
Homemade Ramen	4	2019-03-10	"I was craving some warm noodles when I stumble across this restaurant. Upon looking at the menu, I realize there were many options to choose from! I got the slice noodle with braised beef and the portion size was really big. 

I found the noodles and soup to be a bit on the bland side but it was still delicious. 

I also got their lamb kebob and their green onion pancake and it was warm and really good as well!

The service here was quick and servers were all very nice. It's definitely a place I would come back to again."
Homemade Ramen	4	2019-07-29	This place is awesome. I love their pork belly. It was nice to add cucumber to the dish, so refreshing. I also got their noodles dish as well. I ordered big wide noodles and regretted later. I didn't expect the noodles to be that wide. I was struggling the whole time eating the noodles but the broth was amazing. I would highly recommended visiting this place if you ever in Chinatown.
Homemade Ramen	3	2019-01-06	"Fresh ramen noodles are not the healthiest food you can eat, but do taste so good.  I picked a dish with braised beef.  The noodles were extremely enjoyable. The braised beef was not tender.  Next time I will pick another meat with extra noodles!

Service was prompt & efficient. Decor is very basic."
Homemade Ramen	5	2019-06-10	"One of our go-to spots! 

For price, flavour and quantity of food - you can't go wrong. 

My favourite things in this place are the skewers. Just drooling while writing this haha. The lamb, beef and chicken options are heavennn! So much flavour. 

Always need veggies with my meals, so we order Chinese broccoli with garlic. I don't know what they do to the meal. Super simple but it's so crunchy and tasty.

Lastly, hand pulled noodles are a must. I usually go for the braised beef but this time around we got the sliced beef. I prefer braised! You get a good mix of fat to meat ratio.

Highly recommend this place. Just don't be high maintenance!"
Homemade Ramen	4	2019-04-21	Came here for dinner and I never knew this place existed in Chinatown.  I definitely enjoyed their homage ramen.  The noodles are soft and chewy and the portions are big too.  Prices are reasonable as well.
Homemade Ramen	4	2020-01-05	This ramen place is always reliable when you're in the area and want a warm bowl of noodles. Service is quick, prices are reasonable, and there's a bit more protein in it than your usual ramen places. The noodles are fresh but sometimes more chewy than other times. There is a lot of noodle so it is filling for sure.
Homemade Ramen	5	2020-03-05	Usually spend no more than $30 for dinner for two here. Very affordable and delicious. All noodles are made fresh in-house. Items to get on menu are: saliva chicken, stir fried noodles, dry chicken noodle with a chili, and some lamb skewers. It's been renovated not too long ago, place is bright and clean. Service is consistently good for a Chinese restaurant.
Homemade Ramen	4	2018-10-18	"Tip: Don't forget to designate what size of noodles you want; I forgot as the menu doesn't show the options but the restaurant wall does.

Solo traveler here. Spending a few days in Toronto and me not being used to the cold (Cali girl here), I was really craving for some hot soup. Saw some good reviews and liked the hand-pulled noodle aspect to the restaurant, so wanted to check this place out.

The waitresses were very friendly. They give you receipt paper where you write down your order and they take it to the kitchen. I ordered the braised beef noodle soup as well as the beef sesame pancake. Pretty cool that near the cash register you can see someone hand pulling the noodles. 

Food came out at a reasonable time. The beef was kinda cold and a little dry, wasn't living for it. The noodles were alright; I forgot to indicate what size noodles I wanted as the sizes are only mentioned on the wall, not in the actual menu. Soup was a bit salty, added some chili oil and it mellowed it down a bit. As for the beef sesame pancake, I should've looked more closely to the Yelp pics because it was smaller than I expected it to be lol. 4 small pieces for 6 bucks.....more than a buck a piece lol. Though pre-judgment aside, the pieces were actually pretty tasty lol I'd actually eat it as a snack.

Would I want to come back here again? Hmm, maybe to try out the other soups in the menu and ask for larger noodles."
Homemade Ramen	3	2018-10-02	"Pros: quick service, nice staff, great (fresh) ramen noodles 
Cons: dirty table, staff overworked, hard to get a table after lunch still, difficulty finding the best vegetarian/chicken options, some waiters can't communicate in English that well though are super nice and try hard 

Summary: I ordered chicken despite wanting vegetarian but am new to eating more veggie options so I tried to just get the Chicken stir fry. It was all chicken, too much salt and barely any veggies. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again but I'd be open to getting a ramen dish. My mom got beef so I couldn't really try it, I only tried the noodles. She loved her beef ramen so maybe that helps someone out there"
Homemade Ramen	5	2019-02-19	Best chinese ramen in chinatown. I personally like knife shaved noodles and these are of the best I have had around chinatown. They are of a good size and thickness and perfectly chewy. They are very generous with the meat and it was melt in your mouth quality beef brisket.
Homemade Ramen	3	2018-09-11	"Noodles are what they do best, and that's what brought me back to this restaurant for the second time. It's a budget friendly spot to grab a bite in Chinatown. I really like the texture of the noodles here,  just a bit of chew, but still soft and lots of fun to eat. Everything else that goes with the noodles however doesn't quite stand out. Don't get me wrong, it's still delicious; an unhealthier version of what my mom would make. Maybe I've been spoiled by my moms cooking :p

The stir fried noodles are drowning in oil, and lots of msg used to add flavor to those cold dishes. It's hard to not like it, but so much regrets after. The portions are big but somehow I managed to clean the plate. As I wipe at my oil covered mouth from slurping the stir fried noodle, slowly realizing what I've done, my first instinct is that I should go on a juice cleanse tomorrow. However, as soon as I stepped out of the shop, I'm back to my normal self, thought of juice cleanse replaced by ""what should I have for dinner?"""
Homemade Ramen	2	2019-09-28	This was just okay for me. There are so many hand pulled noodle places in Toronto now that I'm not sure this really stands out. They have generous noodle portions but not so many veggies. Meat was all right. I think my big mistake was getting the chicken wings which turned out being tasteless and with breading similar but (not as flavorful) as KFC. Oh well. On to the next place.
Homemade Ramen	3	2019-03-15	I guess I'm becoming more health-conscious, but after loading up on carbohydrates in the form of noodles, I didn't feel great afterwards. The noodles themselves are a step above your ordinary noodles, I have to admit. They do a good job in the noddles department, but I couldn't shake off the feeling that I ate something that wasn't beneficial for my health or my body. That place was packed on a Friday evening, so I'm guessing it's pretty popular and has a loyal clientele. Despite good service, I probably won't be coming back as my diet and food preferences are slowly shifting toward healthy & nutritious food that good for my body. Everyone has to make their own choice. After all, you are what you eat. Food is medicine if you eat the right food.
Noodle King	5	2019-07-27	"LUNCH

If I checked in on yelp every time I have came here for lunch, It would break the internet. The yelp data server would probably be filled with only my check ins lol. Yes, it is that much!

I always order the same thing when I come. Half BBQ pork (cha-siu) and half BBQ Chicken on rice. 

Its gotten to the point where the owner and I just speak telepathically to each other. As soon as he sees me walking towards him, the lady is already preparing my meal lol. 

Their sauce is crack man, I dunno what they put in it, but damn sun, Its mad delicious! Make sure you get some when ordering any bbq rice dish. 

I am a big fan of this place as you can tell. Even Jon Snow would bend the knee if he ate here!

Long live the Noodle King! Ruler of the seven food courts, and true Heir to the Iron wok! ;)"
Noodle King	4	2020-05-24	"Noodle King is a little bit hard to find for first-timers. However, it's a very well known shop in PATH that every office worker in the Downtown area should know. You get a bowl filled with customizeable noodles/meat that is instantly made within just 1-2 minutes. My favourite is the BBQ Chicken Noodle Soup. The chicken is tender and flavourful. The soup is so appetizing that you'd want to finish the whole bowl - including the soup. You are free to choose the type of noodle/meat you like which I think it's a plus. I personally love the chewiness of the wonton noodles. There's also chili sauce available on the side. Overall food portion is sufficient - just enough that you will still be able to work after. The best part is pricing. This whole bowl of goodness costs less than $10 with tax included. It's probably one of the best deals in PATH food court. 

The line can be long during lunch hours so you should avoid 12-1 pm."
Noodle King	4	2019-08-06	"I was going through one of my carb-craving phases last week and came back to Noodle King for a decent bowl of egg noodles!

The line was fairly short as I managed to avoid the lunch rush at 1:30PM as it was a long weekend on a Friday. 

The service is always efficient and you don't have to wait long to get your hot delicious bowl. Most of their toppings are on display including the veggies, proteins (fish balls, beef balls, chicken leg) etc. The noodles are pre-cooked then heated up quickly in a vat of hot water then transferred to a bowl of steaming soup.

This time around I got fish balls with egg noodles. There was an abundance of fish balls with chewy egg noodles. The soup was subtly flavored which I always douse in hot sauce. Perfect lunch meal that doesn't leave you too full but enough to satisfy cravings.
Total came to about $7!"
Noodle King	4	2019-05-21	"Yes, yes, yes and so much yes. You want noodle soup, you go here. The End. 

I eat here an embarrassing amount.  I've had the wonton shrimp noodle soup, the pork noodle soup, and the bbq chicken noodle soup and they're all delish.  And not overpriced.  The food court this place is in is a little dingy (compared to other food courts nearby) but the food is worth it. At lunch during the week, this place has a huge lineup - but it goes very fast.  My personal favourite is the bbq chicken which is somehow so much more tender than the regular rotisserie style chicken. 

If you want noodle soup and you don't go here, you are totally missing out."
Noodle King	5	2018-07-26	"Well, damn. This place is just too good to be stuck in a dimly lit food court with a dimly lit sign in the middle of almost nowhere.

Of course, I've had it bookmarked for a pretty long time after seeing the outstanding reviews, but it took stumbling upon it by accident while getting lost in the PATH to actually try it out. Definitely one of the best hidden gems I've ever been to! The noodles are absolutely delicious, and the broth was so savoury I literally gulped it down. The shrimp wontons? Huge! I was really surprised to see the enormous pieces of shrimp packed in them. The vegetables were super fresh too - no wilted leaves here! And nothing tasted like the artificial or over-seasoned MSG filled stuff you might expect at a food court (or elsewhere). Can this place open up other locations already??? I think it can give even some of the popular restaurants uptown a run for their money. :P

Can I also just say again, bless you Yelp, you're doing great work :D"
Noodle King	4	2019-02-24	"This is my new and fave go-to lunch spot on work days not only because it's a convenient 30 second walk from my office, but because it's cheap and delicious! 

I've tried a number of their menu options and noodle selections, but my favourite has to be the pork wonton noodle soup with egg noodles. The pork wontons are huge and juicy, packed with lots of flavour. The wonton wrapper is a bit thicker than normal wrappers, but I think this helps keep the flavour packed in. You get 5 of these in the dish and it also comes with 2 stalks of bok choy and 1 stalk of broccoli along with your choice of noodles and broth. Not a fan of the rice noodles (thin or thick) as they do not retain any of the flavour from the broth and are quite bland to eat on its own. But the egg noodles are great as they do hold in the rich and flavourful and not too salty broth. The portion of this dish is huge as well as it leaves me struggling to finish the whole bowl! Such a steal for only $7.41 after tax I might add. 

Don't be discouraged by the long lines or shady food court location - this place is really a hidden gem and the lines move fast. They definitely know what they're doing and know how to win you over!"
Noodle King	5	2019-10-24	"Really delicious tasting broth and large portion of noodles and pork dumplings. Good value. 
Will definitely return to try the other flavours."
Noodle King	4	2018-10-20	"Visited a Friday at 11h30am.. Within the next 15 minutes, the line up became huge. Ordered the spicy beef soup for 9.99, as well as fried pork dumplings (3 for 2.59)... Pop is a buck a can
 Soup was beefy, meat was tender and tasty, broth was nice, noodles were a bit bland (Shangai style). Dumplings were tasty and worth it."
Noodle King	4	2017-12-10	"The wonton is much much better compared to any other ones served in foodcourt. The best part is you can add fish balls for additional cost. If you don't like bak choy you can get broccoli instead.

If you like a kick to the flavour of the noodle, you can ask them to give you a little brisket sauce added to the broth. One of the best wonton noodles for foodcourt. 

Will be back even when the walk is a little far from my office."
Noodle King	3	2018-02-21	"I love eating here on my comfort food/cheat days.

They have classic Hong Kong style soup noodles and bbq rice dish.  The noodles are made to order.  They have rice noodles, thick noodles, egg noodles to choose from.  Toppings include beef balls, fish balls, bbq pork, shrimp wonton, prom wonton, chicken, lemongrass chicken, beef stew, and others.  Better yet you can pick and choose.  You can get additional toppings like half size wonton, tofu, or beef sauce to add-on.  You can also pick just broccoli or bak choy.

You can pick rice dish too.

There is vegetarian options.

Their soy bean drink is small but tasty.

Staff is nice and friendly.

Line is long but service is fast."
Noodle King	5	2017-09-14	"I don't think I've ever given a 5 for a food court restaurant..
I can see why it's popular, plus it's funny there are 2 asian restaurants side by side; one clearly outdoing the other...
The service was really friendly, I went at off peak (probably best when you see the lines online, I imagine it moves fairly quickly..).
Good lunch for under 10 bucks, rare."
Noodle King	5	2019-10-20	Go every Friday for lunch.  Love their shrimp dumpling noodle soup.  Very busy place but they move a lot customers quickly.
Noodle King	5	2019-04-08	Noodle King is an unassuming noodle stand in an underground food court. The noodles, broth, meat, and vegetables all were perfect! I ordered the BBQ pork bowl.
Noodle King	3	2018-08-30	"Living in Markham & Scarborough before and now close to Chinatown, I had tasted the best and cheap noodle soup. So trying Noodle King for the first time, I wasn't really impressed.

Yes, their Shrimp Wontons are massively huge and I counted 5 pcs in my soup. So I guess that makes a difference considering they give you crappy servings when you eat in food court places.

But I still paid $8.19 for my soup which to me is still not that cheap. Still the soup didn't blow my mind or something."
Noodle King	5	2018-05-04	"This place has the best Asian comfort food I've found in dt yet. Their shrimp wanton noodles are great and I've tried their BBQ chicken too, also delicious. The prices are more uptown prices than downtown, so it's cheaper than most food courts nearby. I try to come here every week or so.

Avoid peak times but if you see a long line, it moves fast. It's also open during the weekend which is great."
Noodle King	5	2019-07-14	Best, cheap and delicious eat in financial district as it gets! When I used to get long lunch breaks, I'd meet every friend to eat here. You don't come for the environment but for the speedy, delicious wonton noodles and soy milk beverage. Wish they had this uptown as well as it would be a great snack on weekends as well. 5/5 recommend and they have also have rice as well which are good!
Noodle King	5	2017-12-07	"So this is a hidden gem buried under the Sheraton hotel. I usually go here before catching a show at the Four Seasons. 

It's the smallest crappiest food court that one could imagine. I think there are 5 stalls. A subway, hero burger, a random Greek place and another place I can't remember. Then there's this place. 

Family run joint service up awesome bowls of noodle soup and other dishes. 

I only have ordered the vegetarian noodle soup (with egg noodles - my fave). Firstly, it's a huge portion with lots of veggies. Secondly it is loaded with veggies and fresh tofu. Thirdly it's cheap. $6 for a humongous portion. Fourthly it's very flavourful. Fifthly, the owners are really nice. Sixthly, there's no wait. Seventhly the broth is absolutely delicious. Eighthly, you should check out this hidden gem. 

I always love finding hole in the ground (literally) pleases that serve up amazing food at cheap prices to only those that know about it. 

Go eat here."
Noodle King	4	2018-08-31	"I have been here twice this week and it's all about knowing what's good.

Pork wonton soup with rice noodle - kinda meh. Broth was delicious but there wasn't enough. Was left with a bunch of soggy rice noodles without much flavour. 5/10

Spicy beef noodle soup - awesome! Fatty beef with egg noodles swimming in spicy deliciousness. Get the spicy sauce. 10/10

And it's all pretty cheap(+0.5)

So average it out and it's a pretty good (8/10) cheap lunch place."
Noodle King	5	2018-04-26	"The place is at the Sheraton's food court in the concourse level. So glad I read the previous reviews and gave it a try... you will not be disappointed. 
The wontons are so good. I tried the shrimp and ordered one piece of the pork wonton to try. They both were amazing!  I'm so cautious to order dumplings because they look/taste like mystery meat but not here. These dumplings are so tasty and good quality filling."
Noodle King	4	2018-11-12	Great food for the price. Filling, tasty and fresh, definitely recommend for a quick meal!
Bamboo Kitchen	5	2019-12-04	Its was a great place to explore such delicious Chinese food. Enjoy it and the owner was super friendly.. and staff are great. lot of  food selections..all dish we ordered come out so good.. love this place.. ..  definitely will  come back again...
Bamboo Kitchen	2	2014-01-12	"Good take-out place with well-priced specials each day for the price of $4.99 before tax.  Went here on a whim and ordered the Sunday specials of eggplant tofu on rice and BBQ chicken leg.  You get what you pay for.  Greasy more than flavourful.  It is delicious in comforting way.  The hot and sour soup was plenty hot but not sour enough.  Service was brisk and abrupt.  Seems to be frequented by students and there's a bit of a language barrier.

Not particularly motivated to try it again in the future no matter what the price point could be."
Bamboo Kitchen	5	2018-03-26	Much better quality than other Chinese food restaurants in the East end outside of East Chinatown. Chili chicken is nice
Ha Gow Dim Sum House	5	2020-03-21	I've been doing some causal quick drop in meals here for a bit and just wanted to pass a review about the epic pick up meal I had today. My GF and I stopped in mid day and ordered a couple meals worth of food to go. I Mist say their dumplings are amongst the best I've had. We mostly ordered typical dim sum fair but I also had the salt fried shrimp which as usual was epic. Shrimp fried rice outstanding. I should add the curry squid was out of control. This is a lovely family run business and I hope they get through the next weeks as they're an absolute gem.
Ha Gow Dim Sum House	2	2019-09-24	"We were in the neighborhood and couldn't decide what to eat so we did what others would do in our situation which was to bust out our phones and go on Yelp for suggestions! Well Yelp led us to this place based on its high ratings but I'm sad to say that Yelp has failed me again.  This restaurant's dimsum quality was not good. The curry cuttlefish was very watery and bland, their chicken feet had a weird taste, their sui mai was okay but again kind of bland, their spare ribs was full of fat and the list goes on and on with negative things to say about their other dishes. None was good!

Service was okay but their debit machine was down and I didn't have cash on me and when I asked if they take e- transfers, they said no. So I had to drive out to a bank to get cash which was a bit of a pain but of well.

Definitely will not comes back to this one."
Ha Gow Dim Sum House	4	2018-11-06	"Unfortunately, this area does not have any other nearby places for dim sum. So there are no competitive prices for morning dim sum, and the food itself is not the best, when compared to restaurants in Markham, etc. However, considering this is the only place available, I think it's a good option when you're craving dim sum and do not want to commute or drive for an hour.

We tried the seafood dumplings (very doughy), fish congee (really nice), fried shrimp dumplings (tasty, essentially fried har gow), and spinach dumplings (very doughy). I do not eat meat and so didn't try the siu mai, tripe and pepper short rib, but heard that the latter two were quite tough and chewy. 

The staff was very friendly and accommodating. If we're in the area again and hungry for dim sum, I would come back, but it would not be my first choice. Most dishes were $4-5, and our bill came to $40 total."
Ha Gow Dim Sum House	5	2020-03-20	Went inside randomly cause I wanted some chinese food but didnt get the kind i was expecting. Needless to say this restaurant has completely opened my eyes to how delicious authentic chinese food is. You literally see these people make everything fresh infront of you too, its not some premade stuff they pull out of a container its legit ingredients. The people were super friendly and accomodating too, even though i walked in with no cash the guy pointed me out to a bunch of places with ATMs and apologized for it, was really chill even though I wasnt sure of what i wanted and suggested the safest choices and what he thought i would like. Stellar service, most places cant get you out of the door fast enough and i cant go back to those fake chinese food places, they dont compare to this hidden gem. If you're in Toronto and you want good food get it from here people!
Ha Gow Dim Sum House	5	2019-02-17	"Honestly, a pretty solid place. The prices are great and it's a little weird that they're not open for lunch/brunch, but if you're craving dim sum for dinner then this is your spot. The dim sum is fresh and seems to be made with quality ingredients. Tastes similar enough to some of the other places in the city that I would come here for the savings. Some odd items were not as good: shui mai, and fried green onion pancake was SUPER doughy and not flakey. But other items were great: har gow, spinach shrimp dumplings, fried turnip cake, fried rice, etc. I generally judge a dim sum place by its har gow so this is 5 stars.

Would come back."
Ha Gow Dim Sum House	3	2019-08-13	We have been here for takeout a few times here. Remember its CASH ONLY so pack those 20 bills. I really liked their dim sum sampler, with classic dumplings like shrimp and seafood. I would recommend the dim sum sampler over their dishes.
Ha Gow Dim Sum House	5	2019-10-27	I was craving dim sum and found this place near me via a google search. The rave reviews had me on my way. I was not disappointed! Fabulous food, friendly and quick service, clean but simple ambiance.  I ordered the dim sum sampler for only $15. It was so filling, hot, delicious and everything I could have asked for. I'll be back and I mean soon and I'm bringing family and friends.
Ha Gow Dim Sum House	5	2018-04-17	"Came here for lunch. And the lady working here was so happy that someone speaking Cantonese with her. So cute
It's very local dim sum place just similar HK style 
I used to eat every weekend for dim sum when I was living in HK. So I miss it so much!!
Their material and ingredients are very fresh and great deal for the price :) deff going again soonnnnnn!!!
Love it here!"
Ha Gow Dim Sum House	4	2018-01-03	"This place has some tasty treats! I enjoyed a curry and onion dish with the most tender baby squid. So delicious! There were shrimp balls, steamed shrimp dumplings, beef balls with chive and plain. So good, but somehow we didn't order classic dim sum! Go figure. 

The atmosphere was hole in the wallish (typically a good thing) and in this case it was a good thing indeed. Prices were fair and the fillings of the dishes were generous. 

Seating was a bit uncomfortable, but the warm tea was nice. Friendly server as well. Rad sign out front too. I forgot to take a photo of it, but here are the photos I did grab!"
Ha Gow Dim Sum House	3	2018-08-27	"I think I set my expectations too high for this place. Being chinese I keep hearing how good the dim sum was in toronto. I studied Yelp for a good while trying to find a dim sum place with good reviews. I looked at all different menus from different places and decided on this place. It was cash only so I had money exchanged after we crossed into Canada. We drove 2 hours (there was traffic) to get there. Had to pay for parking. It was a small hole in the wall place with literally 8 small tables total. I've been in many hole in the walls so no judging there...especially if the taste of the food was out of this world good! Not in this case...I must say that I've had better dim sum at a mediocre place in VA. MD by far has the best dim sum so if you're in the Rockville area, try out the dim sum there, both Cantonese and Taiwanese style! 
Anyways my family liked it but their not Chinese (my mixed family of Blasians) so to them, dim sum is dim sum. They did agree that we have better dim sum back home in VA/MD. 
The selection wasn't as great either but I did see the cook in the back making the dumplings fresh. My youngest son love dumplings and he commented that it wasn't as good as my mom's lol. Duh..of course grandma makes the best dumplings. 
The server was very nice but we wont be back. Dont believe the hype! Or at least not from here."
Ha Gow Dim Sum House	4	2019-01-04	Totally tasty and dependable dim sum outside of Chinatown. I usually get their combo and it's more than enough food with great variety - though it doesn't include any steamed buns, sadly. It's not the prettiest place on the danforth but it's a great take out option when you're having that shu mei craving.
Ha Gow Dim Sum House	3	2019-09-22	Spinich garlic shrimp was great. Beef shu mai was a little salty. Sour and sweet pork was too dry and hard to chew, so they replaced it with sour and sweet chicken.  It is cash only!
Ha Gow Dim Sum House	1	2019-03-03	"Went today with my boyfriend to try the dim sum over the weekend and was disappointed. Got there at 1:30 PM and ordered about four or five different dim sum's and was told to wait while it was being made. 

The order was for take out. Waited for an hour and a bit and still no end in sight of when I would get my order. I must've seen five Uber eats pick up their orders way after me and there were two or three people behind the line that got seated for dine in, and got served their food before me getting my order. 

After waiting patiently for an hour for my take out order to be completed I went up to the cashier and told them to cancel our order since it wasn't even made at that point. All they said was that they were really backed up. I spoke to both workers and said this isn't right that you guys didn't tell us we have to wait A whole hour for take out. We have been standing at the restaurant at the lineup for a whole hour and still our order was not made at that point in time. Poor Organization."
Ha Gow Dim Sum House	1	2018-01-14	"Worst Chinese food ever. It's places like this that give Chinese food a bad name. Threw out 75% of our order. 

Ordered what I thought would be staple Cantonese dishes that any decent place would find hard to screw up. Well guess what, Ha Gow managed to do just that. The seafood fried noodles were capital B bland - would it have hurt them to put even one drop of soy sauce? They also used cheap shrimp and squid that had no flavour. We also ordered the fried shrimp with spicy salt. This is honestly the most basic Cantonese dish (equivalent to fries for a Canadian restaurant). Well what came were those cheap shrimps they used for the noodles but smothered in a thick batter (they looked like balls of grease). Each bite oozed with grease and didn't taste like shrimp at all.

The other dishes ordered were equally bad. Seafood dumpling (all it tasted of was MSG), steamed squid in ginger and onion (think rubber bands laced with MSG), and shrimp rolls (no flavour). The spinach & shrimp dumpling was the only thing decent item. 

Avoid, avoid, avoid."
Ha Gow Dim Sum House	5	2019-01-31	The service was friendly, the place was definitely clean, and the food was good and affordable. I wasn't there long and didn't try many dishes, so I can't say too much, but I can at least say that I would return if I were in the area again.
Ha Gow Dim Sum House	5	2015-02-23	"The number one dim sum and mom-and-pop shop in Toronto - hands down. The dim sum comes out steamy hot and the dishes are deliciously flavourful! 

We ordered the ha how, siu mai, garlic squid, spinach dumpling, and a bunch of other dishes too. For 2 people, I suggest ordering at least  6 or 7 dishes (each are around $3-4). Our total came to $35 with tax and tip. This restaurant is a definitely among my top 10 places to eat in Toronto. I am in a dim sum nirvana just reminiscing about our dinner here. Only locals know about this place so it's almost never packed.

Pro tip: You need to order at the counter. So pick up an order slip, choose wisely on your fav dishes, and hand it back to the person behind the counter. 

Prop tip 2: You'll need to ""self-serve"". So grab your plates, chopsticks, tea, etc. They only bring you the food. The food makes up for this so I don't care.

Prop tip 3: There's tables that seat up to 4, so don't come with a crowd of 10 or more. 

Transit directions: Take the TTC to Donlands Station, walk towards Danforth (turn right when you exit the station entrance) and then when you're on Danforth, look straight across. It's a bit hidden, but well worth the find.

When we were here, there was a white dude working with the Chinese mom, dad, and uncle. We had speculated that he was adopted but didn't ask. Anyways, they were all super nice. 

Pro tip 4: They deliver locally and have lunch specials.

I wish I lived nearby because I'd be here at least once a week. It's my dim sum secret place, more of an ""super elite spot"" in my books. In comparison, the food here is far superior than compared to any dim sum restaurant near Dundas and Spadina. I think it's their family recipes that are used and the fact that the owners really care about the art of dim sum making. A must eat!"
Ha Gow Dim Sum House	5	2015-03-13	"I love dim sum. This is one of my favourite dim sum place as its in a convenient location (just a few steps from Donlands station) and pricing is reasonable. A plate of dim sum starts from $2.90. Depending what you order. 
Its fresh, fast and affordable pricing with good portions.
They also have dishes served apart from dim sum like long green bean str fry with black beans served with rice which is my favourite. 
They have a self serve style which you order and pay at the counter and they will bring you the food. Chinese tea and water is situated at a corner for self replenishment. Its a quick, fuss-free self serve style of dim sum. Bonus is, they do delivery too."
Ha Gow Dim Sum House	4	2018-03-22	Dim Sum is definitely 4.5, excellent taste and I highly recommend the Steamed Bean Curd Skin Roll/Meat with Japanese mushroom and the steamed spare ribs. The reason why I have not rated it a 5 Star is because of the ambiance. It's a little small and a cash only establishment. Otherwise, you can't go wrong with the food.
Ha Gow Dim Sum House	3	2017-09-30	"Dim sum wasn't bad. I actually preferred this over the downtown China Town dim sum, but markham was better. But if don't feel like a drive thru traffic, not a bad second choice.

Ignore the decor or I think if they rearranged some stuff it would look good. 

Service was attentive but only one server who did everything so be patient. Other reviewers did mention they were out of certain items...which if they were, they should inform us and not have it on the board.

Will go back..."
Ha Gow Dim Sum House	4	2018-11-26	Got to this place recently. The shrimp dumplings were delicious. At least to my tastes. It has been a long time since I last got dim sum so I can't really compare to other places but I certainly enjoyed my meal and would like to come back again.
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine	5	2019-12-30	"A little on the pricy side but that's what you get when you dine in Yorkville. The dim sum is honestly very good, surpassed only perhaps in value by the crown princess a little further down Bay street. A few non-dim sum dishes are excellent as well, including their Singapore noodles and Bok Choy. 

Their staff are as professional as they come. A very pleasant dim sum experience"
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine	1	2019-12-24	"Worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant! 
The service was so slow; we got our food after exactly one hour. Also, the server didn't speak English, was aggressive, and had an attitude. 
Moreover, the food was served colder than usual and was extra oily. 
We tried to address the issue to the manager but he said: ""it's okay"". 
I don't recommend even giving this restaurant a try!"
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine	5	2020-03-20	You can truly taste the difference in quality of dim sof Dynasty compare to other dim sum places downtown Toronto.  The dishes are flavourful and fresh.  I highly recommend calling in to reserve a table, otherwise expect to wait 20-30 mins for one.  The only downside is that customer service isnt so great.  Once you place your order, your food will come when dishes are ready.  The waiters will not come check up on you. Ive noticed this when it is a full house of customers.
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine	5	2019-05-09	"Parking here sucks and the place is rammed, but it's worth it. Best dim sum in the area.

We pretty much enjoyed everything we ordered, but here are some of the stand out dishes: 
bbq pork bun (specifically the baked one)
mushroom udon
jellyfish
Har gow
deep fried tofu
Honey black pepper short ribs
(salted) egg custard buns"
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine	3	2019-03-02	"Food was tasty.

Eyelash found in tripe dish.

Guy tried to give us leftovers.

Prices are not available unless you ask. FYI here are the prices."
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine	3	2019-09-21	Dynasty is a decent spot if you're looking for Chinese food in the area. The place is nice inside (given its location in Yorkville), and the food selection is quite typical - similar to those found in other Cantonese restaurants. Nothing out of the ordinary. They offer an evening dim sum menu (a slightly condensed version of the regular dim sum selection). Service is pretty good and food comes out quick.
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine	4	2019-09-15	Pricey but good dimsum. Less fatty and greasy than traditional. Good service. The meals looked good, but I only tried the dimsum
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine	3	2019-04-06	I went for an early dinner and there was one other couple in the restaurant. It slowly picked up with large and noisey families. The good was good. Wontons were a bit greasy but fresh. Dumplings were great. Hate asking for red wine vinegar when I visit dim sum restaurants, as I did here, just leave a bottle on the table next to the soy sauce. Sticky rice was hot but lacked much flavour. No refills on soft drinks. Host was great, server was OK. Nicely decorated room
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine	1	2019-11-09	"I have been here in three years and the quality has definitely come down.

We ordered the chicken fried rice which had no carrots or peas just rice and chicken. It tasted ok.

The sesame chicken was way too sweet and tasted like a chicken Tim bit.

The dim sum was below average for the price. There are definitely better and cheaper options. I a long time customer will not be returning."
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine	2	2019-11-17	"Tried the Dim Sum at dinner time- the quality leaves much to be desired although the food was hot and served with typical efficient minimalist ( they did top up your tea promptly) service. The Xiao long bao was completely dry; Char siew bao was dry and flakey ( below expectations). Pricey for the lack of quality.

Saw that they had Tiger beer which was a pleasant surpise 

We probably won't be coming back again ."
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine	4	2019-07-07	Dynasty serves high quality authentic Cantonese dim sum, in a very nice, high end setting.  We had the traditional, har gow, shui mai, and char siu bars.  We also had the turnip cake.  Portions are small here, but quality and taste were great!  It is very different than Chinatown where the variety is a little larger, but if you come to the Yorkville neighborhood for Cantonese dim sum you will not be disappointed!
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine	2	2019-06-24	"We tried this place since it's close to our hotel and shopping places. 
The ambiance was great and place looks clean. But the service needs a lot of work. The hot and sour soup is terribly spicy and no taste. Just the hot spice. So I ordered another soup. The wonton soup. It took them almost 30 minutes to bring my soup out. And likewise no taste and very UN-CHINESE flavor. 
We also asked one waiter about a cocktail mix and he initially gave me the impression that he does not want to be asked about the drinks and the menu. The waiter said I'll get back it's you but he never did come back. Almost All waiters and servers here are very UNFRIENDLY AND NO SMILE at all. Very disappointing place.!!!!"
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine	3	2019-10-18	We ordered dim sums. They were all very good. But the service was a little slow: we had to ask twice for some tea, twice for the bill, and never got the sauce we asked for. It looks like no waiter in particular was in charge of our table.
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine	1	2018-11-13	It was way over priced for the type of food you get. One particular waiter was very rude (Tony). The other waiters were polite but the ratio of wait staff to patrons was not balanced. We had trouble just getting water or trying to get our bill.
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine	2	2017-12-17	"Last week, I decided to get take out from a nearby restaurant. They said it would take twenty minutes, so I decided to walk around instead of waiting at the restaurant. I had killed some time and by the time I had looped around, I thought hey maybe I can grab one of my favorite treats as dessert. Dynasty was right there, so I went upstairs, proceeded to the counter, looked at their priceless* dim sum menu and ordered one order of the steamed egg yolk custard buns.

I said priceless with an * because I wanted to explain that it didn't have a price next to the items... Not because there menu is super precious. Boy did I ever experience sticker shock. Yes, I do remember Dynasty is over priced and the food is average here. But when I paid over $10 for three tiny buns...I couldn't help but think: didn't I pay just four dollars for three of these, but slightly larger ones, at Rol San a few weeks ago? 

Okay, so maybe the quality is why it's priced higher, I thought. So after eating amazing Indian food for dinner, I dug into the custard buns. The filing is kinda dry... Atop of this, there's some weird film/coating around the ""custard""/yolk. I assume it's edible, because it's in all three, and I ate it. But if I had to compare it against other custard buns that I've had... I'd much prefer a creamy custard instead of something dried up. I don't think of custards as something dried up ever.

There was a time when the buns were good here... Years ago. Its a shame because the other items in the menu here really are average and over priced."
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine	3	2018-08-28	"I brought my dad, stepmom and half siblings here for dinner as they were visiting from Vietnam and craving some Chinese food and I wanted to take them somewhere classier than the Chinatown restaurants.  BIG MISTAKE.  You can take a girl out of Chinatown, but you CAN'T take the Chinatown out of a girl!!! The service was not good. 

First of all, for the area and price point, I expected to be able to ask the servers about the menu but apparently they don't know why is popular or well-liked. Secondly, my dad and stepmom had a quiet hushed disagreement and the server near us started giving them dirty looks. Everything else was based on lack experience from the servers. Appetizers coming out at the end of the meal, lack of napkins despite having three kids at the table, failure to clear emptied dishes.  

The food was pretty good. While it could not make up for the poor service, I would order takeout from them but I will not dine in again unless there are extenuating circumstances."
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine	3	2017-10-14	"We were wandering through Yorkville and looking for something to eat when we spotted Dynasty Chinese Cuisine. Dim sum in the middle of Yorkville? Sure, why not.

We requested a seat on their patio and the waiting began. Our waiter finally showed up with menus a few minutes later but honestly, I was baffled (and a little annoyed) by its vagueness. The dim sum menu is devoid of prices, and since our waiter appeared only sporadically, we had to wait a while before we could even begin choosing our food. (Like, if everything is going to cost $10, we certainly weren't going to stay. And because this is Yorkville, that's absolutely a possibility.)

Anyway, he finally explained the menu and the costs, so we decided to order six items. The food was all fine. There were no really distinctive flavors to be found but everything was prepared relatively well. (We did get a short-rib dish that was basically inedible due to a preponderance of bone and cartilage, however.)

I had to wait a while to start eating, though, because I needed a fork and, surprise surprise, our waiter was nowhere to be found.

With service like this and food that's just barely passable, it's hard to envision returning."
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine	4	2019-05-27	Generally good but the beef belly is actually tripe and it comes out almost immediately which is highly suspicious.
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine	3	2017-06-23	"Dim sum in the heart of Yorkville, honestly coming from Richmond Hill (read: right beside Markham!) I wasn't expecting much. I expected average, bland tasting classics like har gow (shrimp dumplings) and siu mai (steamed pork bites wrapped in wonton-like skin). We arrived as a table of 7 on a weekday and the place was fairly empty - understandable, dim sum usually is a longer meal not favoured for a workday lunch hour. We ordered a bit of everything and some of us were looking for specific items - everyone found what they were looking for! There were a decent variety and many classics on the menu - some that aren't often found even in Markham because they're complex to make and don't sell for high prices.

The highlights were the fritter wrapped in rice roll, the osmanthus cake, and the mini octopus in curry sauce. Often the rice rolls are squishy and lack texture, but this one was a good consistency that complemented the crunchy (not chewy!) dough fritter. The osmanthus cake came with a base layer of coconut milk, providing additional flavour and texture that agreed with the table's demands for desserts that're not too sweet but still *something*. We also ordered steamed sponge cake - it was soft and fluffy, steaming hot. The realization the sponge cake was steamed baffled some, and the softness and light flavour was well received. It could've had more of the signature taste, but it was a decent attempt at the classic.

Overall for the location I was pleasantly surprised, and prices were aligned to the area as well. Unfortunately from a dim sum in Toronto perspective, I didn't feel like it was anywhere close to great and it definitely wasn't worth the price paid. Service was good and accommodating to the non-Chinese speakers, but translations were odd and made it more difficult to understand what things were in some cases. I'll be back for team lunches looking for exotic options and a group feeling because we're all at a round table, but aside that I'll stick with my suburb options."
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine	1	2019-02-21	Came here to celebrate my Friends Birthday, Food is good but for the price its not worth it.service not good. I ask them if they can do something for her like candle and small dessert..And she said yeah we can do that..And I was waiting for it and she forgot and I felt bad that I have to said it infront of my friend when it supposed to be surprise.He said that they don't have anything like that but We saw that they did it on the other table.By the way we paid around $500 for that small portion of food and Bad service!
Sichuan Garden Restaurant	4	2019-08-24	"This appears to be an old school family run Chinese restaurant. Great food crossed with a modest priority on establishment decor.

We had the spicy sliced chicken, pork with vegetables, won ton and hot and sour soup, beef fried rice.  Every dish was really really good. The spicy chicken was wicked spicy and was utterly fantastic!

The fellow waiting on use was confident, very nice and helpful.

Will be back when in the area."
Sichuan Garden Restaurant	5	2019-06-22	"Very cheap lunch specials of 6.99, variety of stews with rice and noodles are amazing. You can always taste the fresh vegtebales which is amazing.

This is not a luxury or beautiful place the food is good quality and cheap.

Don't forget the forun cookie also cash for lunch special."
Sichuan Garden Restaurant	4	2019-05-28	"As newcomers to Toronto the food scene is very new to us, cuz took us here as his previous dining experience had been fantastic. We have been here twice in three weeks specifically for one dish the hot pepper chicken.
They have recently renovated and had no one told me, I would definitely say the place needs an upgrade. Pointy long chair, tables with plastic table cloth considering the greasy nature of the Sichuan food. The menu is ellobrate with enough items for vegetarians as well as those who need their share of meat, pork to fish.
A party of particularly hungry people we called in for the following:

SLICED FISH IN GARLIC SAUCE: Boneless steamed fish, had this distinct flavor of the garlic and could be eaten all by itself. Makes for a great appetizer

BEEF IN BLACK BEAN SAUCE: sliced beef pieces served with peppers in black bean sauce, so well cooked, a light gravy it tastes well with the rice and as an appetizer.

CHICKEN HOT PEPPER: this was the main. Now if you like the fire of the peppercorns, only then you should venture here. It is a big bowl of chicken, napa cabbage, and peppercorns in gravy. Large portion size, must be eaten with rice or it will flame you. Lovely. Highly recommended.

EGG FRIED RICE: serves as a catalyst for the spice of the Sichuan, as the bland of the rice soothes The flavor.

The second time around we decided to explore the menu a little more and called for
MARINATED RIBS: the meat almost melted in my mouth and tastes delicious. It's a good side dish and if you are ok with bones it is a recommended item.

EGGPLANT IN CHILLI GARLIC SAUCE: I have always liked the Chinese eggplant and wanted the cuz and husband to try it so we got this as an appetizer while we waited for the food. Very recommended if you are a Vegetarian or plan to eat vegetables while here.

CHICKEN HOT PEPPER
EGG AND SHRIMP FRIED RICE: They accidently brought this out instead of the egg rice, we were hungry and kept it. Does the job.

I like the flavor of the food and for the chicken pepper we would be returning again. There is a lot that can be done in terms of tables and sitting arrangement, it stinks at times as well. Apart from that the food is great, the service was also not bad. Overall a 3.5-4/5 and does have a repeat value."
Sichuan Garden Restaurant	4	2019-07-18	"If you like your Chinese food to be spicy then this is the place for you. A friend of mine introduced me to Southern Chinese cuisine which she said would appeal to my Indian taste buds. I've been hooked ever since. 

The sliced fish in chilli oil with Sichuan peppers is a must-try! It's very spicy but goes so well with a bowl of steamed rice. We also tried a plate of green (not sure what it was) but it was so garlicky and yum! 

I look forward to going back and trying more items on the menu, the quantity is large so it's a perfect place to go with a group of people."
Sichuan Garden Restaurant	3	2018-11-19	"I come to 川味轩 occasionally and every time think to myself ""oh no looks like they closed down"" because of the state of disrepair of the storefront. 

Once inside, it's the same familiar servers and that awful plaid carpet. The prices haven't changed much over the years and neither has the menu, although I did notice the portions are smaller. I always get the lunch specials Kung Pao chicken, a tofu dish and spicy cold noodles which never disappoints. Lunch specials come with a soup of the day. 

Tasty, good value and a viable option if you are willing to relax your standards of cleanliness."
Sichuan Garden Restaurant	3	2018-11-10	"It looks really sketchy outside but don't like it scare u away, cuz the food is pretty good! Let's talk about the 4 dishes we ordered:

1. Dan dan noodles. Okay I'm pretty sure it is not the authentic dan dan noodles but the way they presented it was pretty smart. All the spicy sauce is on the bottom of the bowl because if u can't take that much spicy then u don't have to stir all into the noodles. But other than that no comments.
2. Chicken dry pot. We ordered this because other three plate wasn't enough. It came on a stove and a pot, it tastes amazing but the fire down the stove is just really concerning I wish they could use some protection around it.
3. Spicy beef. ITS SO GOOD and SO SPICY. I freakin loved it!! I'm not joking about the spicy level of this dish so if u can't really take real spicy u need to bring ice milk with u. Also u need to try the numbing pepper that Sichuan cuisine has, it will numb ur tongue and it is such a cool sensation.
4. Double cooked pork belly. It's extremely salty, like super duper salty. We had to order rice to eat this. 

The service: the waiters and waitresses hang around but they r really slow at services."
Sichuan Garden Restaurant	4	2018-09-27	"Tried this out in a spur of the moment decision, on a trip to Toronto. Excellent Sichuan cuisine. Prompt friendly service. Too bad they don't accept visa (requiring me to have my friend pay in cash, and hence the reduced rating). 

Reasonably priced food!"
Sichuan Garden Restaurant	3	2018-10-25	"TL;DR Delicious Chinese food but not exactly authentic Sichuan. 

We ordered takeout on a Saturday night - green beans with pork, gong bao chicken, and mapo tofu. 

The green beans with pork was a standout, the beans tasted fresh while nicely fried at the same time, the dish could have used slightly larger pork crumbs though. 

The gongbao chicken was definitely not authentic - it was a bit saucy compared to the normal version and the chicken pieces were larger than normal. It was not spicy at all and maybe a bit sweet. It was still tasty. 

The mapo tofu was also a standout - a bit spicy and very flavourful.
 The portions were large and generous. We can't comment on cleanliness or service since we ordered delivery via DoorDash. 

One star off since neither of us felt like it was authentic Sichuan cuisine - too much cornstarch and a tad too sweet. It was tasty nonetheless. Side note, we both had poor stomaches a few hours after dinner. Can't tell if it was from the meal, just figured we'd add in case."
Sichuan Garden Restaurant	4	2018-07-27	The pictures are sour soup fish, cabbage with mushroom, and tofu with sliced pork. The manager really wanted us to pay with cash. But they accept debit card too. It's also pretty spacious and there are many items on menu. WiFi is available.
Sichuan Garden Restaurant	4	2017-08-26	"I went with a friend who recommended this place. I was not disappointed. We both love spicy food and although the food wasnt super spicy (probably because I have a high tolerance to spice) it was delicious nonetheless. We really enjoyed our meal of spicy chicken with chili, mapo tofu and shrimp fried rice. A word of caution though, some people, might find the food a tad salty but for me it was perfect. I love me some salt. The servers were really nice as well. It made the meal that much better. 

PS: place is way bigger than it looks on the outside. I was very surprised."
Sichuan Garden Restaurant	4	2017-11-05	"A Chinatown staple. 

When you're feeling the bright lights of Chinatown, and hunting lazy susans and plastic chopsticks, SG is here for you. 

When you're feeling your couch and are ready to drop $60 on a true Chinese Canadian feast, SG is here for you. 

My fave dishes include: veggie fried rice, spicy broccoli and their General Tsao's chicken."
Sichuan Garden Restaurant	3	2017-12-03	"Location: poor atmosphere, looks like the cliche Chinese restaurant right out of a movie. No eye appeal whatsoever. 

Food: ordered the chicken fried rice and the beef with ginger and spring onions. Being used to eating foods flavored with haberno peppers, we had them make our dishes spicy. The rice was very flavorful and nicely spiced. The beef dish was ok, didn't really stand alone well but mixed with the rice It was good. The water cups looked really dingy, which I didn't drink out of it Bc of that reason. 

Overall: food was good, if you don't mind the appearance of the place, I'd say go for it."
Sichuan Garden Restaurant	4	2017-09-13	"Still one of my favorite original Chinatown establishments. I love the staff here - all bilingual and super friendly and treats you like family, especially if you speak Mandarin ;) Whenever I get cravings for traditional Chinese vegetarian dishes like lotus root, Chinese mushroom and fungus, mapo tofu, etc I come here. I also come here when I feel ""heritage-sick"" and need to reconnect with people who remind me of my family. Many customers here are regulars and know the staff personally. 

They will make all sorts of accommodations for dietary restrictions or special diets, such as vegan/vegetarian, e.g. mapo tofu usually is made with meat so remember to tell them at the beginning that you are vegetarian. 

Downsides are that they put way too much cornstarch, salt, and MSG in all of the mains. I definitely don't recommend the ""Bamboo shoots with Chinese mushrooms"" dish as everything was literally swimming in a broth of corn starch and the bamboo shoot was a bit stinky (as it should be, but just note that it is an acquired taste). I recommend the mapo tofu - it isn't that spicy at all! Also recommend the mixed vegetable stirfry, which contains Chinese black fungus (so yummy and crunchy!) and lotus root. This one has less corn starch and is on the lighter side.

Prices are low - most dishes are under $10 - and portion sizes are large. Rice/carbs do not come automatically with main dishes, so you do have to order these separately.

They accept card as well as cash.

Will be back!"
Sichuan Garden Restaurant	1	2020-02-10	"This restaurant was formerly known as ""Sichuan Garden Restaurant"" and re-opened last year as ""Ten Miles B.B.Q"".  After reading positive reviews about their Dan Dan Noodles and Sichuan cuisine I popped in alone for a quick lunch.  I was greeted with a very confusing menu.   I wanted to order a few sides, but was advised by the server that my selections were too small. She did not suggest any alternatives.  All of the multiple small plates seem to have only one ingredient and no options for combination dishes like a mixed vegetable platter. I am happy to pay more for more content, but $12 for just bok choy? $6 for one small skewer of basic mushrooms? had to call her over twice until she finally helped me narrow it down to Dan Dan Noodles and a mushroom pot. I was hungry and desperate to order anything at this point.  THEY GAVE ME THE BILL BEFORE THE FOOD ARRIVED.  The Dan Dan Noodles were tasty, but after that the server and kitchen staff seemed to prioritize take out orders over mine.  At about 45 mins + from when I walked I had to flag two servers to ask about the mushroom pot I had ordered.  The kitchen staff had only just started the dish! At that point I paid for what I had eaten and walked out.    If you want UNHELPFUL ,SLOW & UNATTENTIVE servers and kitchen staff that (prioritize Uber Eats orders over sit down guests) and don't own up to their mess ups than you might enjoy this restaurant.  I myself will NEVER RETURN.  There are thousands of restaurants in the GTA. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY on this one! P.S. The management was non-existent. P.P.S. THEY GAVE ME THE BILL BEFORE I HAD EVEN RECEIVED THE FOOD!"
Sichuan Garden Restaurant	1	2016-05-21	"Inauthentic and bland. Red flags: No classic numbing spice flavor. Missed the spot on 2 signature dishes so I won't be coming back. 

The cold noodles appetizer was had noodles that were thick and tasted like spaghetti and old lard. No complimentary contents either--you can usually expect some sesame oil or thinly chopped black fungus or something but this was a low effort fail completely. 

The ""mouth watering chicken"" which is a cold chicken dish was sitting in a pool of chili oil and soy sauce (which is normal) but completely lacked flavor and spice--it should carry the sweet flavor of cooking wine, the saltiness of soy sauce and have the savory ""ma la"" numbing spice that makes your lips and tongue tingle. The only thing resembling the classic dish was the fact that the chicken was rather bony and gristly. I had to ask for more hua jiao (si chuan pepper) oil to make it edible 

I'm horribly disappointed and the two dishes cost me $14. It's overpriced at this rate. The decor is austere but rundown (fake wooden footbridge leading into banquet style restaurant that looks tatty) and I guess the fact it was empty on a Friday evening at 9 was highly suspect. Please just go to Si Chuan house cuisine if you're looking for anything nearly close to spicy"
Sichuan Garden Restaurant	1	2019-05-25	Cockroaches running around.  This place is very dirty and the food isn't nice.  I would not recommend unless you are asking for a stomach ache.
Sichuan Garden Restaurant	3	2017-10-01	I am a bit torn by this rating. I would give it a 2.5 if I could. I was a little freaked out my the fruit flies hovering around my table but I put it aside. Hopefully the kitchen is clean, but what can I do about it, nothing. I order two dishes I get at Trizest, a Sichuan place near my home, in Michigan. The Cold Sichuan noodles were good but a bit bland. The portion size of the small would easily feed two. The Ma Po tofu was again, a large portion. It did seem to lack the Sichuan peppercorns and the mouth numbing effect. I'm a fan of salty but it was way salty. I think it was the preserved black beans that put it over the top. My dish didn't come with rice so I had to order some on the side. All in all it was good, but I wouldn't make a pilgrimage here.
Sichuan Garden Restaurant	4	2017-11-07	"Came here with my family for a special dinner, and we all really enjoyed it! We were super hungry and walked in when the place was quite empty, so our food came out within 10 minutes. The ma po tofu and eggplant skillet were our favourite dishes - very flavourful. The kung bao chicken with peanuts and wonton soup were also really good. We were underwhelmed with the seafood and vegetable plate though... The flavour just wasn't that great.

Our server was nice... She came by whenever we needed her and kept our teapot full. They didn't have any dessert options which seems strange to me? Really though, we ate our weight in the ma po tofu, so it was probably for the best that there was no dessert."
Sichuan Garden Restaurant	2	2018-08-17	Sweet and sour soup was good. Dumplings were good.  Our meals were bleh. Had Tsao chicken, which looked very nice but was more deep fried pieces than chunks of chicken.  My spouse had chicken with ginger and scallions which he enjoyed. A friend had some beef dish that was indescribable.
Sichuan Garden Restaurant	4	2015-12-03	"Amazing for a few dishes. Meh for some others. Know your dishes before you order.

Gong Bao Chicken is AMAZING. Best Gong Bao Chicken I've had anywhere.
The fish in spicy oil is good too.

Some of their other dishes, not so much. Came here with some non-asian friends, the stuff they ordered was gah. So essentially, good restaurant IF you know what to order."
Harmoney Chinese Restaurant	5	2018-07-21	"I've eaten here twice with my kids when visiting ChinaTown. They talk about it like it was the best meal of their lives :). And I swear I'm actually a good cook!
The dumplings are delicious. 
It is a tiny downstairs spot that you might walk right by. And I think we were the only tourists.  
But if you want something authentic and inexpensive, I definitely recommend. 
Service is friendly and what lacks in presentation they make up for in flavour"
Harmoney Chinese Restaurant	3	2019-02-05	"I am a huge fan of Xian style Biang Biang Mein. I haven't found a place in Toronto that makes this. Therefore, when I found a picture of this dish on their ad outside I had to try it. It is strange that I could not find a yelp review. However, there were plenty of google reviews on this restaurant.

It's own by a couple and I feel they gear their restaurant to Chinese speaking customers. Their English is quite weak. I ordered the Biang Biang noodles and steam dumplings. I wrote the number down and wrote the English name on the paper. The lady had to clarify what I meant with another customer. They make their dumplings from scratch and have a pretty big menu.

I do have to admit their Biang Biang noodles and their dumplings are not the best I had. However, they are cheaper than other places around Spadina. What I did not enjoy was one of the owner/cook was clearing his throat alot during the time I was there which was very gross because you hope he did not spit on your food. Really, clearing your throat should be done in the privacy of your own home and not your business where they are customers.

The owners are nice but they are more friendly to Chinese speaking customers because they can communicate with them. If you cannot speak Chinese they will serve you but you will be ignored most of the time."
Harmoney Chinese Restaurant	3	2018-07-10	"[FOOD] - 3.5/5
I was highly anticipating my lunch here since I rarely find authentic Xian restaurants (Northwestern Chinese cuisine) in Toronto. I ordered Xian dishes such as the Steamed Lamb Pita Soup, the Chinese burger (Stuffed Pita), and the Northwestern Cold Noodles. My favourite item was the pita soup. The broth was just rich and flavourful... it would go great on a cold winter day. The cold noodles were a super refreshing part of the meal. Lastly, the Chinese burger (with lamb filling) was pretty good as well. The outer bun was crispy, not too thick, and quite delicious. 

[SERVICE] - 4/5
Okay, so I only gave 4/5 because my boyfriend speaks Chinese and the lady also speaks Chinese. She was quite nice and accommodating. It would've been nice if they had more than one server and spoke English. My boyfriend had to translate for the table of 14 next to us who could hardly understand the server. 

[OVERALL] - 3/5
While the restaurant can seem demeaning and unfriendly to non-Chinese speakers, it is a great place to go for highly authentic Xian cuisine."
Harmoney Chinese Restaurant	4	2019-03-25	I was in Toronto on March 23, 2019 and it was a cold day. Everyone said, this winter has been very cold and doesn't get warm as usual. I was walking around in Chinatown with one purpose only.....eating Xi'an noodles here. Xi'an cuisine is not easy to find where I live, Orange County, CA. If I drive 20 miles or more, there is one. Other than that, I don't see much. Having Xi'an noodles has been my list to do when I came to Toronto. I finally found one here. The rating wasn't that high, but what can I say? I tried Lam noodles....yes, it was what I needed in the cold weather. So hearty, so warm and thick/wide noodles were perfect! The lady in the restaurant didn't speak much English (I thought), but I was able to order since she gives you a paper and pen. Clever!
Harmoney Chinese Restaurant	5	2019-07-19	Warm service, generous as hell portions. Very tasty cold noodles aka Liang Pi, highly recommended!
Harmoney Chinese Restaurant	5	2019-03-23	If you only speak English you may feel a bit disoriented here, but the staff are very friendly. The food came in good time, and was a great portion. I got the chicken fried noodles, which were full of flavor. Very impressed and would recommend to anyone who loves noodles.
Harmoney Chinese Restaurant	5	2019-05-10	Super friendly and honest staff. Good food and prices are super cheap. A great place for a casual and relaxing meal! 11/10
Harmoney Chinese Restaurant	2	2017-04-26	"This is yet another restaurant in Chinatown which specializes in homemade dumplings and Northern Chinese cuisine. 

I came here only because Yummy Dumplings was closed for lunch on Wednesday, so I ended up here to satisfy my dumpling cravings. 

I ordered the pork & chives dumplings (boiled) which was so so. The skin was thicker than I'm used to but still acceptable & you get 16 dumplings for $7.99. The XLB soup dumplings came next. It was presented in the usual bamboo steamer and you get 10 small bite size pieces. It certainly wasn't my favourite because the skin was thick & some seemed under cooked. The pork filling was okay but the soup content wasn't very consistent. Some were not replete with soup when biting into them and overall wasn't very satisfying. Also it's typically served with some fresh ginger on the side to make your dipping sauce but they don't here. Maybe their Xian style dishes are what they are best known for but it certainly wasn't the dumplings."
Harmoney Chinese Restaurant	1	2019-05-03	When we arrived the restaurant was empty and silent. We were seated at a table that was sticky and bits of food left on the table. We ordered the Chinese burgers, pork soup dumplings and cold noodles. The buns were stale, the noodles were excessively greasy and had a weird texture, and the pork dumpling meat was fatty. After leaving the restaurant, both my girlfriend and I felt very uneasy, she threw up immediately. I originally decided to come to this restaurant based on the reviews but after my experience I would not recommend this to anyone.
Harmoney Chinese Restaurant	5	2018-08-28	We picked this restaurant without checking Yelp. Given the current rating, we wouldn't have come in. We are pleasantly surprised by their handmade boiled dumplings (pork and chives filling and pork and fennel filling). Both are tasty and authentic. We also have three other dishes. All good.
Harmoney Chinese Restaurant	5	2016-07-02	Really good Northern Chinese restaurant. Came here with 2 friends and got the Lamb Pao Mo, Lamb noodles, and Beef Noodle Soup. They were all super filling, the noodles were handmade and really chewy. I would definitely come here again.
Harmoney Chinese Restaurant	5	2017-10-14	"I am giving them five stars because I know how hard they work everyday and they produce good authentic Chinese food.

The service quality might upset some people, but it won't be too bad. The owners are very friendly, so make sure to choose the lamb peta"
Harmoney Chinese Restaurant	2	2017-08-06	Really disappointed. We ordered two dishes and wait like an hour for the fish. Maybe it is because we did not order the right thing. But generally i would not go there again.
Asian Legend	5	2020-03-05	Better than din tai fung xlb. Very flavorful, you won't even need the vinegar dipping sauce.
Asian Legend	5	2019-08-16	"I was always a bit skeptical when it came to chain Chinese restaurants, but Asian Legend proved me wrong. Unlike many other North American Chinese restaurants that serve greasy, oily, and overly salty food, Asian Legend's dishes are lighter, less oily, and yet they still pack in flavours. The ambience inside is clean, nice, and I like how they give you paper to write down your orders yourself (like in some dim sum places). Portion sizes are just right, and customer service is quite good.

Asian Legend specializes in northern-style Chinese cuisine, with all-day dim sum that includes xiao long bao and other steamed dumplings. The dim sum menu isn't as large as those in other dim sum places, but their dishes are of high quality. Review of some of the items that I've tried:

- Steamed Vegetarian Dumplings: Come in 6 large pieces in a bamboo basket; filled with minced greens and mushrooms - very flavourful.

- Assorted Seafood with Sizzling (Crispy) Rice: They ask if you want the seafood & vegs with sauce to be poured over the crispy rice or not (some people prefer the crispy rice to stay crispy). Delicious dish - the assorted seafood includes shrimps, scallops, calamari, with assorted vegetables (broccoli, carrot, snap peas, shiitake mushrooms).

- Snow Pea Shoots with Garlic: Standard but awesome accompaniment to the other dishes.

- Fried Rice with Diced Fish, Ginger, and Egg White: This caught me by surprise (in a good way) because it's not as oily or greasy as the fried rice in many other Chinese restaurants. It's light, tastes ""healthy"", with a good amount of diced fish, egg whites, small ginger slices, and some vegs."
Asian Legend	4	2019-10-19	"This is a really great place for authentic Chinese food! I've ordered a variety of their foods, from xiao long bao to hot and sour soup to Peking duck. All of it is delicious, it's not the best Chinese food I've ever had but it's pretty darn good and hits the spot.

The atmosphere is great, clean and modern. It looks like a high-end restaurant, but the prices are very reasonable!

Service is generally good, but it kind of depends on the day. That's the only reason I'm holding back from 5 stars."
Asian Legend	3	2019-11-23	Since living in LA and having a chance to go to Din Tai Fung whenever I wanted, it makes it really hard to think anywhere else could be better. This place was authentic and tastes like bistro dim sum. We got the soup dumplings, shrimp steamed dumplings, and scallion beef rolls.
Asian Legend	5	2019-07-28	"What a serious gem. Came here on a David Chang recommendation and was definitely not disappointed. 
Being met with the same apathy and authenticity as any of the best Chinese restaurants in nyc along with only Asian people eating in the dinning room I knew it was legit.
We got some dim sum, pork dumplings, xio long bao soup dumplings, Baby bok choy, shrimp things (pictured) and a seafood fried rice.
So full. So cheap. They have beer and teas. Everything we had we spent like $60? Maybe less. Including beer and tip.
Highly reccomend."
Asian Legend	4	2019-08-30	For some reason you expect good Chinese food to only be served at ugly restaurants. But not this place. It's modern, clean and still serves rather incredible food. Dim sum, seafood, large dishes etc. The only down side to this place is that they have a limited dim sum menu and there are no old ladies to push the food around in carts.  Everything on the menu is super delicious. They have large party rooms and can easily seat groups of 8-10 in their main area as well. Highly recommend.
Asian Legend	5	2019-11-14	Everything was outstanding. Come with a big group and get a private room and try everything. Loved the Dan dan noodles, snow pea shoots, both mushroom dishes, fried tofu. Prices were very reasonable. They were nice about splitting the checks.
Asian Legend	3	2019-04-20	"Not bad but quality control should be supervised.

We order probably once a month and food quality is a hit or miss.

Like today, broccoli was old. 

Some time the beef noodles, the beef is tough."
Asian Legend	5	2019-03-24	"Tucked away into the many food places of China town in Toronto is this place, asian legend. Bruh lemme tell you, this restaurant is legendary, primarily because of the soup dumplings. I've never had them before but was told to go here by a friend. It can be difficult to spot walking down the street so I'm not sure how people would know to go here without being told beforehand. 

Come here for the xiaolongbao(soup dumplings) trust me. Are you stupid? Are you duuumb? They're best fresh and with a little bit of the vinegar they provide. Really good flavour, overall A+."
Asian Legend	4	2019-08-11	"Great variety of Chinese and Taiwanese dishes, pretty good portions. No need to worry about ordering here if you're not comfortable with Mandarin/Cantonese/English- you're given a paper to write down the corresponding numbers of the items you want from the menu. Waitresses were polite and efficient. 

FOOD: I recommend the cold jellyfish salad and any of their vegetables. Hot and sour fish was decent but over-seasoned for our taste. Shrimp dumplings were nicely flavored but skin was too thick and chewy. 

DRINKS: Tea is some of the best we've had at Chinatown restaurants! I also loved their homemade plum juice (秘製烏梅湯)."
Asian Legend	3	2017-12-11	"We had a team member who was leaving work to pursue his dream job and we took him out for lunch. This place was suggested and quickly liked by a few.   

The restaurant managers/owners generally I think underestimate the power of mentioning a bit more details on the menu or at least a server who is knowledgeable about ingredients. In the absence of information I went the safest route of ordering a plain congee and a steamed bun. My order would easily have been more than double if the right information was provided. 

So on the limited items that I could have, my review is not a review per se. One cannot mess up a Congee and a bun.

However the food did not arrive all together and out of respect for others, all of us had to wait. Which resulted in food going cold. 

The congee and bun were as good as they can be"
Asian Legend	4	2018-09-25	"Been to other locations and this one was good for service and being in the heart of Chinatown..we see seeking solace in a familiar menu.

food was tasty but a little heavy with the white pepper with the beef and egg white soup dish.  dishes came out quickly and were large and shareable as always.

snowpea leaves were very tender and young..not woody at all.
pricey for Chinese food in Chinatown but well worth it.

not stroller friendly but thankfully good Samaritans came to the rescue!"
Asian Legend	1	2017-10-17	"Without question the worst cashew nut chicken I ever unfortunately ordered...
Smaller than most restaurants portions, to top it off; $18.01 for garbage food.
There are many WRONGS in this world; a bad meal is pretty low in the grand scheme of things/life.  BUT; a garbage meal is still a garbage meal.  Staff looked miserable, absolutely unpleasant.  I don't need an ass-kissing or TLC at a fast food Chinese restaurant, this was depressing.  Waste of money, waste of time."
Asian Legend	4	2018-08-10	"Pros: Great soup dumplings! Stand out crispy squid and cold middle dishes. A real stand out from the Cantonese places on the strip and a very different style being North Eastern Chinese Cuisine. This spot may unseat my old standard ""House of Gourmet""

Cons: Service was a little scattered and we had wrong dishes delivered to us and had to ask for sauces. 

Recommended. Go for soup dumplings and die happy!"
Asian Legend	5	2018-11-12	"We ordered takeout. It was exceptional. If you're into Sichuan cuisine, this iteration of Mapo Tofu will not let you down. It's spicy, oily, meaty, and absolutely delicious. One thing that surprised us was the soup dumplings. As Xiao long bao connoisseurs, we were expecting a mess of exploded dumplings. However, they came all perfectly intact, still warm and full of soup. While it wasn't as good as fresh (obviously), they were pretty damn good, and were well worth the cost. The baos were less exciting. They were not juicy, and the bun itself tasted off - the texture was strange and not crispy enough. 

All in all, a great choice for authentic Chinese takeout. Will be ordering here for the rest of our lives."
Asian Legend	3	2018-08-29	"Went there with my husband on a Saturday night, and noticed that they don't have many tables for 2-4 people. So you basically have to wait until a table is available. They do have seats on 2 levels. 
The Chinese food was average, nothing special. It's a little bit over priced compared to the other Chinese restaurants that's in the area."
Asian Legend	4	2018-08-15	We ordered three items: number 1, 15 and 18. The soy bean milk is so bland, but the other two are pretty good. I like the environment. Serving time is ok. However, no WiFi available. Cash only for 10 dollars or below. Lots of items on the menu.
Asian Legend	3	2017-10-28	"This was our first Chinatown experience and it left much to be desired. I'll start by saying that the menu is extensive, with over 160 items to choose from. Perhaps we didn't order the best dishes.

We ordered the soup dumplings with crab meat and pork, which were the highlight of the night. Both the Sui Mai and the chicken and cabbage potsticker, which were on special, did not hit home. They were both bland and could have used some salt. The last dish, stir fried Ho Fun with beef was good but the beef had an interesting texture, it had no chew and fell apart in your mouth. I'd say the noodles had good flavour but could have been better.

To sum up, the food was good. It wasn't great, it wasn't bad... it was good. The service was great. Food came quickly and servers were always nearby. If I do come back to this location, the soup dumplings are the only thing that I will be ordering again."
Asian Legend	1	2018-06-02	"Food was ok nothing special. 
The taste was more blend i don't know i thought after reading the reviews it will be a good place but I didn't like the food flavors. 
We ordered a lot of food.
After waiting so long that someone's gonna pick up our order.
To this counts noodle with beef, crispy fried noodles, veggies and dumplings and beef pancake.
Actually I liked the beef pancake and the dumplings.
When we were finished we ordered the bill. 
A lady came with the takeout boxes and then the drama starts I don't know the lady was packing the food and she throws angry the empty plate on the table. 
She got so upset first I thought I gave here to less tip and then I was like no it can't be. 
So she was so angry she went to the other waiters and keep on pointing to our table and she was like angry like no tomorrow. 
I was literally shocked what happen to her.  
Trying to ask but well she didn't speak English.
So I ignored them all of them. 
I don't know maybe she got mad that I couldn't finish my food.
So my advice for this place is nothing special. If you want some waiter getting angry at you for no reason sure go ahead. This place is not recommended from my side."
Asian Legend	5	2019-04-05	This place was AMAZING. We ordered a ton of items on the menu and everything is delicious. We all highly recommend this Chinese restaurant. Yum!
Ho Ho Barbeque	5	2020-05-03	Been getting our Chinese BBQ takeout here for years. Great BBQ duck, chicken and Cha Siu BBQ pork.
Ho Ho Barbeque	5	2020-04-05	Social distancing is in effect.  If I remember correctly you can't go inside the shop without wearing a mask.  People were lining up patiently today near 4:30 this afternoon.  The roast pork all gone.  Grabbed a duck.
Ho Ho Barbeque	3	2020-01-27	"The barbecue meat here is really good, juicy and tender. I normally get the lunch boxes here, and it's very hit and miss here.
I made the mistake of coming here 1.5 hours before they closed. They ran out of veggies, but still had plenty of meat left.

If you get the young dude cutting your meat, you're gonna get much less meat in your box. he's pretty stingy. and I've gone here 3 times, and every time he cut my meat, I got either bad cuts, or very little.

I've gotten roasted duck rice before, and he gives you the bones and rib area, with one piece of breast so you have one piece with meat.

Today I got 2 boxes, No veggies were left. I got 6 pieces of bbq pork and 5 pieces of roasted pork. and whole box load of rice. was so disappointed! barely any toppings, and they had plenty of meat left!! not like they were running out.

argh! the only part I can't complain is it's 6.50 a box and comes with either soup or a can of pop.

Pro tip, come early, otherwise don't come. and hope it's not the young dude cutting your meat."
Ho Ho Barbeque	3	2019-08-20	"Found this on Yelp and picked it cause it had a higher rating than the other shops all lined up serving the same thing!

There were only a few people in line for Ho Ho, but there was a line out the door a few shops down. Probably should've gone to the other place, but this one was ok.

Pork was ok. The skin was still crispy when we got back to the hotel. Duck wasn't anything special. Cha siu was ok. This w all about average for us, although I know our moms would say it wasn't good.

Next time, I'll have to try the other place with the longer line."
Ho Ho Barbeque	4	2019-06-28	"Would give 3.5 overall, but closer to 4 than 3.

Prices are unbeatable as you really cant get any cheaper than 10 dollars half a roasted duck! Service is quick. Fresh meats provided and the roast on their duck is pretty decent, although I prefer it to be a little more roasted in general, but if you prefer your roasted duck to be on the slightly crispy and juicy rather than a bigger crunch with darker skin, this will definitely be a good place to start.

Also got the pork loin drumsticks (not sure exactly what it is in English) and those were just ok. I probably wouldn't order it again as the price for 3 was equivalent to the half duck! 

Rice with one meat is also only a price of $5. Cheap eats cant get any better than this."
Ho Ho Barbeque	2	2019-10-08	I was disappointed with this place for the price they charge their portion is so small I got the duck with rice barely any duck a bunch of cheapscapes the duck was okay honestly the duck at congee Queen was better price and way better taste last time I'm coming here
Ho Ho Barbeque	4	2019-01-20	"Small, cold (in the winter!), drabby looking, and to be honest, a little pricier than average... And yet there's a good reason they feature a line up every time: amazing Chinese barbeque style meat.

What We Got: roast pork, duck wings and duck feet
What We Liked: all of it.
What We Didn't: the lack of heat during long winter line ups...!
What We'll Get Next: they've got curry beef brisket for $10 and I have to try that. Plus more roast pork.
Also got some solid lunch specials.

YOU SHOULD BRING A FRIEND WHO SPEAKS CANTONESE OR READS CHINESE. Tucked away on the southeast side of Midland and Mcnicoll, it's easy to miss. And when you get into the plaza, it's also easy to miss because it's rather  unadorned, and sits next to another Chinese barbeque spot.

Anyway, once you get in.... this is the ultimate NO DECOR, NO FANCY STUFF, NO FRILLS (actually moreso than the grocery store), OG style Chinese barbeque place.

All the signs are in Chinese and they're taped up in random places. They ain't here to look pretty. There will probably be a line up of grannies and grampies and uncles and aunties... And that's when you know the people KNOW. This is good barbeque.

Fast and efficient service.

Cuts of meat were soooo crunchy, tender, delicious.

SOURCE OF MY NEW CRAVINGS.

I'LL BE BACK."
Ho Ho Barbeque	4	2019-05-28	"Let me update my most recent experience under the new ownership.  

I just had a way better experience here than the last time I came which should be noted.  The bbq pork and roast pork were very moist, full of flavour, and the portion was good.  For $7.50, I'd much rather get a lunchbox here, than... ahem... the neighbouring joints.  I like the soup here too.  

Service was quick.  They're back in my good books!"
Ho Ho Barbeque	4	2019-02-23	"Taste: Amazing and authentic. Definitely 5/5 on this. I mostly order bbq pork but sometimes I'll get the roasted pork. Bbq pork has a sweet savory taste to it, while the roasted pork has a crunchy skin with a soft meat to go with it. If you're sensitive to the sauces and tastes of authentic Chinese cuisine, I suggest ordering the roasted pork instead (and try a friend's bbq pork first before committing to it).

Price: Also 5/5. Cheap - what more do you want?

Service: My experinces, despite my lack of Chinese, has been very friendly with the workers. Yeah, the interior sucks but you're literally just there to order and get out so I don't see much of an issue. Though, it is quite unclean considering they serve food.

Portion: Now this is where my 4 star rating comes from. I agree with the other reviewers that they're cheap and the portions are quite filling. However, their MEAT portions are ridiculously inconsitent. Rice is just a filler to make you feel like there's a lot but you're not going there to pay for rice. As indicated by my picture, that day was a great day. Super filled with meat. On bad days it was maybe half of that or even less because they spread it around to make it look bigger. 

In conclusion: Great authentic Chinese bbq for the price and portion OF RICE, but expect inconsistencies with the meat portion. Don't expect to come here to dine and have a nice flashy interior. Go somewhere else to eat. CASH ONLY."
Ho Ho Barbeque	3	2019-10-26	This place was ok. We tried the roasted duck, roasted pork, and bbq pork, and pork tongue. Taste was average. Duck was very hard to bite through. Meats were cut sloppily and some barely cut. Floor was sticky. With so many better options around, probably won't try again.
Ho Ho Barbeque	5	2018-06-04	"This place had given us so much food and it comes with a drink too.
 BBQ Pork, Roast Pork ( Crispy Pork), Soya Chicken and Roast duck.
Pick any meat of a bed of white rice and blanched Chinese vegetables. Yum, right?  YES!

We had a little hard time communicating since my Chinese was so rusty but thanks to previous yelp pics, we were able to get what we wanted. The employees had great customer service as well.Even though, the store opens at 11am, they open at 10:30am and we saw some lines already. 

We got the lunches or platters and it came with a drink for CAD 6.50 per box. My husband and I looked at each other and we were like, that couldn't be right! We saw how much food we were getting and also the drinks too!! No way, but yes we did..

Great customer service+ ample & tasty food+ Affordability= One Very Happy Customer 


Tip: Cash Only and there's barely any place in there to sit down and eat.
What we did, we got the food and went to a park to eat. :D"
Ho Ho Barbeque	2	2020-04-10	"Ordered a whole roast duck. One of the worker says to me that he had to cut the duck inside the kitchen. While I came home and opened the take out boxes, one of the box was full but the other box was half full and there were a lot of ducks's necks to replace the empty space. I have assumed they stole some of the goods part of the duck for their combo rice meal and they make $$$ out of that. No wonder that they had to cut the duck inside the kitchen so that you can not see what they are stealing. I had call my friends and they say the same thing.  The duck was good and you can taste the freshness and was not frozen but you lost me as a customer for life. The reasons why I brought the roast duck from them at that time because the other two Chinese roast meat place in the same area was closed due to Covid 19 and they was the only place open for Chinese roast meat. Words of month travel very fast and your business will suffer because of this unethical practice.
Now I know how they are able to sell the rice combo meals so cheap.
Buyers Beware."
Ho Ho Barbeque	4	2018-10-16	"Quick lunch today while trying to kill some time. I don't know why I've been craving BBQ pork lately, I'm assuming this is what pregnant women go through. I yelped this spot and was thrilled it had 4.5 stars.
This place is takeout only, there is no room to barely stand inside. Plan on eating in your car or sneaking a table in the food court.  You better not stutter when ordering because the cashier is all about fast efficient ordering.  
I'm giving a one star penalty because they don't offer duck in any of the combos. They only offer half duck minimum orders.  I was super bummed. I ended up ordering BBQ pork and soy sauce chicken with an absurd amount of green onions sauce. It sure hit the spot.  I was super jealous of my brother's roast pork order.  The skin was perfect. 10/10. The meat was so moist. For sure next time I'm going to order that."
Ho Ho Barbeque	3	2018-02-27	"FOOD: 2.5 stars
PRICE: 4 stars
SERVICE: 4 stars

I came here after reading many good reviews about how tasty their food was.  I looked for something to grab it home after picking up my adorable macarons at DaanGo Cake lab.


We ordered 3 boxes of meat on rice; one with roasted pork, another one was roasted duck and the last one was bbq pork.  It comes with either tofu or vegetable on the side.  We only chose vegetable because my husband isn't a fan of tofu. You can also choose to have either a drink or soup along with your meal too.  The price for bbq meat on rice is around $6.50-$8.50.  Isn't it a good deal?  The staff was very nice and friendly.  I wasn't sure if they were the owners or not. I really couldn't tell.  I don't live in the area and it was my first time here. 

The portion was generous however the meat was quite dry.  The bbq pork was ok.  It was better than the roasted pork and roasted duck.  The roasted pork wasn't crispy as I expected and there was little meat on the roasted duck.  

As all above, the food I ordered was mediocre or maybe it wasn't my day.  Anyway, the price was good.  Three meals were only $22.50!  It's pretty good right!?"
Ho Ho Barbeque	3	2018-04-12	"This place is pretty much the epitome of ""hole in the wall."" Tucked into a little strip mall, the restaurant is unassuming from the outside and tiny on the inside. There are no dine-in options - it's take-out only.

When you walk inside, you'll be able to see all the roast meats hanging and spinning. If the doors to the back room are open, you can even see the chefs chopping up the raw meat just two meters away. At the counter, you can see some of the side dishes on display, to help you decide what to order.

The menu has a variety of options, including duck, pork, and chicken, as well as sides such as vegetables and rice. I ended up getting the roast duck with steamed bok choy on the side. The roast duck was delicious - though quite messy to eat, due to all of the juices and bones. The steamed bok choy was lackluster.

The food was tasty and the tiny half restaurant / half butcher shop was quite an experience. It's worth a stop if you're craving some meat and aren't afraid of the grittier environment."
Ho Ho Barbeque	4	2018-10-16	"This place was good, I thought it wasn't good because 2 doors down they had a massive lineup.

Luckily for me I tried both. There was no competition on who's food was better.....

For $6.50 a box with 2 meats here is so worth it. The only reason why the neighbors had a huge line was because it was $5 a box. (they can keep their food NOT WORTH IT!)

I had roasted pork and bbq pork..... The roasted was so crispy and moist and the bbq pork was moist not dry at all. Totally worth the extra $1.50"
Ho Ho Barbeque	5	2019-07-08	This place is great! Super cheap and huge portions. A $7.5 lunch box combo will easily last me 2 meals. Taste good too but I'm not picky and don't have much to compare to. Was a little worried about ordering since I don't speak Cantonese but it was no problem. Overall very nice! Will definitely be back. Only wish is for more veggies
Ho Ho Barbeque	4	2019-08-17	I get lunch from here quite a bit, and I usually the bbq pork and duck combo. It's one of the best deals and you get a really good portions. They also give you soup and/or a drink if you want. The quality is pretty good even though the place might look a bit divey.
Ho Ho Barbeque	5	2018-04-21	"I went on a Friday late afternoon, and the staffs were eating. They quickly greeted me and got up to ask what I wanted to get. It was a surprisingly awesome experience at this small Chinese bbq shop!

I order 2 items combo rice of roasted pork and bbq pork, as well as half a duck and it came out to be a little over $20 including tax. What a steal for the quality and portion! While I was waiting, one of the staff offered me to sample their bbq pork..what great service!

I wish I lived close by and I'll definitely patron more often!"
Ho Ho Barbeque	5	2018-04-18	"Pros:
Awesome prices
Honest service

Cons:
Cash only

I think I may have found my new favourtie Chinese BBQ place.  Again, I have Yelp to thank for this find because you would never find this place otherwise.  Ho Ho Barbeque doesn't face the street so it can be tough to find if you're looking for it in particular.

This place is the definition of a hidden gem.  It's a small place nestled in a plaza at Midland and McNicoll.  The place is super tiny, just enough to fit everything in.  There's 2 chairs and a aisle to sit if you really want, but take out is the way to go.

What stands out immediately is the prices.  Most places now charge close to $10 or more for a pound of BBQ pork.  The price here, $7.50.  You're not comprising quality here for the price too.  The meats here are just as good as anywhere else.  You'll find the prices are about 2 to 3 dollars cheaper across the board for everything you usually find at a Chinese BBQ place.

2 things stand out for me the most here.  First, they have a curry beef brisket.  It's hard to find Chinese BBQ places that to curry beef brisket anymore.  It used to be more frequent but most places have stopped doing it.  You get a large order here for $8.50, that's a win.  

Second, the service her is amazing.  I usually get my BBQ pork a little on the fatty side.  When I placed my order, the butcher took a look and couldn't find any.  Rather than try to sell me something I didn't want and pretend it was still fatty, he honestly told me he didn't have any and asked if I wanted to wait 10 minutes for some new ones that would be fatty.  Let me tell you, most places would not do that.  They would of just chose something remotely close to what I wanted and that would be that.  The fact that he was so honest about what he's selling impressed the heck out of me.

The only thing bad I can say about this place is the cash only policy but that's nothing new for these kind of places.

I love Ho Ho Barbeque.  Like I said, it's my new go to for Chinese BBQ and any fan should definitely try this place out as well."
Artisan Plus	5	2020-02-04	"One of my favourite places to get noodles!!

I came here for the first time a couple of months ago and i remembered i ordered the biang biang mian and it was absolutely delish! The first time i came, the place was pretty crowded because it was a Friday night but everything, from food quality to service, was still decent.

I came back a couple of days ago. I'm trying to reduce meat consumption as much as possible and I was soooo glad to see the amount of vegetarian/vegan options they have!! I tried the vegan kudai mian and it was delightful - loved the flavour and the texture of the noodles! Also tried some side dishes: okra cauliflower, tofu sheet, and bon bon chicken. The okra cauliflower was AMAZING. The okra was cooked nicely and the whole dish had a really nice citrus-y taste, 10/10 would recommend! The tofu sheet and the bon bon chicken were served with some peanut sauce which was superrrr tasty. I also tried some of my sister's dan dan mian and i'd say that i prefer the texture of the wide noodles.

Would say the only downside to this place is how small it is and how it's super crowded during weekend dinners."
Artisan Plus	5	2020-01-22	"Amazing noodle shop!

Seating is a bit tight, so not the best winter spot with jackets, but there are some little storage spots found all around. Their decor, on the other had, is on point--and so is their food! I think pretty much anything here is a winner in my book. 

We got the wok cumin che mian, yopo biang biang mian, pork jia mo, spicy stewed beef noodle, and liang pi.
The wok cumin che mian is a nice spiced and savory side dish. It could realistically be considered a small meal if you ate it by itself. 
The yopo biang biang mian has a bit of everything. It has a sweet and savory taste and plenty of toppings for the noodles! I love how they really don't skimp out on the toppings, which likely consists of half the dish! Their noodles are also wonderfully springy. 
The pork jia mo was absolutely stuffed with filing and was delicious! Really great simple item if you're on the go. 
The spicy stewed beef noodle was very nice. The beef fell apart and the broth was savory. It's not a very stand-out dish at this place, as it closely resembles a lot of Chinese beef noodle soup offerings at restaurants--but it's tasty nonetheless. 
Their liang pi is very peanuty and not very spicy, despite what it looks like (at least in my opinion). It reminds me of Thai or Vietnamese style foods and is very refreshing! 

This is an absolutely amazing restaurant for super delicious noodle dishes and at a pretty fair price points, considering the location and quality! They have quite a variety of noodle dishes, so there's something for everyone. Would highly recommend coming here at least once!"
Artisan Plus	3	2020-01-21	"3.5/5 

Came here for a quick lunch since I heard a lot about the Yonge and finch location of this noodle spot. We were quickly sat down and  able to place our order. 

We both got the Biang Biang Mien since it was recommended by the waitress and seemed to be the most popular item from others who came to this place. 

The noodles were interesting given the variety of different toppings that you wouldn't necessarily think go together, but I liked the mixed noodles concept. My biggest issue was that despite there being so many different toppings, the noodles tastes bland and didn't have much flavour to them. It seemed like the toppings weren't cooked enough to bring out the flavours or salted enough to help. 

Overall an interesting noodle concept but I don't think I'd return again."
Artisan Plus	4	2020-01-09	"Pros:
Well done hand pulled noodles
Nice variety on menu

Cons:
Seating is tight

Artisan has been in the North York area for quite a while.  This place is there venture into the downtown core.  This much larger location is welcome addition to the downtown area.  Fans of hand pulled noodles should give this place a try.

As I mentioned earlier, this location is much larger than it's North York counterpart.  However, being downtown, it is subject to some limitations as well.  As with many downtown restaurant locations, I feel the seating is tight.  It's a veritable obstacle course when the place is full and everyone has their stuff with them.  The seats here are all of the stool variety as well.  There's a little slot for some space to put your things.  But with most people, you will not have anything to hang your jackets, bags etc on which means you probably place it nearby on the floor which adds to the obstacle course.

I was actually impressed by the menu here.  They have a good assortment of noodles to choose from here.  Some of them seem like original creations that you can't just find anywhere else.  I settled on the classic braised beef noodle and my wife got the clam mashi.  

As you can see from my pics, the presentation on their dishes here are spot on.  Every dish that came out from the kitchen looked very good.  I have to be honest, when my bowl of noodles came out I thought I was going to have to eat something else after.  The bowl was on the smaller side for beef noodles.  However, they do pack a good amount of noodles in there. It should be more than enough for normal appetites.  Big eaters like I am should definitely consider the extra noodle options.

Taste wise, the beef noodle was on point.  The broth was nice and not overly salty.  Noodles were pretty good with some bite.  They weren't the best noodles I've ever had, but they were very good in their own way.  The beef was tender and at least stewed for quite a bit before being served.  All in all, great bowl of noodles.  My wife's dish felt more like an Italian pasta dish.  If it wasn't for the spiciness and the wood ear mushrooms, you could easily serve it at an Italian restaurant and nobody would bat en eye.  Even the noodles looked like gnocchi!

Service was great overall during our visit.  A little disappointment that they only accept cash and debit.  Overall, this is a great little place to try our if you're a fan of hand pulled noodles.  There definitely some of other dishes I saw that I would like to try next time I'm here."
Artisan Plus	3	2020-01-10	"What did I just eat? lol
I tried their Famous YoPo Biang Biang Mian. It's a random mix of everything. It has a lot of vegetables (potato, mushrooms, carrots, zucchini, egg & tomato) if you want a healthier option. For me, it's not a lot of meat, a smaller portion and not very filling. The hand pulled noodles were good, the right texture, but again not enough quantity."
Artisan Plus	2	2019-12-31	"Tight seating area with not much space between tables, nor to put winter parkas. My friend's seat was more like a plastic stool. Not comfy at all. More of a eat and run place but your tummy might be hungry still. 

The service was good. We got three water refills from the bottle as it was small. 

My dish came out messy and the portion for $14 was small. There aren't enough veggies. The spicy taste was a good quick to it. The noodle looked like gnocchi and it was chewy. My friend's dish came later on as they messed up the order. She said it was ok. Again, one is paying the price for a small portion of food that wouldn't fill up one's stomach 

So definitely I was still hungry before heading to the theatre. 

Verdict- not sure where they are getting the high reviews but it's not worth my time. For $14 plus taxes and tips, I'll rather eat at a food court that would satisfy this Cat-Squirrel's tummy. Bring on the food!!"
Artisan Plus	5	2019-11-28	"Yum! I've been searching for a place that satisfy my cravings for nice, thick... biang biang noodles!! Great value and taste that's all you need, you gotta eat here.

It's just so inconvenient to make these Xi'an hand pulled noodles at home and hard to find a place in Toronto that delivers thick noodles in the right texture and comforting flavours. Tomato and egg and eggplant is not something you typically find with noodle dishes and just love the tomato/egg as it's a staple comfort food in Chinese cuisine. 

This place has it all in terms of what I look for in a good noodle joint, hand pulled, great flavors, GREAT value and complimentary ingredients. They don't skimp out the veggies or give bad cuts of meat like some places do. Love the pork belly. 

I tried the biang biang and beef rib soup noodle. I say the biang biang is a must try when you first come. Beef rib soup noodle is just not as good.

I also try Liang pi combo, so odd that it comes with specifically orange soda. Is orange soda the best complimentary drink? The meat bun, orange soda and cold noodles all together is only $11~. What a bargain!

Quickly added to my favs!"
Artisan Plus	3	2019-08-23	"Another month has come and gone and here we are in the heart of Toronto just doing our thing. We've walked by Artisan Plus many time and we finally gave it a try. This place was buzzing with people around the lunch hour however the wait for a table for two wasn't very long. We waited may be 5 mins.

As this was our first visit we wanted to try a few of the appetizers and different noodles dishes. As such for the apps, we ordered the Artisan Pork Jia Mo which is handcraft artisan bread with chopped braised pork belly and gravy. The braised pork belly was quite tasty however it did get quite messy because of the gravy. We also tried the Shuan Tofu Sheet which was made of fresh tofu sheet mixed with bean sprouts, shredded red pepper, scallion, gourmet chilli, peanut and sesame sauce. This dish had the very slightest numbing spice. However this dish was slightly on the oily side and the tofu sheet were too long.

For our mains, I tried the Famous Yo Po Biang Mian which was ribbon noodle, sauteed tomato, scramble egg, cauliflower, potato, carrot, organic cloud ear mushroom, edamame, grilled zucchini, paparika, and vinegrette. The ribbon noodle was super long which made eating the noodle slightly difficult. However the flavours were different and interesting. Nothing that really made my taste buds dance. There was no numbing spice to this dish. However if you don't eat spicy on a regular basis I wouldn't recommend this dish. My husband tried the Wok Cumin Che Mian with Spring Lamb. Surprisingly the Lamb wasn't super gamey. Again the noodles were all super long and the flavour was okay. However, I still want to try their noodle soup one day. 

The service was on the ball. The waitress was always around in case you needed them. Than again the restaurant wasn't super large. There were probably around 40 seats."
Artisan Plus	3	2019-09-03	"So much hype we had to stop by and try it out. This place is newish to me located near Dundas and Bay and I've seen it being renovated months ago and thought the interior was really hip and modern looking. This is a noodle place that serves Northern Chinese style, the menu is very simple and don't have too many different things clouding your mind on what to eat. 

We ordered the Artisan Pork Jia Mo, and Shuan Tofu Sheet for starters. The pork Jia Mo is chopped braised pork belly with gravy served in a handcrafted artisan bread, this was not bad but flavour was slightly weak in my opinion. The tofu sheets are made from fresh sheets, this dish is served cold and almost like a salad with shredded peppers, bean sprouts, scallions, chilli, chilli oil, Sichuan pepper corns, and sesame oil. I found that the flavour is good not too much numbing spice and not too spicy but boy it did have tons of oil. 

For mains we ordered their Famous YoPo Biang Mian and the Wok Cumin Che Mian with Spring Lamb. the Biang mian has a lot going on with sauteed tomato, scrambled eggs, cauliflower, potato, carrot, woodear mushrooms, zucchini, edamame beans, paprika, and vinaigrette sitting under all these ingredients are some ribbon noodles which were slightly too long. I thought that this dish was a mixed with way too many things and the flavour got lost way too busy. The Wok Cumin Che Mian with Spring Lamb was better and the lamb wasn't gamy but I wish there was more slices of lamb. This dish I found was a little small for the price. 

Service was great our server was very knowledgeable about their product. She kept our water carafe topped with water. The food comes out very quick and displayed nicely. When it came time to pay the bill was ready and the server came with a debit machine as well. Be prepared to bring cash with you as this place is cash or debit only.

I will be back to try some soup noodles next time. Hopefully it will change my mind and get a better rating."
Artisan Plus	4	2019-09-20	"Finally got the chance to try Artisan Plus and it was just as amazing as an expected! First of all the interior is very clean and aesthetically pleasing and the staff are super friendly! 

We ordered the Yo po biang biang noodles and pork jiamo. I was surprised by how many different vegetables (such as the zucchini, the wood was mushroom, potatoes, carrots and the tomatoes and eggs) are in the noodles and how well they complemented each other! The noodles were chewy and really absorbed the flavour well since they were thoroughly coated with the spicy oil. The only complaint I had was that the potatoes were hard/not as well-cooked but that might just be personal preference. The pork jiamo was actually stuffed and very filling - they don't skimp on the meat stuffing - and it was super juicy.

The only caveat was that this restaurant only takes cash or debit so make sure you come ready! 

Will definitely be back soon!"
Artisan Plus	3	2019-09-03	"Artisan Plus received a great amount of hype upon opening on IG and I've been waiting to try it since.

AMBIANCE: 5/5
The store itself is small but functional. The seating is very well designed with ample room in between each table and each chair has it's own cubby to leave purses/shopping bags in. The decoration itself gives the restaurant a really nice modern, chic vibe and great for IG pics!

FOOD: 3/5
I ordered their famous YoPo Biang Biang Mian with Beef: this comes with scrambled eggs, tomatoes, carrots, zucchini, organic cloud ear mushroom, five spice tofu, edamame, and potato. The dish came with thick ribbon noodles which were THICK, chewy, and filling.
The plate was okay but a little underwhelming from how much hype was given. The sauce was a little plain and I was expecting more of a savory flavor. Because there was such a variety I believe they only put a little of each so it makes the dish seem insubstantial. 

SERVICE: 5/5
The service is really attentive here. The server was friendly and advised of spice levels of the dish (my friends CANNOT handle spicy). Water was always refilled and the food came out hot and fast. Bills came quickly and easily split.

OVERALL: 3/5
I feel like this was a solid but average experience. I'll be back in the future to try other things on the menu!"
Artisan Plus	3	2019-09-14	"Overall, an OK noodle spot. Interesting to try out but not a must-try. 

I ordered the Famous YoPo Biang Biang Mian (which the waitress mentioned was their most popular dish) and the Shuan Tofu Sheets:

Biang Biang Mian: The plate is quite large so if you're hungry this is the dish to order. The noodles were pretty tasty/chewy and the beef tasted good but the rest of the plate didn't really stand out and was loaded with vegetables (see picture).

Shuan Tofu Sheets: Again, another OK dish but wasn't amazing. While the flavor is there from the peanut and sesame sauce, the texture of the tofu was off-putting after a few strands. We didn't finish the dish. 

If you're looking for spicy noodles, give this restaurant a try. Otherwise, tons more noodle places to eat around Yonge-Dundas."
Artisan Plus	3	2019-07-28	"Relatively new noodle spot that opened up downtown just at Bay and Dundas. Came by with a few coworkers for lunch and the consensus was that it was okay. 

Even though Artisan plus was packed when we arrived. We were lucky and was able to get seated fairly quickly for a party of 6. 

We were seated on the high top right in front of the kitchen and got to witness the staff in action. It still amazes me how efficient the kitchen works, it's a well oiled machine. 

I ordered the appetizer trio, pork bun, and clam mashi. The appetizer trio was a combo of enoki, bean curd, and tripe. Of the 3 the tripe stood out the most. The bean curd and enoki mushroom were okay at best. The trio comes with dipping sauce that tasted very similar to a peanut sauce. 

The pork bun was shared among the group and we found that although the pork was really flavourful and moist, the bun itself was a tad on the dry side. Not the good kind either. It's worth a try but I wouldn't be ordering this again if I visited again. 

The clam mashi was amazing! I've gotta say I could have done with without the other two items on the menu but the clam mashi is a must. Be warned, it's a little spicy. I would say out of 10, would be about a 7 on my scale. Not to the point where the heat was unbearable and unenjoyable. It definitely lingers and I found myself going through water pretty quickly. The clams were declines in the dish and there was quite a few in there to enjoy. This was my first time having mashi and I'm now a big fan of that."
Artisan Plus	4	2020-01-03	"A solid spot for hand-pulled noodles. I got the wok cumin che mian with beef. There's a lot of well-integrated flavour in the bowl. The noodles have the right texture. Precisely-julienned vegetables are all mixed in so there's a lot going on with each bite. It was labelled spicy but I didn't get a lot of heat.

It's pricey ($16 for what I got) and portions aren't massive, but it sure is tasty."
Artisan Plus	5	2019-05-07	"I have been here twice already after they opened, first time didn't impress me that much, I ordered the spicy biangbiang noodle with pork belly and the pork belly jiamo, they also have spicy oil on the side of u don't think it's spicy enough just ask them to give u the jar. The biangbiang noodle has too much vegetable in it(XD which isn't bad, but I would be much happier if there r more pork), instead of the pork belly which they were claiming on the menu, I think it's more like pulled pork texture, so if u don't like pulled pork texture, go for the beef option. The jiamo is like a bun with lots of meat inside, it's it's very filling I can't even finish it. 

Second time here, the line up is equally long, we had 5 people and they are too tiny to fit us, we had to squeeze and it wasn't comfortable. I ordered the clam mashi noodle which is like a Chinese style gnocchi , ITS SOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have never had mashi like this and I'm really impressed!!! I will definitely come back for more of this!!!!!!!!"
Artisan Plus	3	2019-08-12	"Tried out this newish place at bay and Dundas. The menu describes the food as northern Chinese and simple. While the ingredients are all fresh, I think they've taken the ""simple"" a bit too far. I tried the short-rib beef dish. The broth is basic and does not have much flavour. That said, the veggies were all fresh and delicious. Just needed a bit more flavour to kick the dish up a notch. 

Decor-wise, the place is hip and modern. Staff are all very friendly and can explain the dishes. Food comes out fast. May try this place again and try a different dish"
Artisan Plus	5	2019-06-23	"Sooooooo. Good. No joke, I visited this restaurant and came back for more only 2 days later.

I am so glad that regional Chinese cuisine is exploding onto Toronto's food scene. Don't get me wrong, dim sum is alright, but biang biang noodles are where it's at.

And they are so damn good here. Thick handmade noodles, enveloped in warm sweet and savoury sauce, and served with a generous variety of toppings -- it's just so comforting. I inhaled everything on my plate in record time. I think the $13.99 price point is fair.

The other standout for me was the Shuan Platter ($12.99). It's an appetizer sampler with enoki mushrooms, tofu sheets, and honeycomb tripe doused in chili sesame sauce. Just thinking about the tripe makes my mouth water -- the soft, chewy tripe was the perfect vessel for soaking up the rich sauce. Umami galore.

Pretty much everything else we've tried so far has been delicious, except perhaps the shredded potato salad ($5.99, not pictured). It was a little too vinegary and not spicy enough for my taste, but still complemented the Jia Mo well.

The ambiance is definitely fast-paced during busy prime hours, so come during off peak periods (before 6 pm, after 8:30 pm) to skip the lineups. Service is quite good and, unlike similar restaurants, the servers speak fluent English.

Can't get enough of this place! Try it and thank me later."
Artisan Plus	4	2019-05-01	"I highly recommend this restaurant if you want to try North-West Chinese eats that are different from usual westernized Chinese food (aka fried rice, General Tao, etc.)

My first impression was the interior - very bright and modern with transparent glass stools, unlike other typical Chinese restaurants that run on a warm and cozy vibe. Even though the restaurant looked spacious from outside, it was actually quite tight with limited seats. 

Since it was our first visit, we opted for the restaurant's bestsellers, which were beef Yopo BiangBiang (wide flat noodles) and Pork JiaMo (pork bun). The noodles arrived quickly after 5 minutes with tomato scrambled egg, braised beef, and assortments of vegetables (cubed potatoes, carrots, ear fungus, edamame, zucchini). At first, I thought the combination of ingredients was peculiar; however, it turned out to be absolutely delicious as different flavors really complimented each other. I also enjoyed their chewy ""ribbon noodles""! If you are not able to handle spicy food like I am, I'd recommend asking the waitress for no (or less) chilli flakes since they really added some intense heat to the dish. The pork JiaMo was good as well - the shredded meat was well-marinated. 

We visited a few days after Grand Opening and the restaurant was quite packed. However, service was still quick and efficient. 

A bonus point is that Artisan Plus is vegan-friendly!

I'd love to come back to try other different North-Western Chinese food!"
Artisan Plus	1	2019-10-07	"The food here was mediocre but the service was absolutely abysmal, to the point where I'm not even considering the food in the rating I'm giving. 

The server was extremely rude - I asked for an iced tea (canned drink) upon being seated after a 20 minute wait and the server legit said ""just order your drink when you order everything else"" and walked away, even though it was simply a canned drink that takes 1 minute to take out of the fridge. 

When it came time to order our meal, I asked for the drink again, which the server acknowledged. I didn't receive the drink during my whole meal and no one came to check on us so I wasn't able to reorder. 

When the bill came, they actually had the audacity to charge us for the drink that I never received, and when we asked them to take it off the bill they didn't come back with the bill for over 15 minutes, and didn't print a receipt for us because their ""machine was broken"". 

Honestly I'm not sure if we were charged for it, but a place that would allow their servers to talk to/treat customers like this is definitely not a place that I would recommend to others because it says a lot about the restaurant's values and culture, and the food is definitely not special enough to put up with this kind of service."
Artisan Plus	4	2019-06-10	"Great place in the heart of Toronto dt! I recently discovered XiAn food and this restaurant did not disappoint. They made the space quite fun. Their biangbiang noodles were tasty and I loved trying all the toppings with it. Nice punch with the heat. 

Would return to try the buns!"
Lai Wah Heen	4	2019-11-29	"Located on the second floor of DoubleTree By Hilton hotel is Lai Wah Heen, a premium dim sum restaurant. The restaurant is clean and elegant with original Chinese calligraphy paintings. I have dined here for dim sum on a few occasions, and have enjoyed it each time. However, most recently, I finally tried their dinner menu. It contains a variety of classic dishes and some more imaginative items. They are also now serving casserole dishes. 

Got the Casserole of Lobster, which was a very flavourful dish containing a healthy chunk of lobster, and vermicelli cooked in conpoy chili sauce. The XOXO added a nice spicy kick to it. That was my favorite dish of the night. They also have classic clay pot dishes. I wasn't a fan of the eel one (a little salty), but I enjoyed the chicken and foie gras & minced beef ones. They're priced for four people, so definitely good for friends or family to share. 

Since it's upscale, prices are higher than the average Chinese restaurants. So, I think people need to go in with an open mind that the price is not the same as most of the places in Chinatown or Markham. Overall, what I like about Lai Wah Heen is the consistency of the dim sum dishes and creativity (while remaining tasty)."
Lai Wah Heen	3	2020-05-17	"I give this restaurant three stars. I have been to Lai Wah Heen twice, most recently in January.

Lai Wah Heen is a upscale dim sum restaurant located on the second floor of the DoubleTree by Hilton, in downtown Toronto. The restaurant is spacious and bright, the staff is friendly and the service is excellent.

The dim sum is very good but there aren't many, if any vegetable options so it is quite heavy. Also, it doesn't seem very expensive but the price can increase rather quickly when you purchase a few of the higher priced dishes. The bill was higher when my wife and I went here in January than it was when we took our friend last year for her birthday. We particularly liked the crispy shrimp rolls served with sweet hawthorn sauce and the sticky rice filled with assorted seafood & meat, wrapped & steamed in lotus leaf. The spicy, sweet oyster sauce goes really well with the majority of the dim sum and the tea is excellent.

I will likely return to Lai Wah Heen sometime in the near future. I recommend this restaurant to anyone that likes dim sum and wants experience eating it in a high end setting. Three stars."
Lai Wah Heen	4	2019-08-16	"There's really too many good dim sum places in the GTA so it's really hard to say that this place is phenomenal.  It's located on the 2nd floor of DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel.   I love the ambiance here and it's a great place for a business lunch.  If your office is connected to the PATH, It's really easy to get to; walk towards the Sheraton food court, exit the doors of the Sheraton parking lot that takes you up to City Hall and then its another 5 mins walk.

I've been here many times for dim sum and it is always consistently very good.  A recent reviewer mentioned that the skin was a bit thick on the steamed dumpling.  I have to admit that it was on the chewier side but the shrimp inside was very tasty!  The siu mai and the fried shrimp balls are my favorite!  The dishes are a bit pricey for about $9.50 a dish which makes it even harder to say it's worth it.   But given that there aren't too many dim sum restaurants around the core financial district, I will likely be back.  Besides, everything is expensive downtown."
Lai Wah Heen	3	2019-07-26	"Came to Lai Wah Heen with my family to try out their peking duck as I had received a coupon for a free order. Growing up in Scarborough and being completely surrounded by Chinese restaurants, and being Chinese myself, I've had my fair share of Chinese cuisine. Upon arrival, I knew right away it would be a different vibe as it was located inside a hotel and everything looked fairly nice. 

The staff was helpful and polite though a bit stiff. Nonetheless our order was accurate and the tea was always filled. We had dinner on a Tuesday night so it wasn't overly busy but there were some larger parties dining.

On to the food: so as I said, I'm Chinese and have grown up around eating this food in and outside of the house. We ordered about 9 dishes for 7 people including peking duck, stir-fried beef flavoured with aged mandarin peel, sweet and sour pork w/ lychee, gailon vegetables, pineapple chicken fried rice, soy sauce fried rice noodle with beef and fried chicken. First impressions, the food looked nice but was pretty small portions and cost a pretty penny more than what you get uptown. Not surprising with this being a downtown hotel restaurant. The taste though was really really good. Everything was delicious and had lots of flavour. Presentation was pretty and at the end we ordered enough to feel full though not without a price. 

Overall, the food was delicious, the service was good but price for the amount of food was just a bit too much for myself. They are other options out there for upscale Chinese food that might possibly be less expensive and closer to my neck of the woods."
Lai Wah Heen	4	2019-04-03	"I recently attended a dinner at Lai Wah Heen with 9 others. We had made a reservation with the expectation of having a set dinner, but when we arrived, we discovered the menu we had been looking at online was no longer available. We were presented with a few other options and in the end, we selected one that everyone could agree on. 

This was my first time trying sea cucumber and I'm not sure I'll be jumping at a chance to have it again. The texture was really strange, and it kind of reminded me of chewing on cartilage. Not my favourite, let's leave it at that. My favourite dishes of the evening were the scallops and prawns, the Wok-baked lobster and the fried rice with foie gras. They were packed with flavour and left me wanting more. Every dish was quite good, actually - those were just the standout ones for me. 

The dessert was a bit weird, based on comments from a few people in my group. The dessert trio included a soup that consisted of sweetened red bean, which is quite typical for a Chinese dessert and there was a sesame ball with taro inside (I loved this) and a strawberry jelly roll, which I didn't really care for, and was apparently the strangest item in our entire meal, after a very interesting conversation about Chinese desserts. 

Service was really good. There were a few people taking care of us, which helped speed things along when it came to plating the food. They would first bring the large platter to our table so we could see (take photos!) and then swiftly move to a serving cart beside our table and divided everything up between 10 dishes. I much prefer this to letting us serve ourselves, and I wish more places would do this. It takes away any chance of someone feeling slighted if, for example, they didn't get the lobster claw, or the 'best' piece of chicken. 

It was a pricey meal, at $100 per person - plus tax and tip (not including any drinks you ordered) and it's definitely not somewhere I'd be going often, but it was a nice way to spend a few hours. I would definitely recommend it if you wanted to splurge on dinner."
Lai Wah Heen	2	2019-05-07	"We came here for Peking Duck around late lunch time and ended up getting dim sum.

Steamed barbecue pork bun: yes! Get this! Flavorful and light. I also enjoyed the pork shrimp and scallop siu mai.

Average items: deep fried mini shrimp ball

Things I didn't care for: deep fried dumpling of Berkshire pork and baby shrimp (tasted like a sesame ball with a filling), baked mini egg tart, steamed soft bun filled with custard, tapioca lychee and mango in chilled sweet soup

DO NOT GET: steamed short spare rib in garlic and toasted garlic. This dish was horrendous! It was slimy!

We weren't too impressed so we left to have another meal around the corner."
Lai Wah Heen	3	2019-06-02	"Lai Wah Heen used to be the best luxury dim sum restaurant in downtown Toronto. Overtime, the quality of the restaurant declined. While services and atmosphere still remain the same, quality and price are no longer on par. 

Out of the four items my brother and I shared, the best item was fried bean curd sheet with mushrooms served with aged balsamic vinegar ($5). It was crispy and juicy. Truffle Snow pea vegetarian wrap was unfortunately subpar ($5.5). The snow pea is not picked and over-steamed. 

With that said, it may still be a good option if you are a downtown dweller. However, I would not recommend Lai Wah Heen if you have access to dim sum restaurants in uptown Markham and Richmond Hill."
Lai Wah Heen	2	2019-07-11	"First of all, let's be clear. Growing up in Asia, I have tasted the best of the best! So I'm not easily impressed by Chinese restaurants overseas. Lai Wah Heen came with rave reviews by Canadians, so I thought I'd check it out and see how it measured up to restaurants in Singapore and Hong Kong.

Verdict - Lai Wah Heen, which is supposedly 5-star here in Toronto, has dim sum that any 3-star restaurants in Singapore (eg. Mid-tier Wah Lok would win hands down) and Hong Kong can easily beat.

The presentation was nice. The taste profile of some of their offerings were decent, but there was only ONE stand-out dish that wowed - and that was the lava custard buns, which were flawlessly executed.

My biggest complaint was the skin on the steamed dumplings. The skin was too thick (especially the lobster dumpling) and chewing through it was laborious.

Overall, it's not worth the price."
Lai Wah Heen	3	2019-07-09	"Dinner:
Peking Duck, 2 courses
Spicy Shrimp hot pot with vermicelli
Shrimp with black bean sauce

I had not been to Lai Wah Heen in several years, until recently.

The two course peking duck was definitely better than in a normal restaurant. I could tell that the flour wraps were of much higher quality than normal. Perhaps made fresh at the restaurant? 
They serve it with the duck, cucumber, green onion already on the wrap, then you can add the sauce on your own.
The second course was a pretty standard version of the lettuce wraps.

Spicy Shrimp Hot Pot with Vermicelli was excellent. I would order this dish again without question. The clear vermicelli noodles are a great compliment to the spicy sauce and large shrimp.

Shrimp with black bean sauce was good, but did not stick out as much.

Overall, it was a good meal, but the prices are prohibitive."
Lai Wah Heen	3	2018-06-17	"Lai Wah Heen offers excellent service and good food. The prices are higher compared to restaurants in Chinatown nearby, but you are paying for better service and food. 

The service is always great here. Servers are attentive and friendly. The atmosphere is casual. Overall, I enjoy most of the items I've had here. You will not leave disappointed if you have a dinner here. The service and food are both great. 

However, I am only giving it a 3 stars because I think the prices are high for what you get. Yes, the food is better than some of the cheaper restaurants in Chinatown. However, it isn't anything exceptional to me for the price they charge. It is priced higher because it is in a great location perhaps. For the prices here, I am expecting more unique items."
Lai Wah Heen	5	2019-12-01	The service was really courteous and attentive. The food was really original and tasty with a really authentic feel. A nice calm atmosphere if you are looking to get away from the crowds. Dim sum is top notch and  is made in such inventive ways! Desserts are inventive and light--yummy!
Lai Wah Heen	4	2018-01-04	"Regardless if you're Chinese food purist or a new age Asian fusion maven, you'll probably find something here that you'll like. 

Keep in mind you are dining in the double tree, so you will be paying for everything from the food to the service. 

I made a reservation for Christmas Eve dinner and it was quite busy. The star dishes here are really the Peking duck or lobster if you're having a big dinner party. The lobster can be cooked in two different styles, so I would opt for one fried and one steamed so you get some variety. The pork belly here is incredibly tender and the best I've had so far. I would stay away from the dim sum platter, as it leaves much to the imagination. However, their specialty dim sum seem to be a hit, so that may be something I'll have to come back and try. 

If you are parking in the hotel underground lot, the restaurant will cover part of the cost!"
Lai Wah Heen	2	2019-06-08	Stopped by on a Sunday for some dim sum, having visited previously ~6 years ago and recalling an enjoyable visit. Lai Wah Heen is on the second floor of an aging Doubletree Hotel in Chinatown. The hotel has seen better days, but the dining room is fine and clean, if dated. Our experience with the food on this visit was quite mediocre. While nothing was off putting, the flavor and quality were not a good as we had remembered, and certainly a far cry from our best dim sums in China/HK. Honestly, there were no clear highlights. Service was above average for a Chinese venue, i.e. you don't have to flag down a waitress, but nothing to write home about. While we are out-of-towners, believe there are probably better options for dim sum.
Lai Wah Heen	5	2018-09-01	"This was the best dim sum I've had in a very long time. It is the most authentic HK dim sum for all the dishes I ordered. After having a mediocre dim sum recently I was very Happy to have come here. Only thing is that I don't live here... 

The steam bao bun was fluffy and had a decent amount of filling. The egg tart was my favorite as it was warm and the custard was nice and rich. The pork belly was an additional bonus. Will have to come and order the Peking Duck on my next visit. Service was great too!!!

Highly recommend. A tad pricey but worth it in IMHO. Can't wait for my next visit!"
Lai Wah Heen	4	2017-10-10	"My aunt recommended Lai Wah Heen Chinese Restaurant to us. There was options to order set menu (set price per person) as well order al carte options. It wasn't your typical dim sum restaurant as it didn't have push carts.

We ordered hot tea and shared eight dim sum dishes including Roast Pork Pastries, Steamed Shrimp Dumplings, Sticky Rice with Meats and Vegetables, Minced Beef and Mandarin Peel in Rice Roll, Chicken and Truffle Dumplings, Steamed Pork, Shrimp, and Scallop Siu Mai, Minced Beef Siu Mai, and Deep Fried Dumplings Filled with Berkshire Pork. My favorite was the Roast Pork Pastries but all of them were yummy and I'd order them again."
Lai Wah Heen	5	2018-10-03	High quality, fancy dining with some of the best dim sum I've had in Toronto. The interior was quite elegant (inside the Double Tree Hotel), service was very attentive, and every single dish was delicious.
Lai Wah Heen	4	2017-09-08	"Lets face it, dim sum can be a stressful experience. The waiting, crowds, loud noises and rushed service can all be off-putting. It may be a big price to pay for those delicious Chinese tapas that we call  dim sum.

Some may argue these unpleasantries are part of the quintessential dim sum experience, but I disagree. I don't like crowds and I don't like noise, so typically I stay away from dim sum. Lai Wah Heen is an exception to the typical Dim Sum experience.

Dim sum at Lai Wah Heen is more like a High Tea experience. It's mostly calm and soothing. The service is impeccable with attentive uniformed waiters. The ambiance is upscale with white tablecloth and minimal ambient noise. 

It's pricier than average dim sum. True. But you get what you pay for. All the dishes are very good. The clay pot eel rice is delicious as is the steamed bean curd sheet wrapped with mushrooms. My gf's favorite dish was the steamed chicken with fish maw in rice wine sauce.

Now that my mother lives in condominium close by, Lai Wah Heen may be my new go-to for some ""peaceful"" dim sum. It may be more expensive, but it's worth it in my opinion, since I only get dim sum occasionally."
Lai Wah Heen	5	2018-08-16	"Very elegant dim sum. We had the tasting lunch. 2nd order at 50%. 
I ate here over 15 years ago and looked forward to eating here on my return to Toronto.  The restaurant did not disappoint.
Deep-fried prawn coated with shrimp mousse & scallop, wrapped with bacon and the seared crab claw, shrimp & green chive in wonton were both outstanding.
I can't wait to return to Toronto to eat here again."
Lai Wah Heen	5	2017-08-01	"I'm surprised to read all these contrasting, love-or-hate reviews about Lai Wah Heen as I was fairly impressed with my experience here. And this is from someone who comes from a Cantonese background, grew up with dim sum flowing through my veins, and, as such, is very picky and demanding about it.

Yes, the setting in an otherwise aging hotel building (if the public areas are any indication) might not be the most inviting at first, but when you step inside, the first thing you notice is the clean, well-maintained venue that actually looks like a formal dining room - unlike the average unkempt dim sum house. Next, most of the staff appears to be native Cantonese speakers, which is always reassuring in terms of authenticity (although they do speak Mandarin, as many customers insisted). Perhaps, as someone who could speak Cantonese myself, I got friendlier and more engaging service than others would.

Although I got quite the sticker shock when I first reviewed the menu, I was also pleasantly surprised by how well-presented each item was. The lobster and shrimp dumpling, for example, came in the shape of a lobster, and had good chunks of seafood inside. The deep-fried prawn and scallop wrapped in bacon? Exactly as delicious as the description suggests. A steamed beancurd roll of mushrooms and truffle simply rose above typical dim sum fare. Meanwhile, the crispy fried pastry of foie gras and minced pork was also inviting in terms of its presentation - indeed, French-inspired - and also satisfying going down. Dim sum staples like the shrimp dumplings (har gow) and beef rice rolls (cheong fun) were also on point.

Furthermore, while it's all not going to be the best-tasting, best-value dim sum ever, nothing tasted bland or bad either. Just... decent. In another reassuring sign, I experienced none of the suffocating thirstiness afterwards that you'd get from lower-quality dim sum houses that douse their offerings with MSG or salt. Again, another check mark in terms of quality.

Given the effort they put into the presentation and the quality of the ingredients, I was quite satisfied with my visit here, even if it was quite expensive. Is this going to be a cheap, everyday dim sum experience? Absolutely not. But is this going to be a special treat that rises above the usual loud, busy, run-of-the-mill-quality dim sum hall? Absolutely yes."
Lai Wah Heen	4	2018-10-24	"If you are looking for more fusion dim sum, this is the right place for you. Really love the foie gras tart, the lobster dumpling is pretty good. Didn't like the turnip cake and caviar dumpling as much. Ordered the deep fry veg bean curd roll that's really good too forgot to attach the picture here. The truffle chicken dumplings were okay.
It's a little pricy compare with other dim sum restaurants. 

I would say the food is 3.5 stars but the price of the parking and service made it to 4 stars. 


The parking is cheap as it is located in downtown."
Blooming Orchid	5	2018-08-26	"I went to Blooming Orchid restaurant for some takeout food. Blooming Orchid is an Asian fusion restaurant that replaced Duckee restaurant. The staff was very friendly. It took a long time to order as the menu is very cluttered and confusing. They have Chinese food, sushi, dim sum, etc. Normally when a restaurant have so many choices, the food is terrible. The prices were pretty high as their dim sum dishes cost 5 dollars a plate.

I ordered the dim sum no.1 platter which has steamed spinach hai gow, shrimp hai gow, and fried shrimp rolls. I also ordered the salmon rolls. To my great surprise, the food was very good. The fried shrimp rolls were great as it wasn't overcooked. The salmon rolls were also very good.

Would I go back? Sure as the food was very good."
Blooming Orchid	4	2020-03-19	We have ordered from this restaurant numerous times, and we were very satisfied on every occasion. They have sushi, salads, soups, Chinese food, and lots of other yummy options to satisfy your hunger. This is a solid bet if you are craving Asian food in the area.
Blooming Orchid	4	2020-01-03	Yes I gave four stars for AYCE for the most affordable price. The food is above average and service is ok. But for the price of less than $20, you can't go wrong with all you can eat.
Blooming Orchid	4	2019-10-14	"We regularly order through a delivery app and I'm yet to be disappointed.  Price point is a bit higher, but I know I'm getting quality food so I'll pay.  Dim sum and Chinese options are what we've always ordered to date and they've been excellent.  If you're looking for fast food Chinese, this is the place. 

Dim Sum has always been perfectly flavoured and steamed, it arrives fresh and still hot (I burned my tongue and learned that the hard way).  Don't know if they make this onsite or if it's pre-frozen and steamed onsite, but it works.  $35 for a tray to share with 2-3 people is pretty good for the area- I know you can get cheaper and better in Markham and Mississauga, but if it's 8pm on a Thursday night, I'm ordering in. 

Chinese food, whether it's General Tso's chicken or a tofu based main or Singapore noodles, flavours are always well balanced without being overly sweet or overly spicy.  Fried rice is always a go-to and never fails to disappoint. 

Looking forward to going in person and checking out some of the other options!"
Blooming Orchid	1	2019-11-01	NEVER ORDER FROM THIS RESTAURANT! We order from them at least 10 times a week, from our staff to our agents. And today they showed us how POOR their customer service is. We got food poisoning from their food and one of their employees called us disrespectful names. When we walked over to talk to the manager, one of their employees lied and said he was the manager AND the owner - told us he doesn't believe us and that we don't ever have to order from them again because our money doesn't keep their business open. THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! Save your money and order from a place you would feel valued as a loyal customer instead!
Blooming Orchid	5	2019-05-29	"Run don't walk! 

Blooming Orchid really lives up to the hype. 

I was looking for a new AYCE midtown and found one thanks to Yelp and other reviews!

I will post pics below, the food was fresh, portions were perfect, and the taste was excellent.

The service from Qing nan was flawless, her kind, sweet, and helpful disposition made it an absolute pleasure to dine here during lunch hour. She was working the floor, taking care of all the tables, preparing the deliveries, and taking payment for take-out orders, and still her service was great, jus

They have been open for 7 months now, and they definitely have the right combo, of staff, food, and atmosphere to be around for a long time to come.

The decor was simple, relaxing, and comfortable. The washroom was immaculate and again simply decorated closed off by a frosted swinging glass door to access the area.

Will definitely be back, looking forward to it! 
Did I mention lunch buffet was $15.00 Mon-Thurs"
Blooming Orchid	4	2019-01-19	"It was a cold and windy Friday night, so we were looking to order in some Asian food but I was in the mood to try something new. Lo and behold, I discovered Blooming Orchid on one of the food-delivery websites and later learned that it replaced the horrible, bottom-of-the-barrel Duckee.

The ordering process was easy and the food was here within a half hour, and, far more importantly, everything was still impressively hot.

We decided to share the Szechuan Sauce with Chicken and the Vegetable Pad Thai. Both dishes were definitely a cut above most delivery Asian places in the area, for sure. The Chicken dish contained a healthy assortment of veggies (although the broccoli could've been cut into smaller, more edible pieces), and the Szechuan sauce was tangy and surprisingly spicy.

The Pad Thai was equally good and certainly better than the version you get at most places around here. It didn't have the sweetness that seems to plague most adaptations of the venerable dish, and even though we ordered it without a protein, I still found it to be a very satisfying bowl of food. (I will say that the portion was mostly noodles; where were the veggies?)

Blooming Orchid has instantly become a new go-to for delivery in this area."
Blooming Orchid	5	2019-05-17	When it was brand new there were occasional small problems with the kitchen. For example, appetizers not preceding mains, and the occasional not-quite-hot-enough dish. All that is now in the past. The food is consistently very good, and the prices are more than reasonable. I worry the place will fail for lack of business.  It is never busy at lunch time, and it certainly deserves to be packed all the time. Great value for money.
Blooming Orchid	4	2019-03-31	Quick delivery. Everything was nice and hot. The garlic eggplant was sooo good. Pad Thai was average... could have used more sprouts and some peanut. Ordered a curry and a beef dish. Both good. Both came with steamed rice which isn't clear from the menu so no need to order extra rice as I did. Will order again. Eggplant on repeat!
Blooming Orchid	5	2019-08-29	We were on our way to a friends house for the week and stopped in for a little dim sum. The Tom yum soup was fresh and the vegetables were crisp and tasty. We also had the shrimp spring roll, steamed shrimp dumplings and fried pork dumpling.  All were the best we have tasted in a very long time. In addition there was another patron in the restaurant and had been there many and said very was delicious on the menu. Best part it was reasonably priced and no MSG Thank you Blooming Orchid
Blooming Orchid	4	2019-02-02	Got delivery from here. Ordered the Malaysian fried rice, the eggplant dish and spicy fried chicken. The eggplant came with a side soup as well. We actually really liked everything we got. The delivery was fast and free. I think we have found a new take out/delivery favorite in the area.
Blooming Orchid	5	2018-10-18	I've eaten from here 3 times, first 2 times ubereats. Had both pad thai's and the green vegetable curry. The curry (eaten in house) was amazing! The food tasted much better eaten in the actual restaurant as is usually the case. Good vegetarian options, fresh, clean place. Tasty, reasonably priced pan Asian cuisine.
Blooming Orchid	5	2019-02-24	"Love this place! We went there when it first opened and have been going back regularly, as well as getting take out.

Staff are super friendly and flexible, if you want to make substitutions. We've tried their sushi, fried rice, noodles, dim sum, and poke bowl and liked it all. The BBQ pork buns are delish too!

Usually when a restaurant does a bunch of different types of food, it's a red flag, but not here."
Blooming Orchid	4	2019-01-10	Great service and very extensive menu. I really loved the Shanghai noodles and actually ended up ordering them via Uber eats the day after I ate here for the first time. The pan friend pork dumplings had a thick skin and weren't to my liking but those noodles I would come back for any day. Yum. My friend did the all you cat eat menu and all of her choices looked delicious and she said it was all great.
Blooming Orchid	5	2019-07-13	After years of Chinese food drought in our vicinity we finally found fantastic food. The food was tasty and well prepared. A first was that the chow mein kept the sauce separated from the noodles so that they didn't get soggy. We will definitely be returning.
Blooming Orchid	5	2018-10-06	Great place. Try shrimp tempura. Defiantly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to enjoy great dinner or lunch.
Blooming Orchid	5	2019-01-16	Friendly service, quick delivery and delicious sushi. Try the salmon roses and dragon on fire roll! A new neighbourhood gem.
Blooming Orchid	5	2018-10-17	We've ordered twice over the past week. It's their Opening Month 10% Discount. This is just a bonus. Ordered three different combinations of Poke. Incredibly fresh and beautifully arranged. Three different rices available, too.
Blooming Orchid	5	2018-11-11	This is the best sushi place I have ever tried in my whole life. The dragon on fire sushi was very tasty and full of ingredients, the wonton soup is the best for hangovers, edamame comes salty, the deep fried cheese wonton was so good me and boyfriend finished the whole portion in less than 5 minutes, the green dragon roll came with fresh avocado and a delicious taste, the shrimp tempura lunch was crispy, and the miso soup was a little bit simple but it has several pieces of tofu inside and It might be just personal taste. All the portions were big, and for the prices the food is amazing. It's definitely a great place if you want to eat great food for a fair price. It's better if you call them to order cause they don't charge for delivery if the bill is more than 25 dollars, and they currently have a 10 % off discount because of their grand opening. Again, completely amazing I assure you it is worth it.
Blooming Orchid	5	2018-09-08	I am a new to the area having moved from old China town.  I was very disappointed with the choices in Asian food in the Neighbor. I have had three meals from them takeout.lunch lots of tasty specials very reasonably price.  All our food has been fantastic. Tried Thai Sushi and Chinese all the dishes are great and the service is very friendly and good.
Greedy Duck & Noodles	5	2019-12-29	Doesn't look like much but my friend and I decided to give it a shot based on amazing reviews and we were super pleasantly surprised! I got the dried noodles and the taste with the sauce was amazing. My friend got the soup version and she said it was amazing as well. Definitely coming back.
Greedy Duck & Noodles	4	2018-09-19	"The most authentic Wuhan dry noodles ive had in Toronto! Eat it while its hot and fresh.  

I heard about this place from an article on wechat. The article calls for the duck wings as the must-have. Unfortunately the wings were sold out on the day I went. Instead, i ordered the duck legs. The other reviewer's right, it really is meat-off-the-bones; very tender and flavourful. You can really taste the spicy kick from the seasonings. 


这家做出了超正宗的武汉热干面。从一篇微博看到了这家店，说是ta家鸭翅超级好吃。当时就是奔着鸭翅去的，但他们卖光了。。点了热干面和鸭腿。麻辣味十足，肉很酥很嫩。芝麻酱好香~回味中~"
Greedy Duck & Noodles	4	2019-06-23	"So many unique flavours and must try items! 

First of all, I could eat the hot dry noodles every single day. I would not leave without at least trying the noodles. The sesame undertones were perfect, and the noodles had a great kick to them.

I don't think you can really go wrong with the duck wings, legs, or neck. All three are similar yet very different. I found the wings spiciest, but not every one at the table agreed with me. So perhaps there was just a very spicy wing or two. I personally prefer the legs as they aren't as ""bony"" as the legs, but the flavour is so bold on both that both are worth a try. Very strong flavours of anise and Sichuan peppercorns throughout. The pork necks are similar to oxtail in the fact that you need to work around little bones, but they make for a pretty perfect salty snack. I would probably recommend sharing them."
Greedy Duck & Noodles	4	2018-07-23	"Tasty! It's impossible to walk by this store without first noticing the sweet smell of duck that drifts out of its doors. Drawn by the scent and my curiosity, I came here on a Monday evening not sure what to expect and I left pleasantly surprised.

The restaurant mainly focuses on duck and noodles and gets both of these things right! I ordered the 6 piece duck wings and a hot sesame dry noodle bowl. The duck wings are seasoned in a spicy, sweet dry rub that's flavored with Sichaun peppercorns which lead to a mild numbing flavor after you've eaten it. The duck wings were moist and tender, almost falling off the bone although this was after they were heated up (the restaurant serves them cold). The sesame noodles were nutty and a little spicy (less than the duck) and worked well with the duck.

Other offerings on their menu include duck feet, neck, head, leg, tongue and other parts of the duck as well as a small bubble tea menu. Although I kept to the safer option with the wings, I'm sure the other parts of the duck could be tasty as well, though definitely suited to the more adventurous! The interior has lots of seating and it looks like there are plans to have a backyard patio space. The service was fast and friendly! Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area."
Greedy Duck & Noodles	2	2019-04-29	Maybe I didn't know what to expect but the wings are served cool and are mostly skin and bone. Did not do it for me. The noodles were hot and flavorful but the sesame texture is quite chalky and I didn't find myself wanting to eat more than a few big bites full. Mostly just noodles, a little sauce and some garnish.
Greedy Duck & Noodles	5	2019-08-15	This is a casual family run restaurant. It's homey and simple. I found the dry noodles quite tasty and in particular I also liked the tofu. The family is quite friendly and they tend to be helpful. I would best describeThis as a tasty ethnic family run business. I do think the Teays and the dishes are uniquely Asian, but that's a good thing. The food also taste quite fresh to me
Greedy Duck & Noodles	5	2019-03-16	Very tasty and unique flavours. This has become a weekly go-to place. The dry noodle is delicious, so are the dumplings and the noodle soup. Can't really go wrong. The duck is also a hit and reheats well. :)
Greedy Duck & Noodles	4	2019-10-12	The dry noodles are pretty good, super strong sesame flavor. The wings are served cold which I wasn't prepared for so I ended up taking them home and heating them up later. Tasty either way.
Greedy Duck & Noodles	5	2018-09-07	"This is hands down the best noodle place in Toronto!! The Beef Hot and Dry Noodles are delicious and perfect, and the portion sizes are big and leave you very satisfied. They also have bubble tea! 

I have gone here many times for lunch and dinner and each time the service was amazing and the restaurant is very clean. It is also in a trendy area of the city that has a lot of cafes. They also sell duck neck and duck wings, which are very famous delicacies in China, this is the only restaurant in Toronto I know that makes them and it is delicious!"
