Swatow Restaurant,4,2019-07-22,"Noods, noods, noods! Swatow has all the noodle options and you can't go wrong with any!

Tried the egg noodles with shrimp wontons and shrimp dumplings. The noodles are chewy, the soup comes out hot and the veggies are cooked to perfection. The wontons are a must!

The majority of the tables were taken the few times we popped in. There's a wait if you don't want a shared table, but doesn't take more than a few minutes since most seem to be in and out and they're very quick with service."
La Chingada,3,2019-09-14,"Good tacos but Seven Lives is still King. Expensive tho, about $70 with 2 drinks and tax and tip. Not sure id be hurrying to go back. 

I'd check out Good Hombres, Gus Taqueria, and Seven Lives first."
MEXITACO,3,2019-11-10,"Been visiting this place since it was on Bloor, so I'm obviously a fan. 

The food is excellent, and continues to be so, with the exception of the guacamole. It's very smooth and soft, not chunky at all. I find it to be overly citrusy, with lack of garlic taste. Reminds me of store bought super bright green guacamole that never seems to go bad . Skip the guac, and just smash an avocado at home. Everything else I've tried here has been great (tacos, tostadas).

The service has never been amazing, but has declined significantly. On my last visit, we weren't given water until 20 minutes after we were seated. Cocktails took a whopping 30 minutes. It felt awkward and kinda embarassing to try to emphatically wave down the uninterested server. After food was brought out, we weren't checked on until, once again, I found myself waving down server for our bill.

Long story short, when I received the bill, I expressed my concern with the service. The explanation honestly pissed me off. They said the service is messed up because they have too many Uber eats orders. I told him you can't have Uber eats impacting your dine in patrons, but apparently you can. We live in a new world where restaurants can probably survive off of online orders. Either way, waiting 20 minutes for water isn't an Uber issue."
Bar Buca,3,2018-08-06,"Bar Buca was on my Bookmark list for brunch for a long time. Their egg skillet pictures impressed me. We didn't come sooner because my husband prefers a simple brunch menu which comes with eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, toast and salad. So, I had waited for a while until today.  

This afternoon I had trouble choosing which restaurant to have brunch at. We decided when it was 2 pm. Luckily, their brunch time is until 4 pm. So, we came to try out their eggs!  

FOOD (3.75/5)

- LA GRANDE COLAZIONE ($16). The dish comes with two hen's eggs, Italian sweet peppers salad (pepronata) and flatbread (tigella) . We saw the picture of the dish with FENNEL SAUSAGES on Yelp. It interested us and we both wanted to try it. However, I couldn't order the same dish as my husband did. I wanted to try something else also. I had a bite though (sigh). The sausage was small. It wasn't enough for two people lol. 

- UOVA CROCCANTI ($14). The dish came with three crispy duck eggs and topped with Buffalo Ricotta (cheese) and Pesto Genovese. The eggs and cheese were very flavourful. If you like cheese, you will love this. I'm not a big fan of buffalo ricotta. I like the taste but the smell was too strong for me. 

DRINK (4/5) 
We had Latte Macchiato ($3.95) and Americano ($2.90). Both were good. We love coffee. 

SERVICE (3/5)
I don't' really want o say that the service is mediocre. There are many reviews say that their services are great. Maybe it wasn't my day. My server was alright. She answered what I asked for but not really what I wanted. It was my first time and I wanted her to explain to us more about the menu and recommend us what the signature dishes are or what the most popular ones. We also don't know Italian! She said something. Short, and that was it! I could catch that those first few items on Salato section were salad and the half on the bottom were egg dishes, I guess. lol, I was disappointed! I was so excited at the beginning becuase I finally had a chance to come to try the brunch menu at Bar Buca. She just turned everything upside down. - -""

OVERALL (3.75/5)
The place was nice. The host was friendly. I love their eggs but I expect a bit more on their egg skillet and their service for the price. Would I come back again? I still want to try other dishes but I am concerned about their service.  We'll see!"
Lee Chen Asian Bistro,1,2019-07-19,"Thought this place would live to the rating but it fell flat, and flavorless. We ordered our food and it literally came in 2 minutes. (Yikes!)

Everything was bland and lacking sauce. Service was nice and welcoming, but the food was just subpar and overpriced. I'd save your money."
Dumpling House Restaurant,3,2019-09-14,"Service was as ok, dumplings are ok (depends) place is kinda gross. 

If you're not picky then this place might have good dumplings for you, just ignore the poor cleanliness of the place then you're good! The plates they use look old, and I question the cleanliness of the stuff they use. I saw a pile of serving plates near the front where they're cooking and I couldn't figure out if it was the dirty pile or the clean pile.

Service is prompt, I've been here a couple of times. My first time was with my s.o., who is white. We pretty much got ignored most of the time, the only time they attended to us was to ask for our order and to pay. 

The second time was with my Chinese friend, she spoke in Mandarin to them and I noticed they actually filled up my water a couple of times, I have no idea if it's cause I went with her.

Now for the dumplings, my friend said that the wrapper they used was too thick for her liking, and she said it made sense since they used dough. I didn't mind but the filling of the dumpling had a gross bitterness to it, and this comes from someone that willingly eats bitter melon. The pan fried one tasted better, but near the end we got sick from eating it cause of the oil, it pooled at the bottom.

The first time I went here, I only got steamed dumplings, I got the mushroom and spinach one and it was tasty. My boyfriend got steamed pork dumplings and he didn't complain, although he seldom does. I definitely think it's a must try but you can only pay in cash so make sure you bring some. If you're with TD, you might need to trek a bit if you want an ATM, otherwise CIBC, RBC and Scotiabank clients are good since the ATMs are in close proximity"
Taverna Mercatto,2,2019-12-19,"This is definitely Italian food for the after-work crowd, a Buca di Beppo-type of experience that didn't leave that much of an impression on my palate. It wasn't that the food was badly executed but rather that the plates were by-the-numbers unmemorable. I was here with the same dozen people I had been with for the previous eight hours, so small talk opportunities had already been exhausted as we sat closely together at a communal table. Because of the size of our party, I was able to try quite a number of their dishes and got a reasonably broad cross-section.

The common adjective connecting the plates was 'bland'. We started with the $14 Calamari Fritti which apparently came with shishito peppers that had disappeared by the time the plate was passed to me (photo: http://bit.ly/35MxgSg). Meh. I did manage to snag one of the overly chilled prawns on the $21 Shrimp Cocktail platter (photo: http://bit.ly/2EE5UBy). Better were the $13 Beets & Burrata with arugula and toasted almonds (photo: http://bit.ly/34Lnhva) and the $12 Greens which added celery hearts for crunch and a drizzle of sherry vinaigrette (photo: http://bit.ly/36TVmKG). The pasta plates were pretty standard issue given the couple of bites I was able to get of each.

The $21 Linguine di Mare was a typical seafood melange with little imagination (photo: http://bit.ly/2PGtJ22), while the $18 Tortiglioni alla Bolognese at least provided meatiness in the veal & pork ragu, but again it was bland and lacked freshness (photo: http://bit.ly/373WnjJ). The three different pizzas disappointed. The $18 Verdure had toppings and a basil pesto that were rather skimpy on the chewy crust (photo: http://bit.ly/38R3Y6R). while the $17 Margherita was just wet (photo: http://bit.ly/2Q1UXzi). Only the $19 Prosciutto was reasonably good with the padano cheese and prosciutto more plentiful (photo: http://bit.ly/34GULe2). 

Dessert came on cutting boards, and they offered a trio of which truthfully I only tried the Tiramisu Cake Roll which was OK (photo: http://bit.ly/2M8ukaH). There was also Chocolate Budino and Cannolo though my colleagues grabbed those pretty quickly (photo: http://bit.ly/36UM69j). My favorite part of the meal? The $14 Pimms Cup with ginger ale, lemon & cucumber, which honestly hit the spot far more than any of the food (photo: http://bit.ly/2SarzJH). Listen, none of us had high hopes for culinary delights here, and even our sponsor admitted this was not her first choice, but the proximity to our hotel just made it so convenient.

FOOD - 2.5 stars...standard issue Italian with few surprises
AMBIANCE - 2 stars...loud and rather packed after work
SERVICE - 2 stars...nothing special 
TOTAL - 2 stars...not worth seeking out unless your expense account covers it

RELATED - Traveling to Toronto? Here's a collection of places I've tried and reviewed: http://bit.ly/2LETSfV"
Dumpling House Restaurant,1,2019-08-18,"TERRIBLE AND EXTREMELY RUDE SERVICE! LEFT DISAPPOINTED WITH THE QUALITY OF FOOD. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO GO.

My parents and I came here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. We ordered Singaporean fried rice noodle and the 15 steamed chives, egg, and dry salty fish dumplings for $10.99.

1. Noodles came out first (really small portions) and then they gave us the bill. We were like what??? Where is our second dish? And they were confused. They then realized they forgot our dumplings.

2. Dumplings came and only 14 out of 15 showed up. We let it slide. 

3. Zero eggs and salty fish in the dumplings. ONLY CHIVES 

4. When my parents paid the bill, the waitress got angry at us and asked why we didn't tip ... but we did tip and it was underneath the bills. So we were like ""excuse me??? Did you even look to see?"" She flips it over and sees the tip and then changes her energy completely and starts saying thank you. This woman had the audacity to get angry at customers who she treated so poorly yet actually still tipped. Im actually speechless.

Additionally, if you're asian and you complain about the food they just get pissed right back at you. And they tell you your opinion doesn't matter cause the Caucasian people don't seem to mind. Terrible"
Wilbur Mexicana,5,2019-12-06,"Absolutely the most delicious and fresh Mexican food that is affordable and in a sit down place with great service. I could go on and on and on about how much I love Wilbur. This place ticks all the boxes for me. It's a lowkey place with great food but not too lowkey so you don't have to hold your food in your hand while eating on the sidewalk because they only have room for 2 inside. 

You order at the front and take a table number and they bring your food to you. I've tried their veggie burrito, veggie tacos, chips and salsa and chips and queso. I honestly think you can't go wrong here, everything I've had has been delicious. I would highly recommend their hot sauce bar, you have access to a large variety of hot sauces, and they're even ordered by level of spiciness. What I like to do is a pseudo hot ones challenge with the different hot sauces and tortilla chips. I'd also highly recommend exploring the salsa bar, the ghost pepper salsa is delicious!

The overall vibes of Wilbur makes it a cool place to hang out and its clear a lot of people feel this way because there's normally a line out the door to get in. I'll definitely be revisiting, this is one of my favourite spots in city."
Mariachi’s Restaurant,3,2017-12-09,"It's pretty good Mexican food, and the atmosphere is cute. I sometimes come here for lunch when I am at work. Service is friendly and the food is decent. I've ordered the tacos, nachos and the churros. Can't go wrong."
Trattoria Nervosa,3,2019-03-24,"This is a very cute restaurant in the heart of Yorkville on the corner of Yorkville Avenue. 

Like most of the reviewers, I went for the popular dish, Malafalde di Funghi. This pasta dish tasted as good as it looked. It's creamy and the pasta was al denté. 

We sat on the main floor, which was buzzing on Friday afternoon. Next time, I'd like to check out the rooftop patio when the weather is nicer. 

The price is mid to higher end, which I'm not crazy about. And after reading other people's reviews, the taste for other highlighted dishes seemed more conflicted (less consensus -except for the dish I got), so this wouldn't be a go-to spot for me. 

Atmosphere is on point. It's not stuffy like most of the restaurants in Yorkville. It feels homey.

The server we had was super busy, but he did what he needed to do. He was very on point with pouring our champagne and always made sure our glasses were filled. 

Overall, it was a pleasant experience."
Stelvio,3,2019-05-25,"First time at Stelvio- wasn't as good as I'd hoped. 

We ordered some fritti mozzarella bites and they were good- but definitely needed a dipping sauce. Or maybe I'm just too used to real mozzeralla sticks with marinara. 
I wouldn't recommend it.

I ordered the pasta special which was a gnocchi with truffle, meat, and porcini. When I first got it I was happy that it came with a lot of truffle, but when I got into it I felt like it had too much. It was definitely too much of a good thing. But it was $28 so I guess they wanted you to feel like you got bang for your buck. 

My bf ordered the tagliatelle ragu and it looked good, but he said the primary flavour was salt. When I tried it- I would have to agree. It was tomato and salt. Not complex at all. 

Also as an aside- I would say the pasta portions are relatively small for the price. You get this dish with a little bowl dent in the middle and your pasta portion is basically the size of a rice bowl. 

I'm happy I tried it but I probably wouldn't come back."
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine,3,2019-04-06,"I went for an early dinner and there was one other couple in the restaurant. It slowly picked up with large and noisey families. The good was good. Wontons were a bit greasy but fresh. Dumplings were great. Hate asking for red wine vinegar when I visit dim sum restaurants, as I did here, just leave a bottle on the table next to the soy sauce. Sticky rice was hot but lacked much flavour. No refills on soft drinks. Host was great, server was OK. Nicely decorated room"
Giulietta,3,2019-04-26,"This restaurant is now on the top 10 list for the best restaurants in Canada.  I came here before the list came out and I have to say I am extremely underwhelmed.  There are much better restaurants in Toronto that deserve to take its place on the list, and especially much better ITALIAN in Toronto.

I had the calamari to start which was fresh and came with some shishito peppers which was fun.  But I find nowadays calamari is pretty good at most places.  For the mains I had the ravioli (cello spinach, stracciatella, walnut pesto) which is not a dish that would bring me back to the restaurant again.  I found the walnut pesto to be overpowering and very gritty/thick, but to be fair I actually don't like walnut that much.  

The pizza I had was thin crust and just nothing amazing.  There is MUCH better pizza elsewhere all over Toronto.  I have NO idea how this restaurant made it to the top restaurant list in Canada and I will not be coming back again.  I am giving 3 stars because the service is FANtastic and the restaurant is beautiful."
Eataly,3,2020-01-08,"Overall a cool place to visit. I had no idea what this place was, until I heard all they hype about it. When I received a gift card for it, I finally decided to check it out. We went on a Sunday afternoon and as expected it was busy. Assuming that there was line ups for the first week it was opened, it wasn't too bad. 

To start off, space itself was modern and vibrant. It was nicely decorated and had a little of everything. There was a supermarket, which kind of wrapped around the whole 2nd floor. From hand made pastas, sauce, cheese and etcs., they had it all. Surrounding the market was a few take out and, dine in restaurants as well, as cafe's and dessert. They also seemed to have classes too! 

The dine in restaurants were of course busy and, there was a wait so we opt'ed out for the take out joints. For the pizza, there was a variety of them but sold out quick (but also seemed like they were made quickly). There was also a take out joint, right when you go up the escalators which, seemed to have a variety of dishes. The gelato was one of my favorite things there and, maybe the best in the city so that's worth giving it a try. The desserts and chocolate, also looked amazing!

Overall, it was a cool experience and, would visit again to try the restaurants and dessert out!"
Mariachi’s Restaurant,2,2018-06-29,"If you want to go for excellent customer service, go for it. Great people, great location. 

However, if you are going for the food. Skip this place and try something else. Food was mediocre, tasteless and expensive. I'm sorry but I wish I could go back in time and save myself $66."
Los Guaca-Moles,1,2018-05-31,"Ordered through Uber eats .. maybe going to restaurant better , not sure , but the food was really gross. Waste of 70 bucks .. threw most of it out and feel really gross and might vomit .. nasty 
0 stars"
DaiLo,4,2019-11-26,"We came here for a date night and was blown away by the service and the food. I walked in thinking it was just every Asian fusion tapas restaurant but was pleasantly surprised with each dish.

To keep things interesting, we had the tasting menu and had dishes that weren't on the menu like the Big Mac Bao - which was delicious and you know, tasted like a Big Mac with that sauce.

My favorites of the night were the Hakka Wontons, Ontario Pea Dumplings and oddly enough, the corn soup starter they gave us to kick off the meal. 

I was completely stuffed at the end until the manager came over and served us a White Rabbit Ice Cream in basically a bowl of chocolate goodness. I will actually come back just for that dessert if it was on the menu - I was mind blown.

The only thing I would change is that instead of ordering the Giggling Trout, get the Duck instead."
Blu Ristorante,1,2019-06-17,The food was just horrible. The food was bland and the servers told us to try dishes that did not taste well
Los Guaca-Moles,3,2018-06-06,"It was a good restaurant, the enchiladas were good. The ice cream and dessert were better. Decent prices and service was fast. Nothing stood out to make it great."
Mi Taco Taqueria,1,2019-08-28,"Unfortunate to see such a great and authentic place go down in quality after growth in business. 

I loved Mi Taco when it first opened, it has a real authentic feel to it, amazing flavours of everything. 

I went back today after a couple years out of the neighbourhood and was so excited to go back, I was happy to see how busy they were and they had renovated. 

Unfortunately the quality of taco took a MASSIVE hit. The corn tortilla was mush by the time my food came to me. No seasoning at all. What a disappointing experience and loss in Toronto's Taco scene."
Itacate,5,2018-12-01,"Bring cash. Have patience. Be hungry. Eat everything you can. 

You'll be hard pressed to find another place like this in Toronto. This is the best. The dishes here are an experience. You'll leave here, walk a block, and then want to return for more. 

To all the reviewers docking stars for this place being cash-only....really?!?"
Fusaro’s Kitchen,5,2019-04-06,"Neighbourhood gem. No joke. For those of you who are looking for fast, damn tasty pasta and pizza this is the place you need to come. It's all about the food. Nothing fancy, but good for friends to meet up, or even if you just need to grab a quick meal. A lot of options on the menu and everything is made fresh and delicious. The servers are friendly. There is also a take-out option. Don't need to twist my arm to return here!"
Hotopia Downtown,1,2019-09-25,Poor service. Extremely slow. You have to wait for 30 minutes to be sited and another 40 minutes for your food. Will not come back
Mexico Lindo,1,2017-10-05,"Worst service ever, was yelled at by the head cook when we asked if take out was available because he was too busy and its not worth his time for a small order. His words.  Avoid this place, much better options ""Mariachi"" on Yonge street 2 mins away.  Playa Cabana downtown."
Eataly,3,2020-02-20,"I went on a Wednesday night around 8pm and was surprised there still many people, however, the wait for a table is not long.  Staff are all very friendly and very informative as I was asking about what wine to drink and etc.  The place is bright and clean but the only thing was I think (at least that's what I believe) there was only one washrooms to share for the entire Eataly.  
Food: the kale salad is a must!  It was so tasty!  The pasta was cooked to my liking (i asked a little cooked over al denta) and pizza was ok.  Overall I would come if there is no long wait.  And I still need to try their desserts!"
Asian Legend,3,2018-08-29,"Went there with my husband on a Saturday night, and noticed that they don't have many tables for 2-4 people. So you basically have to wait until a table is available. They do have seats on 2 levels. 
The Chinese food was average, nothing special. It's a little bit over priced compared to the other Chinese restaurants that's in the area."
MEXITACO,2,2019-09-25,"This has been a regular lunch spot for me this past year though I won't be returning . 

Last visit lunch two other tables only 2 waiters .

Wine ordered was old and smelled like vinegar.

Ordered apps nachos with guacamole and beans .

Both bowls for dips were still wet and beans tasted like dish soap .

Ordered water with ice did not ever arrive . Taco was okay but not what it used to be .

Cheese in a taco being extra at a Mexican restaurant is wired to me as well .

I wish they kept the same service quality as when they opened . 

We won't be going back ."
Taverna Mercatto,3,2019-04-14,"Came for dinner on a Friday night with a girlfriend before a night out. Your typical downtown core restaurant. The vibe is casual because it's near the CN Tower, Skydome & ACC; everyone's in their game gear & it's really loud inside.

Service is fine, nothing really stood out to me - pretty standard job. It took a bit longer than I'd hoped for our food to come out, but it was kind of busy since the jays game was starting/ending. We were also really hungry while waiting, so it might've felt longer.

The food tasted pretty good! I got a seafood linguine, even though I don't normally like to work for my food but the mussels were awesome. I got an okay portion size - slightly lacking in noodles, but my friend got the egg yolk carbonara and it was actually so small, I felt bad. I don't really think it was worth the price of the dish because of the small sizes.

Overall, I probably wouldn't come back. There are better places to get pasta that might be just a bit farther of a walk."
La Marquesita,3,2019-05-18,"Food (3/5): decent. The corn chips were nice and crispy but the toppings were lacklustre in taste. There also wasn't enough sauce and cheese to cover the chips 

Price (2.5/5): a bit over priced for what you get 

Ambiance (3.5/5): quaint and cute decor, in a good location. No seating though!

Service (4/5): got this to go through ritual, the food was made fresh and there was only a very brief wait!"
El Charro,1,2019-12-29,"This place use to be good, but not anymore. The tacos tasted the same, hardly any chicken was found in my ""chicken burrito,"" and $11.95 + tax for a few SMALL pieces of calamari. I won't be returning."
Sichuan Garden Restaurant,3,2018-10-25,"TL;DR Delicious Chinese food but not exactly authentic Sichuan. 

We ordered takeout on a Saturday night - green beans with pork, gong bao chicken, and mapo tofu. 

The green beans with pork was a standout, the beans tasted fresh while nicely fried at the same time, the dish could have used slightly larger pork crumbs though. 

The gongbao chicken was definitely not authentic - it was a bit saucy compared to the normal version and the chicken pieces were larger than normal. It was not spicy at all and maybe a bit sweet. It was still tasty. 

The mapo tofu was also a standout - a bit spicy and very flavourful.
 The portions were large and generous. We can't comment on cleanliness or service since we ordered delivery via DoorDash. 

One star off since neither of us felt like it was authentic Sichuan cuisine - too much cornstarch and a tad too sweet. It was tasty nonetheless. Side note, we both had poor stomaches a few hours after dinner. Can't tell if it was from the meal, just figured we'd add in case."
La Carnita,5,2018-12-27,"AmaZing. Literally said wow every bite. This place gets buuuuuuusy and I can understand why. The atmosphere is very cool, kinda dark tho and loud but that's because of people around us. The food was amazing. I can't even make a recommendation because everything was so good. The only think I regretted ordering was the taco with fried chicken, the chicken was just too bite and oily. But the taco came with a peanut lime hot sauce that was to die for. Next time I would ask for grilled chicken on top of that taco order instead of fried. The steak taco was perfection. I wouldn't order more than 2 tacos... me and my friend has one small app (the shrimp), 2 tacos each and the churros and that was absolutely the perfect amount of food. 

Server wasn't really coming to us a lot but it was getting so packed by the time we ordered. 10/10 definitely want to go back."
La Marquesita,5,2019-02-18,"Hi, i went to eat lunch here today with my friends and i had a wonderful experience. The space is so clean and beautiful. The food is the best mexican food in toronto. So much variety in their menu. They also have their signature desert. The price is very good too.i am coning back only here for mexican food. The staff is so friendly and fast"
Swatow Restaurant,5,2019-10-21,"And still and absolute belter of a Chinese, the best beef in black bean sauce in the city!

I always intend to try something new but always end up with this and shrimp fried rice - great comfort food."
Hotopia Downtown,2,2019-11-01,"Not for everyone, maybe an acquired taste. Had the Sichuan pickled basa as per other reviews and the flavours were just too strong. It would be nice to have a smaller portion version so new customers could try a wider spread and not feel so locked in. The single large $30 slightly tongue numbing, gingery sour soup was too much of a commitment for two people. Good initial taste but then it just becomes overwhelming. Definitely need a lot of rice for this dish."
98 Aroma,1,2019-06-09,"Oh my God!! How did they get high ratings!!????? They had sectional sittings and some open areas. The place is dark for a Chinese restaurant. The decor is mostly wooden plaques and wood carvings. 

The servers or staff there were not friendly and talked behind your back. Yes, I understand Mandarin even though I spoke English to them!! I had to get up twice to get their attention and they only had three tables with customers. 

It's supposed to be fine dining so I had a feeling that the portion would be smaller. Ok. But why all the saltiness in your dishes!!! The veggie dish was pricey and decent. The shrimp fried rice lacked the shrimps. They were tiny!! The rice was hard. It felt more of a Caucasian dish. The beef and broccoli dish was the largest dish full of salt!! Basically eat and drink lots of water. 

I was obviously not satisfied or full. Dishes were TOO SALTY, even my friend didn't like them. 

Never will I go back!"
Fieramosca,2,2019-01-29,"I have one question: who are you people who gave this a 4 or 5 star rating??????
We visited for dinner on Saturday evening. When the server appeared to fill our water glasses using a plastic pitcher we knew it was a bad sign. Most disappointing dining experience. We made the reservation based on reviews. I'm simply shocked this restaurant has a 4.5 rating. The food attempts to be high end fine cuisine but is really just pretending. We had the caprese salad. The tomatoes were large (rock) hard basic garden tomatoes - served freezing cold. The mozzarella was rubbery, not creamy like a caprese salad should be. The arugula was a basic run-of-the-mill salad. Excessive and boring. I had the black cod special. The portion was huge and that was all it had going for it. The cod was served on a big bowl full of under cooked garden vegetables (carrots and cauliflower) with watery-tomato sauce. It was a dish you'd expect at a family restaurant chain. It wasn't served how black cod should be. My husband's excessive serving of orecchette was bland and served in a bowl of liquid. 

The only positive feedback we can share...the martinis were delicious and the server was lovely and friendly. 

It was a cold evening but the dining room was uncomfortably cold and the washrooms were FREEZING.  Yes, it was a very cold evening in the city but this is a restaurant - it should at least be warm. I understand the restaurant has been around for over 30 years - they've had plenty of time to figure out the heating. 

The dining room is old and tired, not in a charming way. There was paint peeling from the ceiling above us. We were seated at a table beside a shelf loaded with about 100 bottles of wine that hadn't been dusted in the restaurant's 30years. I've not seen a worse display of wine.

I loved that it was a family-owned restaurant - that's whey we went. It's low end and overpriced. This is not a Yorkville-grade restaurant. Save your money."
Hacienda las Américas,5,2018-08-26,Freaking delicious!!! We had the burritos al pastor and words really can't describe the feeling in my mouth. The rice was perfect and the meat was well marinated. I would highly recommend this place
Carisma,3,2019-07-04,"Not feeling it for the new fancy location.

Love the old location with old friendly staff than the new ones.  The price is more expensive, and the food is not as good.  The new staff didn't know about serving / dinner etiquette.  Serving both left and right side.  With the lower food quality and higher price tag / seemed more fancy environment will look for more.  The owner is still there and he has to work hard and busy himself by telling the new younger staff what needs to be done.

Really disappointing that the food was not as good as before (far from it)."
Terroni,3,2020-02-20,"The only reason I visited was because I had a gift card due to poor service from my previous visit. I'd say they redeemed themselves in terms of service for this visit. Our server was extremely friendly, helpful, and attentive. We were also seated in an area downstairs from the main dining area which made it feel more intimate and allowed the sever to check up on us more often. I came for Valentine's Day dinner and was still able to get a table for a group of 6 a week in advance. 

I ordered the gnocchi and it was alright. The pasta itself was cooked perfectly but the sauce was kind of basic. I've had better gnocchi elsewhere but for the price point here, I was expecting a bit more. I think some pasta may be more worth it than others on their menu. The homemade gelato was the highlight of my meal - super creamy and soft, great flavour, good portion. I had the hazelnut and pistachio and it was some of the best gelato I've ever had. 

Overall, I think you could find better or just as good food elsewhere, at the same price point. But worth a try if your an Italian food lover, even if just for the gelato."
Gusto 101,5,2019-09-15,"Go for the Gusto! Superb service, great ambiance and fantastic food. 
Planned a small surprise birthday dinner for my sister. She listed this as one of her favourite eateries in the city so I arrived early with balloons. 
The front entrance staff were very kind to allow me to get a table for four ...with balloons LOL. 
Wait staff were equally friendly and very fast. Service was excellent. 
Food: my sister highly enjoys their kale salad. I thought it was great - massaged kale shredded with some sort of lemon vinaigrette and topped with Parmesan shavings. 
I spied the pizzas making their way to the tables of others so I went with a  prosciutto and arugula option. It was delicious. Perfect combination of flavours with a light, crispy crust. 

Definitely recommend for a nice, light meal with friends. A little loud for a date night but groups seem to like it (there's a second level and a patio during the summer months)."
Chop Chop,4,2019-01-07,"I enjoyed a solo dinner here recently. The room is is tiny, but I grabbed a window seat. I had three dishes. The pan-fried dumplings were very good; fresh and expertly fried and lots of flavour, albeit very similar to what you can find elsewhere in Chinatown (see Mother's Dumplings and the Dumpling House for example). The green beans were truly outstanding; perfectly cooked and seasoned, and not too greasy. I could eat a plate of those beans for lunch every single day.

The only (small) misstep was the Taiwanese basil chicken. While hot and fresh, it was a little dry and didn't have much basil flavour.

I would definitely return."
Chop Chop,3,2018-12-10,"Let me first say that I was walking into this restaurant expecting to give this place a 4-star (if not 5-star review). I was skeptical of the reviews that rated this place under 4-stars because of raving reviews from co-workers of mine. However, that co-worker went to this place the Friday before I came and also deemed the quality has declined. So maybe it is worthwhile reading on my review as to why that's the case.

My friend and I ordered three things so i'll describe each item below- starting with the best.

1. Green beans- if all the other food was as good as this one, I would've given this place a 4-star review. Fresh, flavorful, and on-point. The wringly green beans stir-fried into the peppers and mushrooms were fantastic. However, this was a very small plate for it to cost $11. Quality: 4.5/5. Price for the food amount: 3/5.

2. Fried rice- this was their featured fried rice and a recommendation from the co-worker. I'm not a fried rice person to begin with but chose this because of the rec. This was just fried rice I could get at any chinese restaurant in chinatown for probably 75% of this cost. It was a lot but not memorable. Quality: 3.5/5. Price for the food amount: 4/5 

3. Boiled pork and chive dumplings- having chosen the healthier version of the dumpling options (versus fried), these turned out to be the most disappointing meal here. The dough/skin of the dumpling was very thick (and this is my greatest fear). The ratio of meat to skin was probably 1:2.5. Quality: 2/5. Price for the food amount: 3/5. You can get the same dumplings but WAYYYYYY better at dumpling house in Chinatown. Thank me later and go there.

So in conclusion, if you're looking for the hype of this place that came from BlogTO or other reviewers, this place will not meet your standards. I would go elsewhere for chinese food- specifically Chinatown; unless you want the aesthetics and hip vibe, then this place got that nailed down."
Trattoria Taverniti,1,2019-07-12,"Absolutely terrible food and even worse attitude and service. 

Didn't even have a bite of the food"
Lee Chen Asian Bistro,3,2019-04-01,"The interior here is spacious and clean, which makes it a good place for happy hour or business meals. The servers were quick, but it took some effort to get their attention sometimes. 

We had the dan dan noodles, pork belly over rice, XLB, and pan fried dumplings. Although this was a mix of appetizers and dimsum, the amount of food was just enough for us. My favorite was the dan dan noodles, especially with the hot chili oil for those that like spice. 

Overall I had a good dining experience but was a bit disappointed with the dimsum selection. I was looking for a good dimsum restaurant in Chinatown and, for being labeled a dimsum restaurant, there wasn't that much."
Fusaro’s Kitchen,4,2018-08-15,"The patio is a bit cramped, but thankfully the food makes up for it. I tried two of their chicken pastas and both were delicious! The pasta is cooked well, but the sauces were standouts! Plus, you get some bread to snack on while you wait. Service is a bit spotty though."
Taverna Mercatto,3,2019-08-13,"I'm still so full writing this review; which is usually a good sign!

The service was good all night, including the full glass of water my boyfriend knocked right off the table that was immediately cleaned up, so that aside:

We started with a bottle of wine, Priorat, which was delicious! About ($100), a great Spanish red, highly recommend.

First came out the calamari ($14) delicious but quite a small portion, more for one person than it was shareable.

I got the Carbonara (basic and $18), it wasn't at all spectacular, in fact it wasn't even memorable. And the portion was not that large either.
My boyfriend got the 8oz ($38) and the cook was perfect, while the star of the dish was the layered potato serving oh my 

Followed up with an Amaretto, and a tiramisu for me (creamy, flavourful, large, filling, delicious!!!) and a caramel something for my boyfriend (also creamy and delicious!)

Highly recommend dessert over everything else we had! It's a cozy place to go after work, but not that impressive really. I'd call a 3.5/5 an accurate rating! 

Pictures attached!!

Will I be back? Unlikely, maybe just for that tiramisu some time"
Enoteca Sociale,5,2019-04-06,Great place with such a cozy ambiance! We sat at the bar and enjoyed some of the best ribeye steak I ever had! My husband got the Caccio e Peppe! The ribeye was seasoned perfectly and the salad that came with us was perfect! I wish I was staying in Toronto long enough to eat here again!
Como En Casa,2,2018-03-27,"Two words can summarize my thoughts on the food here: overpriced and bland. I was super stoked to try Como En Casa because (1) I LOVE Mexican food and (2) fellow Yelpers have given this place such glowing reviews. We placed a takeout order on a Friday night. I ordered a small chicken burrito and my husband ordered a large verde burrito with beef. When I called and placed the order on the phone, the person asked me ""if guacamole was okay"". I said yes. To my chagrin, the guacamole was an extra charge, and we ended up paying nearly $30 for two burritos. I recognize that it's partly my fault for not checking if guacamole was extra, but I thought the way that I was asked suggested it was included, and they were asking if I wanted it on my burrito. Just seemed kind of slimy, if you ask me. 

All of this (including the high-ish price tag) would have been fine if I enjoyed my burrito. Negative. The meat was incredibly dry and bland. I barely had any chicken in my burrito, and if I did manage to snag some meat, it tasted like chewy old chicken. The burrito was mostly rice with, like, one piece of lettuce. I barely tasted a tomato or anything to break up the rice. I didn't notice any beans or sour cream. Honestly, this was a terrible burrito. I think I'm pretty easy to impress with Mexican food, but this was just horrible. My husband didn't like his either. I won't be wasting my precious Friday-night cheat meal on this place."
Artisan Plus,5,2020-01-22,"Amazing noodle shop!

Seating is a bit tight, so not the best winter spot with jackets, but there are some little storage spots found all around. Their decor, on the other had, is on point--and so is their food! I think pretty much anything here is a winner in my book. 

We got the wok cumin che mian, yopo biang biang mian, pork jia mo, spicy stewed beef noodle, and liang pi.
The wok cumin che mian is a nice spiced and savory side dish. It could realistically be considered a small meal if you ate it by itself. 
The yopo biang biang mian has a bit of everything. It has a sweet and savory taste and plenty of toppings for the noodles! I love how they really don't skimp out on the toppings, which likely consists of half the dish! Their noodles are also wonderfully springy. 
The pork jia mo was absolutely stuffed with filing and was delicious! Really great simple item if you're on the go. 
The spicy stewed beef noodle was very nice. The beef fell apart and the broth was savory. It's not a very stand-out dish at this place, as it closely resembles a lot of Chinese beef noodle soup offerings at restaurants--but it's tasty nonetheless. 
Their liang pi is very peanuty and not very spicy, despite what it looks like (at least in my opinion). It reminds me of Thai or Vietnamese style foods and is very refreshing! 

This is an absolutely amazing restaurant for super delicious noodle dishes and at a pretty fair price points, considering the location and quality! They have quite a variety of noodle dishes, so there's something for everyone. Would highly recommend coming here at least once!"
Nodo Restaurant,3,2018-06-24,"For such a charming looking restaurant with high ratings, I had big hopes for Nodo. I loved the decor and set up, which I describe as a rustic boho chic. However, the food fell short of expectations and did not taste very authentic at all. I ordered the tradition gnocchi recommend by our server, it was so so. My friend had better luck with the fish. We shared the tiramisu for dessert, but that was also underwhelming and we only ate a quarter of it. The portions are fairly large if that helps."
Ho Ho Barbeque,3,2019-10-26,"This place was ok. We tried the roasted duck, roasted pork, and bbq pork, and pork tongue. Taste was average. Duck was very hard to bite through. Meats were cut sloppily and some barely cut. Floor was sticky. With so many better options around, probably won't try again."
Sugo,5,2020-02-24,"Oh yes padre. I have been salivating over this place for for quite some time now and when I was able to finally visit I was glad to see I wasn't disappointed!

My friend and I went on a Friday night at 5pm and to our delight there was no line up! Their dining area is very small and they don't do reservations. It's decorated with red and white table linens and there's a simple chalk menu board above where the cashier is. This area is for takeout orders. We sat down and our waitress came by to give us some advice about her favs which helped.

We got mozzarella sticks to start which was served with their signature sugo. They were super tasty. We also got a caesar salad. It was very fresh and super garlicky, just the way I like it! My friend got the gnocchi that came with their signature sugo (sauce) and I got chicken parmigiana with spaghetti in sugo. They gave me 2 pieces of chicken, and the mountain of spaghetti was HUGE. I seriously had leftovers for 2 meals after that. 

The chicken parmigiana was magnificent, tender and flavourful. The spaghetti was cooked perfectly and sauce was deliziosa. I had some of my friend's gnocchi too and wish I got too because it was so tasty, light and fluffy little pillows of gnocchi heaven.

We got tiramisu afterwards to share for dessert. Honestly at this point I was surprised we were able to have anything else. The tiramisu was so good. A good portion and it was one of the best tiramisus I've ever had!

Can't wait to come back here for the other dishes!"
Dumpling House Restaurant,1,2019-12-06,"This was my second time dining at this establishment, but mark my words it is the last! While eating an order of noodles I was splitting with my gf I came across a COCKROACH!!!!!  

When I confronted the owner he looked down at my plate and saw the roach and quickly took my plate and dashed to the kitchen before I had a chance to take a photo.

The only funny and bewildering part to this is that a group of people standing behind me waiting to be seated saw what had happened and witnessed the roach in my noodles and still decided to stay and dine !!!!

FAIR WARNING TO ALL, DO NOT EAT HERE!!! COCKROACHES ARE ALSO DINING AMONG YOU!!!"
La Chilaca Taqueria,3,2018-11-24,"I came here to try out some tacos.  The tacos average in price about $5 each.  They have different sauces that you can put on your tacos.   I tried the pork tacos.  While it wasn't bad, it wasn't memorable either.  

This place is located inside and there are other businesses inside as well.  It was hot and stuffy.  The restaurant wasn't the cleanest either.  

Overall, it was just ok.  A bit cheaper than the more famous place across the street."
Ho Ho Barbeque,2,2020-04-10,"Ordered a whole roast duck. One of the worker says to me that he had to cut the duck inside the kitchen. While I came home and opened the take out boxes, one of the box was full but the other box was half full and there were a lot of ducks's necks to replace the empty space. I have assumed they stole some of the goods part of the duck for their combo rice meal and they make $$$ out of that. No wonder that they had to cut the duck inside the kitchen so that you can not see what they are stealing. I had call my friends and they say the same thing.  The duck was good and you can taste the freshness and was not frozen but you lost me as a customer for life. The reasons why I brought the roast duck from them at that time because the other two Chinese roast meat place in the same area was closed due to Covid 19 and they was the only place open for Chinese roast meat. Words of month travel very fast and your business will suffer because of this unethical practice.
Now I know how they are able to sell the rice combo meals so cheap.
Buyers Beware."
Jacobs & Co. Steakhouse,5,2020-02-15,"Great food and amazing service. Loved every bit of it. 
Patrick (our waiter) made the experience even better. 
Worth every penny!"
La Vecchia Ristorante,5,2018-01-22,"Finally made it over here, and I'm glad I did. Met with a friend, and made reservations for a weekday, as they still are rather busy. 

For drinks, I had the Sofia Loren I believe, and it was a nice drink to start, but just a little too sweet for my palette. We ordered a bottle of their pinot Nero, which I had never heard of before. It was so delicious! Not overly sweet or dry, and chilled to perfection. I find red wine can make me feel very sleepy if I'm having it with a larger meal. 

We ordered the antipasto to start. I did enjoy what I had, but maybe would have preferred more cheese and meat than vegetables. 

For my main, I had the ravioli which was fantastic! It wasn't like 4 tiny pieces that you get at other places. This was a very filling dish that wasn't heavy, and full of flavour. I also am a sucker for truffles. My friend got the veal special and loved it. 

Now I would have given this place a 4, but the service was amazing! Raf was our waitress and was cracking jokes with us all night. She came with me downstairs to the bathroom as I am on crutches and offered to help me inside. She honestly made the experience memorable, and I hope the restaurant does read this, as she deserves a lot of credit."
La Chilaca Taqueria,4,2018-10-07,"Affordable tacos with well sized portions. What else can you ask for ?

La chilaca taqueria is small taco shop serving delicious morsels for a great price!  Selling 3-5$ tacos and certain specials (like 10$ for 4 pastor tacos). 

I ordered the carne, pastor, carnitas, pollo, and fish. I only wish I didn't get full so fast because I wanted more. Probably the closest thing I've tasted to tacos on the street in Mexico. 

Would highly recommend the fish ( very fresh and light) and the pastor (if you're a fan of pineapples) and if not go for the pork."
Ramen Isshin,5,2020-01-06,"Cozy Ramen place with excellent service! Loved the spicy miso Ramen - I liked how the Ramen was loaded with sprouts, gave it a different feel altogether! Pork was amazing and juicy! I also tried their sake cocktail- I am a sake lover now! 
Definitely visiting again !"
Ramen Isshin,3,2020-02-08,"Black Sesame Tan Tan:
Nice chewiness of the noodles, and it was very filling despite looking like a small portion. The fun part about this dish is you grind the black sesame and add it to your bowl as you desire! The black sesame added a very fragrant taste. This was a nice experience, however it was too salty for me (apparently a lot of things I eat are too salty for me though??? Something must be wrong with my taste buds). I tried my friends white sesame noodles and that was less salty, and the broth was more light and creamy. I would probably get that instead next time. Glad to finally be able to cross Ramen Isshin off my list"
Yummy Yummy Dumplings,1,2018-09-30,"I was craving soup dumplings and this restaurant has such good reviews that I just had to come here. It's a tiny restaurant down some steps, so it might be hard at first to find if you don't know what you're looking for exactly. There isn't a ton of seats, so if it's busy, you might need to wait for a table.

The restaurant itself could use a huge facelift. The washrooms were dirty and very small. The whole place just feels outdated - minus the tables and chairs. I came on a busy Saturday night but was seated fairly quickly. They cleaned my table before I was seated but the dish cloth they used to wipe the table was definitely used.. my table just smelled like a used dish cloth, sadly.
There were also a TON of mosquitos. We were seated right in front the of door, so perhaps this could be why.. but the most odd thing is that they would just drop onto our table and food, and almost die or stop moving instantly. Not sure what was going on.. but it ruined my appetite. 

ONTO THE FOOD: the most important reason why I'm reviewing! We ordered the Juicy Pork Dumplings (soup dumplings), fried shrimp & pork dumplings, & chive pancakes. The soup dumplings were just okay. The filling wasn't as flavourful as other ones that I've tried from other places. It was missing something but I can't figure out what it is. The pancakes were really good, and I wish I ate more but they were dripping I grease, so I couldn't eat more than 2. I didn't have any of the fried dumplings but my boyfriend said they were very greasy as well. We actually had to go get a drink from a bar close by just to get rid of the greasy feel in our mouths.

I honestly wouldn't come back here myself. A lot of other people gave this place high reviews so I'm not sure if I just had a bad experience or not. But the greasy food and mosquitos flying around or dropped dead in front of us wasn't acceptable."
Blu Ristorante,5,2019-04-27,"The food was sooooo amazing! And the service was extremely good! I went there with my friend, and we both were extremely satisfied!"
Swatow Restaurant,3,2019-11-24,"Clearly this place is very popular because there was a line out the door during prime time dinner. This disappointing part is the table set up. It's so packed. We couldn't get to our table without telling like two tables if they can move. In addition, we were very confused about the food options. We had to send our noodles back because it's not what we wanted. I asked to double check before that could happen  but I guess there was a miscommunication. Also i was not a fan of the chicken we ate. Tasted mainly like a lot of fat and breading. The second  pair of noodles we got were very delicious.
Overall I'm not the biggest fan of the service and the food. Except the Lo MEIN, those were good
Menu:
General Tao Chicken
Lo Mein Beef and Vegetables"
Donatello Restaurant,3,2019-08-17,Food was mediocre at best I'm sad to say. The pastas and salads were very generic and like I can make that myself at home. Bread was warm which was nice and the atmosphere of both the outside downstairs/upstairs patios and the interior was nice.
Mexico Lindo,5,2020-03-15,"I heard about this place and have been putting off trying it. Then I watched Ugly Delicious S1 S2 and HAD to have tacos! Dropped in and ordered 5 al pastor tacos to go and boy, I was not disappointed! Reminded me of being back in Mexico eating street tacos! So delicious! Highly recommended! Couldn't stop eating long enough to take pics lol! I'll be back!"
Carisma,5,2019-08-06,"Fine Italian dining. Valued accordingly, but you certainly get what you pay for and the service was fantastic (as was the food). At our table the wild boar ragu pasta, sea bass and risotto were favourites. Our selections of Osso buco and delicate fish fillets perfectly prepared and flavored. The restaurant filled up as show time approached but we hardly noticed - not overly noisy despite being full by the time we departed. The food and service were both exceptional. Carisam is our number one choice for Italian food in Toronto. Sophisticated, elegant and classic. Love this place!"
Blooming Orchid,5,2018-11-11,"This is the best sushi place I have ever tried in my whole life. The dragon on fire sushi was very tasty and full of ingredients, the wonton soup is the best for hangovers, edamame comes salty, the deep fried cheese wonton was so good me and boyfriend finished the whole portion in less than 5 minutes, the green dragon roll came with fresh avocado and a delicious taste, the shrimp tempura lunch was crispy, and the miso soup was a little bit simple but it has several pieces of tofu inside and It might be just personal taste. All the portions were big, and for the prices the food is amazing. It's definitely a great place if you want to eat great food for a fair price. It's better if you call them to order cause they don't charge for delivery if the bill is more than 25 dollars, and they currently have a 10 % off discount because of their grand opening. Again, completely amazing I assure you it is worth it."
Itacate,2,2019-10-19,"This is a tough one! As some of you may know I love Tacos! I kept hearing that Itacate was the best place to grab the most authentic tacos in Toronto and obviously I had to give it a try. This little spot is located on St.Claire W and it doubles as a Butcher shop. I walk in and it smells amazing! I love pork tacos and since I can cook all other tacos I decided to get the Carnitas and El pastor. I was so excited and 2 of the saddest looking tacos were brought over. 

Now, looks are not everything so I decided to take a bite. Even though the tacos were super plain I figured if the meat is super flavourful I won't need any sauces. The meats were very chewy, at one point I felt like I was eating leather. Most of the Pork had gooey fat all over it and I just wasn't a fan. I added cilantro, onions and the extra spicy sauce which helped with flavour but the meat was a big issue for me. 

Keep Eating,
Angela"
Chula Taberna Mexicana,3,2020-01-31,"I forgot, the second time I went, how bad the green curry is and got it again.  Damn it."
Tacos El Asador,2,2020-06-02,"The service was amazing, the guy that greeted us especially was very enthusiastic. But .. when it came from the food. it was definitely 1/5. No flavour , no seasoning no nothing. We ordered 6 Tacos, Guac and chips and cheese Pupusas . To begin with the tacos lets just say we didn't eat them all. The shrimp tasted too.. fishy? not enough toppings on the taco. The beef was blend and so was the chicken. Only good thing about our order was the guac and chips. I normally go to taco Gus at Kensington (highly recommend ) and I regret trying something new."
Bang Bang Ice Cream and Bakery,3,2020-01-22,"Sort of an overhyped ice cream shop.

They indeed offer unique flavours, but it's significantly more expensive than necessary. Their flavours are fun to try if you haven't been here, but I would probably never return with their exuberant prices. Two tiny scoops of ice cream can run you nearly $10. You can find plenty of ice cream shops with unique flavours for way less.
Their ice cream is also super melty as well. As soon as I got it, it was already melting all over the place. If you're into soft serve, this is your spot--but I'm a hard serve ice cream kind of person."
Ho Ho Barbeque,3,2020-01-27,"The barbecue meat here is really good, juicy and tender. I normally get the lunch boxes here, and it's very hit and miss here.
I made the mistake of coming here 1.5 hours before they closed. They ran out of veggies, but still had plenty of meat left.

If you get the young dude cutting your meat, you're gonna get much less meat in your box. he's pretty stingy. and I've gone here 3 times, and every time he cut my meat, I got either bad cuts, or very little.

I've gotten roasted duck rice before, and he gives you the bones and rib area, with one piece of breast so you have one piece with meat.

Today I got 2 boxes, No veggies were left. I got 6 pieces of bbq pork and 5 pieces of roasted pork. and whole box load of rice. was so disappointed! barely any toppings, and they had plenty of meat left!! not like they were running out.

argh! the only part I can't complain is it's 6.50 a box and comes with either soup or a can of pop.

Pro tip, come early, otherwise don't come. and hope it's not the young dude cutting your meat."
Juicy Dumpling,3,2020-01-10,"It's an interesting concept to see for fast food dumplings. It wasn't bad nor was it really good, but it was perfectly fine for a quick grab and go lunch. 

They all look so delicious, but when it came out, it was clear that it was either made hours before and reheated or just has been sitting out for a while..none of our dumplings were piping hot, and neither was the Soup inside the soup dumplings, which was a bummer. 

The fried chicken was hot and good, but we also ordered the mini sesame balls that tasted a bit like there was some chemical in there and it wasn't fully cooked through-- super gross."
Homemade Ramen,3,2018-09-11,"Noodles are what they do best, and that's what brought me back to this restaurant for the second time. It's a budget friendly spot to grab a bite in Chinatown. I really like the texture of the noodles here,  just a bit of chew, but still soft and lots of fun to eat. Everything else that goes with the noodles however doesn't quite stand out. Don't get me wrong, it's still delicious; an unhealthier version of what my mom would make. Maybe I've been spoiled by my moms cooking :p

The stir fried noodles are drowning in oil, and lots of msg used to add flavor to those cold dishes. It's hard to not like it, but so much regrets after. The portions are big but somehow I managed to clean the plate. As I wipe at my oil covered mouth from slurping the stir fried noodle, slowly realizing what I've done, my first instinct is that I should go on a juice cleanse tomorrow. However, as soon as I stepped out of the shop, I'm back to my normal self, thought of juice cleanse replaced by ""what should I have for dinner?"""
Buca,1,2019-05-22,"We came here (King St location) Tuesday evening to take our guests from Vancouver to a nice dinner. Buca has been my favorite Italian spots in Toronto and has been my top recommendation for good restaurants in the city. We never once had a negative experience at Buca until last night. It was very disappointing to be in such a classy restaurant only to be treated poorly by their servers. We ordered charcuterie and pasta amongst the 5 of us. As we finished our dinner, we had told our server to pack up my bigoli pasta. As I picked up my takeout box, I realized it was not what I ordered. I quickly told the server that this was not mine and to my surprise, she yelled ""f*** off"" and stormed off in the kitchen. We were in shock as to why she responded this way. She returned shortly after, visibly disgruntled, and told me to stay put while the manager comes to talk to me. The manager arrives and simply tells me to wait while they make a new one for me to take home. She was not apologetic at all. Mind you, we had to wait 30 minutes for them to make the pasta again and as soon as I received it, they did not even acknowledge the fact that it shouldn't have taken that long. 

Mistakes happen but under no circumstances should servers be swearing at their customers. We are extremely confused as to what led to such aggresive remarks when we were the ones who had to wait 30 minutes to get our takeout. Definitely not going back after this incident. Servers were rude and ruined our evening."
Grazie Ristorante,3,2019-12-14,"This restaurant was fantastic dealing with some menu modifications that allergies required. Usually there is pushback from the kitchen but not this place. For that we are grateful. 

The modified meal was good, well cooked and an ok all round meal. The pasta in both meals was properly cooked and fresh. The veal however, not as good. It had large sections of charred burnt meat and was quite dry. 

Overall, the service was great, food...mediocre."
La Carnita,3,2019-07-25,"Came here for the first time by luck, on a Tuesday- had to take advantage of their Taco Tuesday special ($28 for 8 hardshell tacos). 

The service here was friendly but a little slower than normal standards. It is also pretty stuffy inside on a hot day, especially on the top floor, but the restaurant itself is a cute, grungy setup. 

I shared the special with my friend, and it came with the perfect amount of toppings to fill the tacos... it's always so satisfying when you're giving the perfect food ratios. The tacos are presented on a tray along with the (""sides"" is what they call it but I think a better word for it is just the taco stuffings). It came with all your taco essentials, including guac. The ground beef also had a bit of a spicy kick to it, and the taco shells had a different crunch to them. Overall, nothing was mind blowing about the tacos. I think it's fun for when you're coming in a pair with someone else, but you'd need to order more with it to fully fill up an empty stomach (good thing my friend and I had a snack before coming). The tacos were presented nicely but if I were to get this for say, takeout, not sure the deal is worth hyping about. 

I'd be open to coming back to try more of their extravagant tacos though :) judging from their menu the prices seemed reasonable for a downtown restaurant."
Giulietta,4,2019-04-19,"This restaurant was recently voted as one of the top restaurants in Canada for 2019 - they are actually number 9 on the list. Anyone who knows me, knows how much I love Italian food, so I was really excited to try this place out. 

There were 7 of us at the table, and we discussed the possibility of having the family style meal, which is usually recommended for a party of our size. However, it wasn't easy getting everyone to agree on which dishes to try, so we all ended up ordering our own dishes. A couple of us did share a few bites, so I was able to taste a few more dishes than what I ordered for myself. This is always my favourite way to dine, so you can experience as much of the menu as possible. 

Our server did say that the menu changes with the seasons, which is great since you get the freshest ingredients at their peak. It can also mean that a favourite dish won't always be available, but it's great to try new things. 

I started out with a Negroni cocktail, which was probably the best one I've ever had. Kudos to the bartender, as it was perfection. For a starter, I had the grilled octopus - I was actually hoping it was available as an entrée, as I'd seen photos of it already. Sadly for me, it was just appetizer size. It wasn't as tender as I'd hoped, but it was really flavorful and well-seasoned. For my entrée, I had the branzino, which was served whole. It was difficult to eat because there were so many bones, and it tasted a bit overdone, but still enjoyable. I shared some of my fish with a fellow diner in exchange for a few pieces of his pork chop, which was exceptional. We also shared a side of asparagus as well as the cauliflower, the latter being a bit bland. Their namesake pizza was a big hit, with lots of pistachios and a hint of smoked cheese. 

Four of us ordered desserts, which we shared with each other, and I have to say that the lemon crostata that I ordered was very good, but the Italian custard, called Bonet PIemontese, was the standout for everyone. It's very much like a crème caramel in both appearance and texture. I would definitely order this again. Their coffee was also exceptional, although we did not get it until after we'd all finished our desserts. They really need to improve the timing on that, as most people prefer to have their coffee with their dessert. 

Service was generally quite good, although we did wait quite a while to order our food, and then again had about a 35 minute wait between the appetizers and the entrées. When they brought the bill, they advised us that they were unable to split by seat. This is usually an awkward situation, but it was made even worse by the fact that many of the items on the bill were listed in Italian, so some people were unsure of what they had ordered. It took about 25 minutes just to sort it out. I cannot understand with technology today, why the restaurant cannot split a bill. Their POS system was one of the newest and fanciest ones I've ever seen, so I'm not sure if I believe they can't do it, rather than they choose not to. 

In any case, the food was definitely good enough that I want to return, next time to try the pasta, as not one person in the group ordered any on this visit."
Dumpling House Restaurant,3,2019-09-01,"CASH only. There's a bunch of banks/ATMS around the area so you're good just in case. Service is less to be desired but the dumplings were pretty solid. If it's your first time, I recommend trying 3 different flavours first for $12-13 (additional $2) instead of committing 12 dumplings to one flavour. They've got steamed and pan-fried. We really like the pork and shrimp - the only juicy and flavourful dumpling. The classic pork and chive were quite dry and the spinach needed salt to save its integrity. Tried their beef noodles and was super garlicky and the noodles were broken up which was annoying to eat.

Overall, will I be back, probably not - considering there are so many other dumpling spots in the area that will probably have better dumplings and better service."
Blooming Orchid,5,2019-05-29,"Run don't walk! 

Blooming Orchid really lives up to the hype. 

I was looking for a new AYCE midtown and found one thanks to Yelp and other reviews!

I will post pics below, the food was fresh, portions were perfect, and the taste was excellent.

The service from Qing nan was flawless, her kind, sweet, and helpful disposition made it an absolute pleasure to dine here during lunch hour. She was working the floor, taking care of all the tables, preparing the deliveries, and taking payment for take-out orders, and still her service was great, jus

They have been open for 7 months now, and they definitely have the right combo, of staff, food, and atmosphere to be around for a long time to come.

The decor was simple, relaxing, and comfortable. The washroom was immaculate and again simply decorated closed off by a frosted swinging glass door to access the area.

Will definitely be back, looking forward to it! 
Did I mention lunch buffet was $15.00 Mon-Thurs"
MEXITACO,3,2019-02-11,"A few points:

We got:

-grilled fish tacos 
-bean/cheese quesadilla 
-chicken quesadilla 
-beef tacos
-beef burrito 
-fried plantain 
-churro
-4 beers/$10 Sunday deal

3 stars because the portions are on the small side for what you pay. One hungry person will need at least two orders of tacos plus a side to fill them up. Service was ok but seemed a bit disinterested. 

The churro was very very good. I recommend for desert. That was probably the dish that stood out the most. 

The venue itself is nicely designed and a cool hangout spot. I'm happy to have a place like this in the neighbourhood especially because there are not a ton of sit down Mexican restaurants in the east end. They definitely fill a niche. Food is fine but nothing to write home about. Worth a try but it won't knock you off your feet. You will be annoyed by the lack of parking but not much one can do about that."
Playa Cabana,3,2018-09-07,"My friend and I decided on Mexican food for dinner and this popped up as nearby where we were at the time, Yorkville/Annex area. As we walked in, immediately we're greeted and seated in a tight space for 2. The menu was explained to us and water was given, then we were left for a few minutes to decide. 

We decided on salsa fresca & chips, chicken enchiladas suizas and short rib emmoladas along with a bottle each of corona and negra cervezas.

Salsa fresca and chips arrived first, the tomato salsa was delicious, the morita chile seemed to have been grilled before it was mashed together with tomatoes and red onions and went well with the crispy chips. (If you come for anything at all, this would be it and definitely skip the guac as it didn't seem appetizing.)

My friend and I shared the chicken enchiladas suizas and short rib emmoladas, while tasty, I could've gotten it somewhere else for cheaper. 

Because of how tight the space is, I was able to look around at what the other dinners ordered and the the tacos seemed to be more popular, so will have to come back and try those.

We also ordered alfajores, which at $8 for 2 was just meh."
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3,2020-02-21,"It was alright. Went in here for lunch service and ordered the Khao soi.  I knew all the hype surrounding this restaurant. 

To be honest I don't understand why they are awarded with such accolades I stayed in Thailand for a month so I will use that for comparison. 

I find the Khao soi too rich and coconutty. It over takes the subtle nuances of a balanced dish. It just taste like coconut cream soup. I wouldn't make this the quintessential place for Thai food. Support other local businesses."
Miku,2,2020-04-24,Ordered the salmon lover and red tuna maki through Ubereats and unfortunately got food poisoning from my order.
Juicy Dumpling,5,2020-02-10,"I think I have found a favorite place for food if you're on a budget, and also as a student! Located around Dragon City Mall at Chinatown, this is a popular quick eats place for delicious soup dumplings as low as $2.99 for 6! There are limited seats inside, and by the window, however since it's a quick meal, people tend to leave pretty quickly. Their menu offers a variety of soup dumplings, rice and also juicy fried buns. One thing I don't usually see in other Shanghai restaurant is pan fried versions of soup dumplings, so I definitely had to make an order of that. After ordering with the cashier, you will get a beeper that will ring when youre order's ready.

The food came fairly quickly after ordering. The soup dumplings are what youd get at regular Shanghai restaurants; super juicy and tasty!! I was honestly so surprised how delicious they were as I was skeptical at first due to the low price. The fried juicy buns were a bit small compared to other places, but for the price, you cant complain, and plus they were also very juicy inside as well. The pan fried soup dumplings were also surprisingly juicy as well as I was worried the heat from pan frying them would take it away. All in all, we ordered 4 things and the bill came up to be $16!"
Miku,5,2020-02-23,"We have been meaning to try Miku. We somehow waited until Winterlicious, we were able to try a lot of items from the menu. 

The presentation and quality of the food was just great. On top of the winterlicious, we got a miso soup each and an extra plate of sashimi. 

Dan from Japan, took care of us that dinner. He is wonderful! Super funny and cheerful, Dan really made our night. Shout out to Dan!"
House of Gourmet,3,2019-06-26,"Fairly average Chinese food but open late until 2:00 am with lots of seating. They are located a block or so from from Spadina on Dundas.

Their food seems pretty average to me except for their char siu (BBQ Pork) on rice that is my favorite. Everything else is ok but with the exception of great wok hei. If you're looking for a quick bite after a night out this place will do since they open until 2:00 am and has plenty of seating. Their menu is fairly intense about 500 items and with plenty of seating for a big group. 

The food comes out super fast piping hot. Service is ok just need to keep flagging someone down, their table turn over is quick that is the way they operate so don't expect stellar service but they aren't horrible either."
House of Gourmet,3,2019-09-23,"I came to House of Gourmet looking for a quick lunch break from work. 

It's been quite a while since I had some noodles in soup so I decided upon going to a place I've known since childhood. Upon entering, I was seated immediately and I ordered a bowl of Beef Brisket Rice Noodle Soup. 

The broth was exactly how I remembered from my youth. Layers of flavour, while still retaining its heat. The rice noodles were cooked to a decent al dente, however the beef brisket was a bit disappointing. It was not tender and took quite a while for me to chew. I did wish they cooked down the brisket a lot more as any good beef noodle soup does require soft and tender beef brisket. 

The service is what you would expect at any quick service Chinese restaurant. You go there, order quickly, eat and get out. 

It's a great place for a quick bite from their wide extensive menu, especially if you're looking for a homestyle meal after the bar/club. This place has lot a bit of its mystique from its hey day but it is still one of Chinatown's prime spots for Cantonese food."
KINKA IZAKAYA ORIGINAL,3,2020-02-08,"For a party of 3, we ordered 3 set meals and 2 drinks, and we left with our stomachs pretty full. This is my 3rd time at this location, but unfortunately stars were docked off for quite an uncomfortable experience. 

Made a reservation for a party of 3 for 6:30pm on a Tuesday, what we were given was a small table for 2 with a small stool at the side of our table, with my back to the adjacent customers table at a corner, which essentially felt like I was in the middle of the walkway. Throughout the entire dinner, I had felt extremely awkward and uncomfortable as I had felt the waiters/waitresses' bodies touching mine every time they came by to serve food to the table behind me. We've requested 2 times, when the restaurant was not packed for a larger table, but nothing was to be done. Unsurprisingly, I felt like we were being rushed in finishing our plates one right after the other as there were no room at all to fit any dishes anymore. 

If we had proper seating and space, I believe the experience would have been that much greater."
GB Hand-pulled Noodles,4,2019-10-08,"Decided to try this place since we've heard so many good things about it, and to see if its up there on my list of best beef noodle soups in Toronto. 

We ended up getting the mega beef noodle soup because it seemed like the best thing to share between two people. But honestly, if you were hungry enough you could probably finish it on your own. 

Noodles are hand pulled in store, and you can choose the lenght/thickness or style you wanted your noodles to be. We opted for the round thin noodles. The broth is nice and light but it still has body. You can really taste the beefiness. The parsley and green onion help cut through the rich soup. One of my favourite things here actually was not part of the noodle itself. But rather it was the chilli oil. The chilli oil was delicious and I probably finished half of the container by myself. 

Honestly overall it was pretty good, but it didn't blow my mind. Solid beef noodle soup and awesome hand pulled noodles. 10/10 would come again."
Fusaro’s Kitchen,2,2018-12-16,"The best thing about this place is the price of the food. Me and my wife went for dinner about an hour and a half before thier closing time on a Saturday night the place was less than half full. We were seated at a table that felt like it was a common walk way by the front door so requested if we could be moved and the waitress refused to move us saying she couldn't offer up a four person table to two people, even though there were plenty and the place wasn't even half full. 

On to the food: 
Bruschetta: bread used was good nice and toasted not overly hard. The tomatoes were tasteless and bland which ruins this dish no matter how good the bread is. Did not taste like bruschetta at all.

My wife ordered the rigatoni Bolognese with a rose sauce. She did not enjoy it at all saying it was watered down sauce with chunks of bland tomatoes. 

I had the penne ala vodka with meatballs as a sub for the bacon my dish was not bad  food came out piping hot, sauce was decent meatballs were small and tasteless.

If you're on a budget, don't care about good service or food quality then this is the spot for you!"
Hotopia Downtown,3,2020-02-23,"Dining here on a Saturday night was a 30 mins wait on the waitlist for a group of four. There was a small waiting area so it wasn't terrible but heads up, the place is pretty noisy

We ordered the ""boiled clams"", the ""Sichuan Picked Flavoured Beef in soup"", and their iced plum green tea

The clams were def a hit and a very reasonable price ($8) we really enjoyed the flavour and quality of the dish

The beef soup sadly was a ""miss"", the beef shavings were decent quality but the taste wasn't enjoyable. Too many peppercorns were left in the dish and slightly tasted off ( I'm unsure if stale or...) 

Tbh the spice level is manageable and not over the top, I just found the flavour to be subpar for Sichuan soup dishes 

The plum green tea isn't a fave either, extremely sweet and diluted (tastes like a watered down freezie )"
Xola Mexican Food,2,2017-02-24,"Xola Mexican Food would be a great cosy place to take a first date. They promise Mexican food unlike any other. The small setting is endearing. While the service was excellent, and the menu promised good, fresh ingredients...

No salsa or chips to get you started on the house as is usual in the places I've been. Instead, for $10.50 or so, when we ordered the Guacamole as an appetizer, it was excellent and enough for both of us. As good as avocados can be. Not special.

I ordered the Duck. I received a very small serving roast duck taken off the bone in a small bowl, several small wraps, a  1/2 ramekin of chopped fruit for the wrap, a  1/2 ramekin of sour cream. That's it. No potatoes. No rice. No salad. Messy.  It was OK. Not interesting. Cost over $22.00.

My girlfriend ordered braised Lamb. Same thing. It was a tiny portion, stewed and served in a small bowl, with several small wraps,  1/2 ramekin of black beans. That's it. No potatoes. No rice. No salad. It was just OK. The duck was better. Cost over $18.00.

Add 1 beer and 1 excellent Margarita to that, and the bill was $80. 

Because the service was good, a tip had to be added which brought it up to $90.

Moral to this story - Xola is not even close to worth it. You won't find what you're used to or expect to. If you're open to novelty, you'll be disappointed by what you're served and what you're not.

For the best mexican, its worth the trip to Cielito Lindo in Pickering or Mexican Lindo at 971 O'Connor Dr, Toronto  - the very best. And we could have eaten twice for what I paid.

If you want duck or lamb, better to hit Chinatown or Greek Town respectively."
Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant,5,2019-12-30,"I've been wanting to come here for many years and finally got the chance to this week. Expectations were sky-high and all I can say is that this place delivered! The lobster made HK-style was one of the best dishes I've had this year. Amazing! The soup, fried rice, and snow peas were good but nothing compared to the lobster. For two of us, we got the 6 lbs lobster package that was ~130 CAD before tax and tip. HK-style was $15 but it was worth it. The lobster came on top a bed of delicious French fries."
Cinco Mexican Restaurant,5,2018-08-24,"It's tough for me to give out five stars but this place is just so great and to top it off (and earn the 5th star) is good value. The flavour in the meat is amazing. Our group had cochinita pibil, beef & carnitas, and fish. Everyone was super happy. Their salsas, a key measure of any Mexican restaurant, are great. 

Best tacos I've had in Toronto, one of the best spots on Roncesvalles. Can't wait to return. It'll be a Ronny staple for our family."
Mexico Lindo,2,2017-10-25,"The decor is nice and the atmosphere feels right, but this place lacked a bit of service attention. 

We dropped by for a quick bite as we love Mexican food. We ended up ordering the fajitas for two. It was a large portion of meat (we got chicken and chorizo mix) but there were only 5 (five) tiny tortillas... that didn't make sense to me. 2 or us, lots of meat, but very few tortillas...we asked and we had to pay to get more, which I thought was not reasonable. I didn't get more cause I'm cheap. Also, we got a tiny container of sour cream. 

Overall it felt like they offered very little in terms of condiments. 
I waited a good 5-10 minutes to get more napkins and some hot sauce (Something good and spicy) but no luck. I ended up getting up and walking to the front to ask for it. Overall the service wasn't great. 
The fajitas were good but nothing out of this world. The selection of Mexican beers was also limited. 
We will have to keep looking for the ultimate Mexican Food place!"
Terroni,2,2019-10-20,"This restaurant is really for the experience. With such a lovely ambience and outstanding service from all staff, the food did not meet up to par with what you may expect.

For starters the food is on the higher price end, and smaller quantities. Although, it is all homemade pasta!! 

I've had homemade pasta before so I had high standards walking in.. I was so excited to try the Gnocchi because well, I LOVE Gnocchi. 

However, I was disappointed. The pasta itself was quite soft and seemed soggy with the red sauce altogether. There was no 'bite' to it, more of a 'mush'. I did not enjoy my meal and that left a significant impression on my take of what the rest of the entrees may be like. 

Note: Calamari & Earl Grey tea were delicious!"
DaiLo,3,2019-11-23,"Very pricey very small portions but good atmosphere, services is pretentious but ok. Good place for drinks and what feels like tapas.  Good place for an expensive date, most plates enough for 2 ppl only. 

Plates to try: fried rice, whole fried fish, jelly slaw, 

Plates to skip: fried watermelon sound cool but just warm cubes of water lemon, ribeye (meat was tough), duck meat was also tough, 

We ordered 3/4 of their small menu. They don't have all the items pictures on yelp. 

They have an excellent bottle of white wine, Chasselas I think from France? Yum. 

BEWARE: we found that the prices they charged on our bill was different and higher than the prices listed on their menu ??!! Shady right??! How does that even happen?? Our bottle of wine was listed for $75 and they charged $85 and a few other other items too, $38 listed charged $40 etc.  We verified the wine and they admitted their fault.  We let the other smaller differences go but SHADY BUSINESS PRACTICE OR INCOMPETENCE?! 

Just REMEMBER TO CHECK AND DOUBLE CHECK YOUR BILL. ITS SO EXPENSIVE ALEADY so I guess most people just assumed it was accurate."
El Charro,3,2020-02-03,"Came here the other day with my friend and ordered two tacos. The steak taco ($4) and the baja fish taco ($7.50). The steak taco was good, the meat was cooked nicely and tasted exactly like what I expected. Unfortunately the baja fish taco was a but underwhelming, kinda dry and just average tasting. The baja fish taco wasn't really worth the extra price, despite how big the piece of  fish was. The lime slices were also pretty dry but since it's winter now I can understand how it happened. 

In general the tacos here are just average, give this place a try if you're in the area and trying to quickly satisfy your taco craving."
Khao San Road,3,2020-01-13,"Well my wife and I finally got around to try the new location of Khao San Road on Charlotte St. I love the decor and design of this location very interesting use of space, at first I thought there was only maybe room for about 20 people but as our server took us around the corner there was more seating for about another 20 to 30 people. The ambiance is really loud here and the back tables are mainly long high tops so plan to share with other people. 

The service is ok nothing too over the top but I give them a benefit of a doubt cause it was lunch time and it was full house and the servers were all running around. It didn't take long to flag our server down for some additional napkins, however our water glasses were empty and no one came around to refill until we asked. 

The food was ok as well we had ordered the Garlic Tofu and Garlic Chicken to start. Both appetizers were very crunchy and crispy the garlic taste was a bit muted in my opinion both also come with a ramekin of the typical Thai sweet chili dipping sauce. Very crunchy exterior which locked in all the juice inside.

I ordered the Pad Gra Prao with beef add $1 and fried egg add $1 which is basically a dry curry with beef, red peppers, onions, red and green chili peppers and also a perfectly cooked sunny side up egg on top of white jasmine rice. I found that the beef was slightly too salty and too dry. Overall 3.5 / 5 for me. 

We also ordered the Khao Soi which is a soup noodle with egg noodles in a curry based soup. We opted to get the beef option for an additional $1. The presentation was really nice flavours were good slightly on the sweet side for my liking but when lime juice is added the flavour sort of balanced itself out. I think this is a 4 / 5 for me.

Overall just another Thai restaurant in the city that serves authentic Thai food. But didn't really blow me away.

FeiJai Out!"
Tacos El Asador,3,2020-02-22,"So I'm from San Diego. It is VERY hard for me to find anything even close in taste and quality.

This place has high ratings on here, so we decide to take a shot.

I regret that decision. I ordered three tacos (beef, pastor, carnitas.) The beef tasted like beef jerky, the pastor was super dry and bland, the carnitas tasted like cat food. 

Also you can't just order a small side of chips. It's $10 nachos or $11 guacamole (does it come with chips? Who knows?!)

Super disappointed. Literally had to get boba tea immediately after to cleanse the pallet."
Chula Taberna Mexicana,3,2019-10-06,"Friendly service and accommodated a baby no problem on busy Sunday evening.

I tried 3 types of tacos and the standout was the fish taco for me. I absolutely loved my margarita with the star anise spice in it. Must try!
The calamari was pretty weak, very small portions and fried batter falling off.

I would return to try a burrito, they looked massive."
King’s Tacos,4,2020-02-16,"Didn't expect much going into the restaurant but was quite surprised by how roomy it is inside. They can easily host parties with reservations.

We ordered a burrito and one of the make-your-own tacos. Everything was nicely seasoned and they had free chips to start. They also offered 3 types of dips ranging from mild to spicy. Great service with big portions of food. Would come back again"
Levetto,3,2020-05-20,"Freshly made, high quality ingredients. However for me, it was made with too much pepper and it was lacking flavour and creaminess. If an egg yolk was used, I could not taste it. I usually love carbonara, but I would not order this again."
La Carnita,1,2018-09-24,"Totally disappointing - everything is definitely on the over-seasoned/extremely salty side. Or totally BURNT! 

The chips we were served were totally burnt and we were told they were the batch of the day and there was nothing they can do about it. (Check pic)

The chips were followed by a totally burnt batch of corn- were not talking grill marks here, crust black corn. We were told that how it's severed (no it's not, we've been here before!). Is there no one to check what comes out of the kitchen??

To add insult to injury chewed on an avocado pit in the guacamole. 

Hosting and service were another issue. Extremely disappointing experience all in all. Fails at all basic hospitality and restaurant standard."
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine,2,2019-11-17,"Tried the Dim Sum at dinner time- the quality leaves much to be desired although the food was hot and served with typical efficient minimalist ( they did top up your tea promptly) service. The Xiao long bao was completely dry; Char siew bao was dry and flakey ( below expectations). Pricey for the lack of quality.

Saw that they had Tiger beer which was a pleasant surpise 

We probably won't be coming back again ."
Chula Taberna Mexicana,3,2019-08-02,"I came here with a friend and ordered the beef and the fish tacos. The food was pretty good, but the restaurant was quite busy so the food took a long time to arrive. The restaurant was also nicely decorated and the rooftop area was very nice.

Unfortunately the service was pretty bad, and we waited over 15 minutes just to order. Probably won't be returning because of this."
Stelvio,3,2020-02-14,"meeeeeeh.... I really wasn't all that impressed with this place. 

The decor and service were really good for sure. But the food was just OK. Considering how many amazing Italian restaurants there are in Toronto, I would not come back to this one. 

One thing that really surprised me was that the food was cold and didn't taste fresh. It sort of tasted like it had been reheated. 

The appetizers were fine but not amazing. The risotto, osso buco, and pasta did not live up to the hype -- just imo."
Byblos,3,2019-09-14,"The food and cocktails were exceptional. Truly. We tried the ahi tuna, beets with labneh, black truffle rice, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, marcona almonds and olives. All delicious and beautiful.  

Unfortunately, our server was a bit snooty. She didn't seem to approve of our ordering style, which was surprising considering the menu seemed to emphasize shareables. We preferred to try many small plates as opposed to a main. Nonetheless, she kept pushing for more; insisting the sides and rice were meant to be paired with a main protein."
Fusaro’s Kitchen,3,2018-11-30,"A cheerful relaxed place to grab a large bowl of hot pasta that will fill you up and keep you carb happy. The pasta isn't freshly made (I don't think so at least) but the addition of quality sauces and fresh ingredients still makes it one delicious meal. They make a mean sandwich also! 

Service was relaxed but prompt, probably to keep up with the peak hour crowds. Definitely worth it if all you want is some straight forward Italian."
Gusto 101,3,2020-01-18,"Coming here for the 3rd time because I was craving pizza. We got a seat right away around 7pm on Friday on the lower floor. Nice candlelit tables, dim, however very loud and we had to shout across the table to hear each other.

Went with the basic margarita pizza and fries. Despite my food coming fast, my pizza was cold :( Probably waited on the counter too long because my bf's pizza was warm. Thin and crunchy, I had a salt craving that day lol.

The fries tasted like layz fries (oily and crunchy) but airier. Comes with light garlic sauce.

Decided to try a panna cotta for dessert (blood orange for 10.99) I'm sad to say this is one of the worst desserts i've tasted, just wasn't my cup of tea. I thought it would be a custard consistency considering it's heavy cream based, but it came in a cup instead. And it wasn't creamy nor sweet- it was really sour! The orange froth on top was okay but then you get to orange chunks in the middle that's really tangy, and at the bottom you have olive oil?? My taste buds did not like the combination of olive oil and orange. Sorry, but i couldn't finished it :/"
Bar Buca,3,2018-04-11,"Came here for brunch on Sunday and it was way off the mark. While the ambiance is nice, it was moderately loud and you may be asked to share a table with another group. That didn't bother us really -- the fail point was that they were out of so much stuff and the waitress didn't let us know before we spent a good ten minutes with the menu. No steak. Shoot.

The other failpoint was how their trout brunch menu item is basically like a few bits of fish and citrus. It's definitely not an entree and more of an appetizer. While the waitress did seem to communicate that a tad, I think we definitely expected something different.

The egg dish with the bread was pretty good and tasty and the winner, but portion-wise it also wasn't super filling, but the eggs were perfect. My goat meat focaccia sandwich was decent and tasty -- but I left the meal a bit hungry..I do think maybe we got unlucky with the amount of things they were out of and I do think the chef can cook...I just think the more appetizer-y items should be more clearly labeled and explained."
Buca Yorkville,5,2018-11-21,"Amazing fiancé chose this restaurant- we love Italian. Welcomed and seated right away for our reservation last night. 

Excellent service. Never wanting. 
We split the beet salad. Outstanding. 

My angel hair lobster main dish was expertly prepared. Fiancé had the whole octopus with pearl pasta and charred artichoke hearts. Definitely great. 

Glad we could walk there. Doubly glad to experience this restaurant. 

Our only wish: with such a fine dining restaurant, the bread service should have been gratis. We did pay for the focaccia and it was excellent; however, very few restaurants in this price point charge for bread service."
Agio,3,2020-04-24,"Terrific food, poor atmosphere, great customer service.  They deliver and are open during covid!"
Yummy Yummy Dumplings,5,2019-11-23,"One of the best dumplings  family restaurant!!! 
We visited the place about 6 years ago and were super impressed with the food. That was the first time ever I've tried dumplings.
In October we were in Toronto and decided to visit this place again. We are still impressed with deliciousness and quality of the food. We ordered several different dishes and they all have been made for us from scratch -- handmade dumplings  are sooooo goooood!!!! If you are in town, make sure stop by that amazing family restaurant!!!!!!!!"
House of Gourmet,3,2019-04-19,"House of Gourmet is a great spot for late night Chinese food with huge portion at reasonable price! However, don't expect anything extraordinary because you get what you pay for. 

On all of my visits, even ones at 2AM, the place was constantly busy so service always seemed so rushed. The restaurant offers a several options of typical Chinese dishes such as dumplings, fried noodles/rice, soup, etc. My go-to is definitely seafood congee! It is cooked to just the right consistency, not too watery or too thick. Seafood includes shrimp, fish fillet, abalone, scallop, squid and small pieces of ginger that really brings out the flavor! The portion for a small congee is super filling that will likely keep you full until the next meal. I've also tried their noodles soup with BBQ duck & BBQ a few times but it was meh. One time I'd find the broth to be too bland, and other times it was so salty. Other than that, the noodles also comes with generous amount at decent price.

Overall, House of Gourmet is definitely a good choice for late night food, but the quality doesn't really stand out from other restaurants."
Khao San Road,4,2020-02-22,"I normally go for red curry but decided to try the yellow curry for the first time as it was the special of the day. I loved it, the potato's are a great touch. 

Will definitely be back soon to take advantage of the curry of the day lunch special!"
Asian Legend,5,2019-04-05,This place was AMAZING. We ordered a ton of items on the menu and everything is delicious. We all highly recommend this Chinese restaurant. Yum!
El Charro,2,2018-08-27,"Had an appointment across the street so I saw this Mexican place and decided to try it out. It's very nicely decorated -- vibrant colours, a mural, and lots of Mexican decor. 

I decided to go with a veggie burrito as I am vegetarian, which came up to $9 flat. I was told at the cash that it's 10% off if you pay with cash (not sure if that's an everyday thing but at least I know for next time). Anyways, I was served right away and I was in and out within five minutes I'd say. The burrito itself was not the greatest--pretty bland compared to other veggie burritos I've eaten (and I eat a lot of them lol). I've also never had a burrito with broccoli, cauliflower and carrots in it so this was a first for me . Honestly tasted like I had some type of Asian stirfry in my burrito which really threw me off. Guacamole is supposed to be included but I couldn't even taste it . To be honest I didn't finish a quarter the burrito because I just didn't enjoy it at all. A piece of the cauliflower actually fell on the ground by accident there was a bunch of pigeons around me that really enjoyed it lol  

Would I come back? Probably not. If I was in the area I'd be open to trying something else on the menu because I see a lot of great reviews but I don't see myself ever coming out of my way to come here again."
Khao San Road,5,2019-08-12,"Shared the Squash Fritters (gra bong) with 3 people as appetizers. It was such a perfect start - crispy, fried to perfection, and not oily. The sweet dip enhances the taste and makes you munch on it again and again. For main, I had the Khao Soi, it was absolutely amazing. It's by far the best Khao Soi I've had in Downtown Toronto (I've tried PAI, Sabai Sabai, Sukhothai and Salad King). I love the soup, and the noodles blend perfectly well with it. The overall ambience is trendy and in an elegant, modern setting. There are plenty of seats (has a 2nd floor).

Khao San Road's portions is big - it's around the same price as the other Thai places but leaves you way more satisfied. My recommendation is to avoid the ridiculous line up at PAI and come here instead for equally (if not better) Thai food."
Mi Taco Taqueria,3,2018-09-06,"Visited Mi Taco Taqueria for a quick snack - guacamole with chips ($4). The nachos did not tasted fresh. I felt like the guacamole and chips ratio is off. It was very disappointing. Perhaps the other items are better. 

Not a big fan. I may be back to give it a second chance to try the tacos."
Giulietta,4,2018-10-31,"My outlook improved when the burrata ($30) was set on the table. The cheese draped with thin slices of salty prosciutto, why mess with a great combination? 

Since the bread wasn't toasted or oiled, it was a bit chewy and difficult to get a knife through, so if it was cut thinner it would be even better. The caramelized onion and fig spread on the bread was absolutely delicious and went so nicely with the milky flavourful cheese, which was served at a perfect room temperature. The staggering $30 price tag was a bit of a surprise though... note to self, always ask for prices with specials.  

Well marbled beef was used in the carne cruda di chianina ($19) and while I couldn't taste the fried garlic mentioned on the menu, the anchovy was an interesting addition to the mix. We're asked if we'd like a side of bread ($3) which, in my opinion, is a must. You really need something to spread the beef tartare on or it'd be way too salty and overpowering on its own. For those that are abstaining from carbs, perhaps a salad would help balance the flavourful beef.

Even one of Giulietta's pizzas would be a great shared starter. The l'amentea ($21) has a healthy portion of spicy soppressata and tons of garlic that would give Count Dracula a scare. I love garlic so found it went nicely with the soppressata, but did drown out the fior di latte, which became more for its creamy chewy texture than flavour. The well blistered crust was coloured evenly and had a lovely chewy texture, but could be thicker in the middle as the paper-thin centre became lost amongst the sauce."
Los Guaca-Moles,3,2017-04-29,"3.5. Actually. We were attempting to visit the Seven Lives Pop Up on Bloor, but the door was locked on Friday night at 7pm. We had seen the sandwich board for Los Guaca Moles on the street and decided that fate wanted us to visit this place instead. 

They were insanely busy during the dinner rush and we sat at the bar for a while waiting while the two staff who were running the bar and the floor got caught up. I have no problem with slow service as long as they keep the drinks coming. They were also apologetic and thanked us for our patience. 

We ordered the Guacamole with crickets which was a decent size and there was nothing wrong with the chips despite what other reviewers have said. The bartender brought us some nice habernero sauce that had a wonderful spice that sneaks up on you. The Pulpo Tostadas were bit too sweet for me. The octopus was tender, but the sauce ruined the flavour a bit for me. I aded more habernero sauce and they were better.

Tacos were loaded with fillings. The fish was dusted in cornmeal and cooked to soft perfection. Chorizo was interesting and quite good, but I""ll confess I only ordered it because they didn't have the liver taco available. The Lengua (tongue) taco was my favourite and reminded me of Mexico. 

There were also a few items going out that looked really delicious and unique to the restaurant. I'd love to go back and try out. 

Overall, I think Los Guaca Moles may be going through a few growing pains, but this leaves more room for them to grow! I'd go back and give them another go. The atmosphere was fun and intimate without being too crowded and I'd love to check out their cozy patio on a warmer night."
La Carnita,3,2019-08-21,"My friends and I (6+ people) came on a Tuesday for the Tuesday special where you get 8 hardshell tacos to share. My friends ordered the other tacos and really liked the 'In Cod We Trust' taco. We also had quesadillas, corn, and churros (really delicious btw, I highly recommend). I also ordered a cocktail and was surprised at the alcohol content, despite the small portion. Overall, I found the food to be really tasty and well seasoned! I just found the portion sizes to be quite small for the prices they were charging.

Our server did a great job on checking up on us and keeping up with our orders. We would occassionally just blurt out to add another item and I was impressed that they remembered it all- thank you!! Our server was also quite engaging, which made this place very welcoming and down to earth. 

The interior is decorated quite nicely and this place is very hipster. I would also recommend booking a table because, despite the numerous amounts of tables, quite a lot of them were reserved. There is also a bar for people who want to pop by for drinks only. 

The food came at a timely manner and the place was quite comfy. We were decently full but the prices really weren't worth the portion sizes we were given. This knocked back a few stars for me. Also, the bill could not be separated so figuring that out with a large group was not so favorable. Being a large group, we were not notified about the automatic gratuity until we asked for the bill at the end."
Juicy Dumpling,5,2020-02-20,"If you want something quick and fast, and you want soup dumplings. This is the place to go. They serve food like it is fast food but the quality is perfect.
You order your food at the counter, the menu is limited but worth trying everything. The prices are really cheap as well, and as for the quality, the soup dumplings were pretty good. 
After you order your food they give you a buzzer, as I would call it. You take a sit and wait for the buzzer to vibrate. You grab your food, get your condiments and bon appetite. 
So if you are in the area and want some fast soup dumpling, definitely check this place out. Will be worth your time."
Donatello Restaurant,5,2019-08-15,"Gorgeous patio, friendly service, and amazing food. This place feels like you are dining at an Italian house. They have an extensive menu, and the portion sizes are pretty big. We tried Caesar salad, gnocchi and the salmon dish plus a dessert which was really good but I don't remember the name of. Everything was delicious. They are really generous with their parmesan, which they only add to each dish after serving it to you. Service was great; we ended up chatting with our server in the end for a while who turned out to be such a lovely person! They put a lot of effort into making their patio look good. I recommend reserving a table on the upstairs patio. The tree right in front of the restaurant is decorated with lights and it makes the whole place so beautiful and romantic with all the lighting and colourful flowers. 

I liked everything about this restaurant. Will be back for sure to try their other dishes."
Wilbur Mexicana,3,2019-12-08,"Gringo af. Lunch and dinner lines go out the door. Don't come here for your undersalted chips and measly-portioned guac. The meat was kind of too salty and even having three tacos made me want a fourth. I guess it's FINE that there's fish tacos but it's kind of overrated. Where is the cilantro?!?! 

I have had better. It's got an Assembly Chef's Hall vibe. It's loud, jammed full of working professionals. Only come here if everything else is closed."
Bar Buca,3,2018-08-27,"I reallyyyy wanted to like this place, I was truly excited to try it. 
The ambiance, the decor and the service were all great. But the food was just average for me. 

I really loved the caffè con zabaglione (espresso with sweet italian custard ) It was honestly the highlight of our meal. The Italian Custard gave it a wonderful sweet taste, similarly to how coffee with bailey's would taste. 

Unfortunately they didn't have many Gluten Free options or Vegetarian options, but we managed. 

I ordered the strapazzate dish (pulled mixed farm eggs, burrata & black truffles ) While to some it might seem like a delicate egg dish, to me, it tasted quite bland and lacked flavour. There was essentially no seasoning in the egg. All you tasted was plain egg with burrata cheese. 

I might come back here for a pastry and a coffee, but not for a meal"
Dumpling House Restaurant,3,2020-04-22,"This place has great dumplings (especially their pan fried ones, pork and chive is my fave), but there was one time when I went, maybe almost 2 years ago that really pissed me off. I would be more inclined to give this place 4 stars if it weren't for poor customer treatment. 

It was busy in the restaurant and a line was forming. My friend and I had just finished our meal. I had ordered a soy milk and was finishing it while also trying to buy tickets for a movie on my phone. I was aware that there was a lineup and I was trying to hurry but not chug my drink, but I was still finishing so I didn't think it would be an issue. One of the older ladies who runs the restaurant (in Chinese we would call her the 'lao ban niang') complained loudly and angrily to her staff in Chinese that I was playing on my phone and ordered them to clean our table up in an effort to get us to leave. It doesn't sound too bad when I type it out but it's just different in Chinese and her tone was angry. Only my mom talks to me like that when she's scolding me. I was very annoyed when I heard this, but finished my drink and got up to leave. The same woman put on a fake smile and said ""thank you!"" as we walked out the door. 

In this case, she probably didn't think I would understand her, which is probably also why she said what she said, but it really ruined my meal. Unfortunately for her, I understood every word. I hope they will exercise more caution when talking about customers in Chinese. I am Asian so I am used to less than ideal service at some mom and pop restaurants so I am understanding of most service at Chinese restaurants but I also don't like being scolded behind my back, and then treated so drastically different to my face.

In that moment I dramatically vowed never to return but the dumplings are too good and I have since returned and had pleasant experiences.

I mean, I doubt the woman even remembers that this happened but it was a bad enough experience that I felt compelled to write about it so long after, but the food is still good and I would recommend this place to people who don't mind feeling rushed when they eat. 

I like the potato threads and shanghai noodles in addition to boiled and pan fried dumplings."
Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant,5,2019-12-12,"Put this place at the top of my list to try in Toronto, and it did not disappoint. The place is huge! If you have a large party, I would recommend making a reservation. There are so many options to choose from, but we went with the lobster tower (4 course meal). This includes, snow pea leaves, lobster tower, fried rice and dessert which was just macarons. The lobster tower was delicious! So much flavor! No sauce needed. The service was really nice, they came by and changed our plates and asked us what we needed a couple of times. 


Note: It is cash only!"
Sichuan Garden Restaurant,1,2020-02-10,"This restaurant was formerly known as ""Sichuan Garden Restaurant"" and re-opened last year as ""Ten Miles B.B.Q"".  After reading positive reviews about their Dan Dan Noodles and Sichuan cuisine I popped in alone for a quick lunch.  I was greeted with a very confusing menu.   I wanted to order a few sides, but was advised by the server that my selections were too small. She did not suggest any alternatives.  All of the multiple small plates seem to have only one ingredient and no options for combination dishes like a mixed vegetable platter. I am happy to pay more for more content, but $12 for just bok choy? $6 for one small skewer of basic mushrooms? had to call her over twice until she finally helped me narrow it down to Dan Dan Noodles and a mushroom pot. I was hungry and desperate to order anything at this point.  THEY GAVE ME THE BILL BEFORE THE FOOD ARRIVED.  The Dan Dan Noodles were tasty, but after that the server and kitchen staff seemed to prioritize take out orders over mine.  At about 45 mins + from when I walked I had to flag two servers to ask about the mushroom pot I had ordered.  The kitchen staff had only just started the dish! At that point I paid for what I had eaten and walked out.    If you want UNHELPFUL ,SLOW & UNATTENTIVE servers and kitchen staff that (prioritize Uber Eats orders over sit down guests) and don't own up to their mess ups than you might enjoy this restaurant.  I myself will NEVER RETURN.  There are thousands of restaurants in the GTA. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY on this one! P.S. The management was non-existent. P.P.S. THEY GAVE ME THE BILL BEFORE I HAD EVEN RECEIVED THE FOOD!"
Los Guaca-Moles,3,2019-05-11,"Not impressed. I really wanted to like this place. From the reviews it seemed like this was a hidden gem type of place bit all I found there was mediocre overpriced food and indifferent service.
Had the queso fundido which was decent but not great, not hot enough so the cheese was already hardening up, chorizo was bland, also a small portion with only four tortillas for twelve dollars.
The elotes were ok, nothing special. One cob cut in thirds.
The tacos though were really disappointing. Had a fish, a calamari, and a cactus. Three for fifteen dollars was the deal. The fish and calamari were tiny nuggets of tasteless breaded frozen seafood, the nopales tasted like they were straight out of a can. They were all bizarrely garnished with two cucumber half-moons, the fish was garnished with the usual cabbage slaw. 
The two salsas provided were the best part of the meal.
The service was inattentive at best, water was never refilled, waiters were wandering around aimlessly with salsas and dishes, not knowing where they were going. Never were asked how the food was or if we needed anything.
Not a negative experience per se but not one that I care to experience again."
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine,3,2019-09-21,"Dynasty is a decent spot if you're looking for Chinese food in the area. The place is nice inside (given its location in Yorkville), and the food selection is quite typical - similar to those found in other Cantonese restaurants. Nothing out of the ordinary. They offer an evening dim sum menu (a slightly condensed version of the regular dim sum selection). Service is pretty good and food comes out quick."
La Carnita,3,2019-02-16,"I came here for a birthday dinner on Saturday at 8pm. We were a party of 5 and didn't have a reservation so our wait time was around 1hr but only because a reservation was cancelled. If it wasn't, we probably would have waited closer to 2hrs. 
Every time I come to La Carnita, I always get the pollo frito taco but unfortunately they sold out :( I ended up getting the achiote chicken instead and I didn't read the description properly so completely overlooked the jalapeno salsa part. It was so spicy for me, I was tearing up but completely my fault for not reading the menu lol. 
The service was quick, we received our order of Mexican Corn shortly after we placed our order and our tacos came out just before we finished the corn. 

This location is a little cramped for my liking but the food quality is the same with all the other places. I've always enjoyed my dining experience at La Carnita. A reservation is strongly recommended though, otherwise you might have to wait over an hour like I did."
Quetzal,3,2018-12-22,"I had high expectations for this restaurant based on other reviews but for me, it ended up being just an average meal. 

The restaurant itself is very nice inside. The decor is unique and the feel of the restaurant is upscale yet welcoming. Staff are very friendly and professional. I don't particularly enjoy the high seats we had, but that's just me. The menu is a bit confusing so we had a lot of questions, and our server was happy to explain. There were four of us dining and we had intended on ordering our own food, but apparently this restaurant suggests more of a ""family style"" dining experience. I feel that this is a lazy way of serving, as you're basically told that they don't care about timing your food to come out together, so it's suggested you share whatever comes out first. Not my favourite way to eat when I'm dining with people I don't know very well.

One of the guys at our table wanted to order a drink that was under the ""Large Format"" heading, which our server explained was meant to share. She also said it could be served as a single drink if he wanted. I read the description (Velvet Krush) and decided I'd also like to try it. When our drinks were brought out, it was served as a single drink with two straws. I don't know what made her think that two people sitting on opposite ends of the table from each other would want to share a drink like that, but we sent it back requesting two separate glasses. Even if we had been a couple, I would not want to share a drink like that. Very strange. At least the drink was really good. Something I would definitely have again. 

We ordered a few ceviche dishes to start. Most of the dishes were good, but at this price point, I honestly expected to be wowed at least with some of the dishes. The presentation was exceptional, which is probably why I was disappointed, as I expected everything to taste as good as it looked. I did enjoy the scallop ceviche - probably my favourite dish of all the ones I tried. 

I had the hanger steak as my main with a side of grilled mushrooms. The steak was cooked rare, which I found to be a bit rubbery. Had it been cooked a bit more to mid-rare, it probably would have been perfect. Because they sliced the steak before bringing to the table, there's not much you can do to salvage it, aside from ordering a new one. Given the two-hour window they impose, I wasn't prepared to chance it, as we were over 2/3 of our time already. The mushrooms also looked better than they tasted, as I felt the broth kind of watered down the mushroom flavour rather than enhancing it. I also tasted the grilled fish and the coal roasted sweet potato, but neither was to my liking. It seemed like the char from the grill kind of overpowered everything else. 

At the end of the meal, there was nothing really outstanding for me. I'd return if I was with other people who wanted to try it, but can't say I'd rush back anytime soon."
Donatello Restaurant,3,2020-02-09,"My group and I came here to celebrate a birthday. There were issues with the reservation, as they had only called to confirm the day of the event, and we found we weren't being treated appropriately because of it by the hostess/first waiter upstairs that we received. It also may have been because of young age compared to the rest of their customers. If you plan to visit, make reservations and make sure there are no miscommunications before arriving. 

They ended up being able to accommodate us and our new waiter downstairs was very friendly and helpful. Despite the service in the beginning, it was quickly turned around with good service and great food. I ordered the gnocchi and it was delicious and filling. 

This place felt more like a date spot than a spot for large parties, there are a few floors, but it's still small. The food would be 5/5 for me but with the initial service, had to give it a 3."
La Carnita,3,2019-11-23,"We went on a Friday night and the wait was 40 minutes, so we decided to explore the area near us until we received a text that our table was ready. They led us to our table only to find that people were still sitting there. It took them 15 minutes to figure out another table for us. When we finally sat down, we were given menus and the food here is not cheap at all. We decided to get some chips and salsa to share with 2 tacos each. The salsa came in a tiny container that was barely enough for one person. We waited another 45 minutes for the tacos for them to be cold."
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos,4,2020-01-21,"Came here before during my visit in Toronto and really enjoyed this place. There isn't much room to sit or eat, but they give you sauces and likes for your tacos. 
Food -
Cabeza : very tender meat and lots of sauce. Would definitely get it again.
The fish taco I had here was very good as well. 
The prices here are a little much but the quality of the food makes up for it. Definitely worth coming for a bite."
Noodle King,4,2018-10-20,"Visited a Friday at 11h30am.. Within the next 15 minutes, the line up became huge. Ordered the spicy beef soup for 9.99, as well as fried pork dumplings (3 for 2.59)... Pop is a buck a can
 Soup was beefy, meat was tender and tasty, broth was nice, noodles were a bit bland (Shangai style). Dumplings were tasty and worth it."
