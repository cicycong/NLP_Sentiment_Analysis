El Trompo Taco Bar,3,2019-07-09,Their margaritas are excellent but their tacos aren't as good as they used to be. They are very simple - which isn't a bad thing *if* the few ingredients used standout and are prepared well. The pork was dry and the overall taco was flat - it didn't have the bright acidic flavours or freshness that I love in a taco.  The fish was tender but the chipotle sauce was overwhelming and I couldn't taste much beyond that. The queso fundido with mushrooms and onions was delicious and flavourful - it reminded me of French Onion soup. This place used to have delicious tacos years ago- hopefully I feel the same way about it soon.
Trattoria Nervosa,3,2020-01-11,"A very popular Italian restaurant, but didn't quite live up to the hype.

We came on a hot summer day and it was very crowded. We ended up getting a seat upstairs outside on the balcony, but it was very crowded--both in terms of people and seating space.
The seats were pretty minuscule and packed together. There was barely enough space for us to squeeze between the tables to sit down on the outer seats--despite being on the thinner side myself. My other friends, who chose to sit on the inner side, would definitely not be able to squeeze into the outer seats because they are tall men who also hit the gym--their extra pound of muscles already cut them from sitting here, so I can only imagine the types of people who are regular patrons. 

We got the calamaratato con gamberi, mafalde al funghi, rigatoni bologanese, and risotto nervosa.
The server recommended the calamaratato con gamberi since it was a popular dish with some spiciness, but it was quite lackluster. The dish wasn't spicy at all, granted we're quite accustomed to spicy foods. 
The mafalde al funghi was delicious and creamy with a full bodied flavour. 
The rigatoni bologanese was a very typical pasta that tasted like a deconstructed lasagna--which isn't a bad thing. It felt too commonplace and lackluster for this price point though.
The risotto nervosa was probably the star of the show. The risotto is amazing and creamy and the braised beef pairs well with it. Though I will admit that the beef, when eaten on its own, felt a little dry. 

Perhaps it's because I'm more accustomed to Asian food, but this restaurant felt quite underwhelming and overpriced.
Many of the dishes didn't stand out too much and is quite comparable to what you would find at much lower price points or even store bought. Don't get me wrong, the food was good, but perhaps not worthy of a second visit."
Bar Buca,3,2019-06-16,"Went for the 4-6 aperitivo where you get a token to fill a small plate with food for every alcoholic beverage you order. Love the concept except wish they had some non alcoholic drinks options as well (not everyone drinks!)... you can add $5 if you order a nonalcoholic drink but still want the plate of food. The drinks are all around $15... a little pricey but expected. Although you can get beer for $7. The food was pretty decent, the flatbread and lemon ricotta were my faves. Service was pretty bad though... no one checked on us. And my friend who came late and ordered didn't get her drink until like 20 min later. No one seemed to be at the bar making her drink until we reminded them and no apologies given."
Donatello Restaurant,3,2018-12-02,"Super average food with inflated prices. It's a small place so you have to make reservations even on a week night. 
The veggie pasta that I got (linguine with cream sauce and mushrooms) costed me 20 bucks without tax. The pasta was al dente which I liked but lacked much flavour. The portion size on the other hand was big. 
The calamari was also around $20 but was well cooked. I just wish we got more pieces :( They charred it nicely but by the time it made it to our table it was cold. 
The sever talked super fast but was friendly and happy. Not sure if I will return because I wasn't impressed with anything!"
Asian Legend,1,2017-10-17,"Without question the worst cashew nut chicken I ever unfortunately ordered...
Smaller than most restaurants portions, to top it off; $18.01 for garbage food.
There are many WRONGS in this world; a bad meal is pretty low in the grand scheme of things/life.  BUT; a garbage meal is still a garbage meal.  Staff looked miserable, absolutely unpleasant.  I don't need an ass-kissing or TLC at a fast food Chinese restaurant, this was depressing.  Waste of money, waste of time."
Lee Chen Asian Bistro,4,2019-12-22,"The service was fast, staff was friendly. Their soup wanton was so good I had to get two orders! The soup within the steamed dumpling was complimented beautifully with their pickled ginger & red vinegar! The pork belly bao was interesting since you can construct it yourself, and the flavour of the marinated pork was mouthwatering. However, the menu is very long and the main dishes   are an afterthought compared to their dim sum."
La Marquesita,3,2019-06-03,"The place is a small take away joint near Ryerson University, a one amongst many others serving different cuisines. It is an open seating arrangement with 4 large picnic tables and the food carts around it. It was a nice sunny, windy day, perfect to get some spicy food.  Between the three of us we got

CHICKEN TEQUITA: a deep fried taco with guacamole and chicken. Could have been slightly more spicy. It was well marinated. 

CARNITAS TORTAS: this was delicious, a big CARNITAS loaded sandwich served with some nachos on the side. 

I like my Mexican to be slightly more spicy and a little more tangy, this was alright but I have had better and would keep experimenting till I find the flavor."
La Chingada,3,2020-03-02,"Went last week on Thursday to try their all you can eat Tacos. Nice hand made tortillas. I tried Beef, Carnitas, Pastor and Barbacoa. They were okish, the beef meat wasn't too good. Barbacoa was nice. Very well served with lots of meat. The salsas were in a bottle mild, medium and hot. Not very typical Mexican salsas in terms of flavour and freshness. A friend ordered a slice of Tres leches cake and something was off, the milk on it was not very good tbh so it wasn't eaten. So $19 for all you can eat, 3 tacos first and then one taco at the time. It wasn't completely bad but I doubt I will be back."
Mi Taco Taqueria,3,2018-07-03,"If I ever need a quick fix for Taco's I would probably go back. The tacos were small, small amounts of filling but overall the taste was not bad. You get 3 small Tacos for $10 something. I wish they were a bit bigger and there was more topping options. 

Keep Eating, 
Angela"
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine,3,2017-06-23,"Dim sum in the heart of Yorkville, honestly coming from Richmond Hill (read: right beside Markham!) I wasn't expecting much. I expected average, bland tasting classics like har gow (shrimp dumplings) and siu mai (steamed pork bites wrapped in wonton-like skin). We arrived as a table of 7 on a weekday and the place was fairly empty - understandable, dim sum usually is a longer meal not favoured for a workday lunch hour. We ordered a bit of everything and some of us were looking for specific items - everyone found what they were looking for! There were a decent variety and many classics on the menu - some that aren't often found even in Markham because they're complex to make and don't sell for high prices.

The highlights were the fritter wrapped in rice roll, the osmanthus cake, and the mini octopus in curry sauce. Often the rice rolls are squishy and lack texture, but this one was a good consistency that complemented the crunchy (not chewy!) dough fritter. The osmanthus cake came with a base layer of coconut milk, providing additional flavour and texture that agreed with the table's demands for desserts that're not too sweet but still *something*. We also ordered steamed sponge cake - it was soft and fluffy, steaming hot. The realization the sponge cake was steamed baffled some, and the softness and light flavour was well received. It could've had more of the signature taste, but it was a decent attempt at the classic.

Overall for the location I was pleasantly surprised, and prices were aligned to the area as well. Unfortunately from a dim sum in Toronto perspective, I didn't feel like it was anywhere close to great and it definitely wasn't worth the price paid. Service was good and accommodating to the non-Chinese speakers, but translations were odd and made it more difficult to understand what things were in some cases. I'll be back for team lunches looking for exotic options and a group feeling because we're all at a round table, but aside that I'll stick with my suburb options."
Lee Chen Asian Bistro,4,2019-11-01,"First glance of the clientele was a solid sign it would be authentic stuff.  The food was very good! I didn't think it was that ""pricey"" till you think about how inexpensive authentic Dim sum food can generally be. And the bill wasn't what many other reviewers are probably used to. I think still worth it for the most part. 

The crystal pork belly was great. The thick noodles in the fried Shanghai noodles where delicious and greasy. The soup dumplings were good, but I think these miss the value to price point the most. 

I would definitely come back. Just be aware it is business district prices."
Nodo Restaurant,5,2018-06-24,"The "" U Chiurito"" pizza will be the reason I return to Nodo. After visiting Sicily last summer, pistachio on pizza was something I constantly came across, so to find this in Toronto was more than I could have ever hoped for!

The texture of the Brussels sprouts along with the cheese, pistachio and arugula pesto make this pizza fresh, meaty (without meat!) and eating every last bite. The warm olives, the burrata, the coccoli - this place does not disappoint.

Service, ambiance, food are all on point at both locations. I would highly recommend it!"
Tacos El Asador,5,2019-09-03,"Great, authentic Mexican restaurant with a la carte menu items. Order one taco (or quesadilla or burrito or enchilada) or 50. Food came out very quickly and was amazing!

Warning: CASH ONLY!"
Khao San Road,4,2019-10-26,"Was in Toronto was a business meeting and one of my favorite foods in the city is Thai food. New York doesn't even come close to the amazing quality of Thai food you get here!

I got the Garlic Chicken ($12.50) as appetizers. An absolutely amazing dish and I definitely recommend it. Most tables were ordering it, so you won't go wrong with this one!

For mains, I got the Green Curry with Chicken ($17.50) with a spice level of 3. The spice level was good and my dish had a nice kick to it. The green curry with coconut milk was amazing too!

Service was good and food arrived within 20 minutes of ordering. Music was a little too loud to my liking, but the restaurant realized it eventually and reduced the volume!"
Good Hombres,5,2018-11-17,"Good Hombres serve elevated tacos that bring sentiments of great, authentic Mexican food. Prepared with care and attention, this delicious meal is perfectly true in every way. On the northwest side of Dundas and Bathurst (look for the TACOS TACOS TACOS window), there is a little mystic tortilla-making machine that sends fresh, perfectly perfect tortillas onto a conveyor belt - made on demand. 

When you enter the modern, casual, grab-and-go, airy taco joint, you're greeted by colours of blue and yellow, stainless steel, and bar seating that lines the spacious frontline kitchen where you see the magic happen. The taco menu is diverse but everything is delicious. $3.75 per taco. Order 4 if you're hungry, 2-3 for a snack. The only seating is by the kitchen where there are condiments of pickled vegetables and a delicious ""salsa macha"" from Veracruz which is prepared with oil, chili and garlic. It's absolutely divine when drizzled on the tacos.

Their staple tacos, illustrated on a hand-written chalkboard menu, are colourful, whimsical creations that tickle your palate in flavours that are true to the history of the Mexican tortilla, and are served on fun bright vibrant plates:

1. Pastor: PORK shoulder, salsa macha, pineapple

2. Carne Asada: STRIPLOIN, salsa verde (green sauce)

3. Pescado: HADDOCK, lettuce, chipotle

4. Pollo Asado: CHICKEN thighs, salsa macha

5. Tinga de Pollo: CHICKEN breast, tomato, chipotle

6. Rajas Poblanas: roast poblano PEPPERS (a mild chili pepper from Puebla, Mexico), cotija (a hard cow's milk cheese from Mexico)

7. Chiles Toreados: shishito PEPPERS (a sweet, East Asian variety), black beans, salsa roja (red sauce)

8. Costillitas de Res: BEEF short ribs, salsa roja

9. Lengua: TONGUE, salsa macha, salsa verde

We had the tacos with haddock, beef short ribs, chicken tinga and tongue, and they were all flavourful bursts of juicy deliciousness; light and carefully crafted that looked so much fun to eat. It tastes like lots of time, effort, and love were folded in as the main ingredients in this timeless, traditional Mexican dish. We wanted to try them all-and we most definitely will next time (and as much as our waistline allows!).

On the menu, there's also:
- Quesadillas: $6
- Drinks: $2-3
- Masa (dough made from corn flour; used to make tortillas): $10/kg
- Tortillas: $14/kg

As a downtown Toronto Yelper, Good Hombres is midway between Dundas and Ossington (hipster mecca) and Chinatown (dim-sum heaven) and across the street from Toronto Western Hospital. But more importantly, it's a new taqueria that is worth coming back time after time for authentic, juicy, flavourful tacos that are a joy to eat. -Tell them Will and Justin from Yelp sent you here and wear your stretchiest pants, your belly will thank you.

House of Gourmet,3,2019-10-08,"Spontaneous craving for Chinese food but wanting to give other restaurants a chance in Chinatown led me to House of Gourmet. 

Portions are on the smaller side and they were decent enough to satisfy cravings. Wasn't much of a wow factor in my opinion. Ordered Yeung Chow fried rice, sweet and sour pork, beef soya sauce noodles, turnip cakes and snow peas for a group of 4. Topped it off with a iced lemon tea each."
Hacienda las Américas,1,2019-10-25,"Food was awful - worst tacos I've had in my entire life - the meat tasted funky like it had gone bad and was burnt. The rice was bland with zero seasoning. They never even brought out the app we asked for (but they did try to charge us for it). I have no idea how this place has so many high ratings, the only positive is the food is cheap (although even at this price point it's not worth it). Even the mojito was subpar.

Stay home and make your own - it'll probably taste like a Michelin restaurant in comparison."
Ristorante Sotto Sotto,5,2018-11-05,"Some of the best gnocchi I've ever had (and I'm a gnocchi connoisseur). Perfect portion size, still had room for dick after dinner."
Terroni,4,2019-09-03,"One of my favourite Italians in the city and not just for the food, this location is great for a meal out due to its ambience and the setting in such a historic, classic building - really adds to the experience!

Not to brag but being greedy I had a pizza, pasta and salad last time I went and all were great with fresh ingredients and the salad in particular was really refreshing sandwiched in between my carb medley!

Very good wine selection too.

PS - it you go on a date and it's rubbish they have jail cells underground sooo....."
Artisan Plus,3,2019-09-03,"So much hype we had to stop by and try it out. This place is newish to me located near Dundas and Bay and I've seen it being renovated months ago and thought the interior was really hip and modern looking. This is a noodle place that serves Northern Chinese style, the menu is very simple and don't have too many different things clouding your mind on what to eat. 

We ordered the Artisan Pork Jia Mo, and Shuan Tofu Sheet for starters. The pork Jia Mo is chopped braised pork belly with gravy served in a handcrafted artisan bread, this was not bad but flavour was slightly weak in my opinion. The tofu sheets are made from fresh sheets, this dish is served cold and almost like a salad with shredded peppers, bean sprouts, scallions, chilli, chilli oil, Sichuan pepper corns, and sesame oil. I found that the flavour is good not too much numbing spice and not too spicy but boy it did have tons of oil. 

For mains we ordered their Famous YoPo Biang Mian and the Wok Cumin Che Mian with Spring Lamb. the Biang mian has a lot going on with sauteed tomato, scrambled eggs, cauliflower, potato, carrot, woodear mushrooms, zucchini, edamame beans, paprika, and vinaigrette sitting under all these ingredients are some ribbon noodles which were slightly too long. I thought that this dish was a mixed with way too many things and the flavour got lost way too busy. The Wok Cumin Che Mian with Spring Lamb was better and the lamb wasn't gamy but I wish there was more slices of lamb. This dish I found was a little small for the price. 

Service was great our server was very knowledgeable about their product. She kept our water carafe topped with water. The food comes out very quick and displayed nicely. When it came time to pay the bill was ready and the server came with a debit machine as well. Be prepared to bring cash with you as this place is cash or debit only.

I will be back to try some soup noodles next time. Hopefully it will change my mind and get a better rating."
Grazie Ristorante,5,2019-11-16,"I absolutely love this place! I've been a whole 3 times. I've had the tasca twice, definitely a favourite! It's essentially a giant ravioli, filed with brie, mushrooms and spinach. Smothered in a rich rose sauce. It's huge and amazingly delicious. I went today and had the salmon pasta (forgot the name), and as usual simply amazing! The service is also outstanding. I've had Jordan twice, he's very friendly and efficient and definitely makes the experience! I don't usually leave my area for food, but Grazie is always worth the subway trip!"
El Charro,2,2020-04-18,"I added this to my list based on good Yelp reviews. We ordered a takeaway - burrito, quesadilla and corn chips. Overall the food was not fresh, the burrito was average and quesadilla lacked any flavor. Corn chips were overly salty and guac was not fresh. I will try again..."
Baretto Caffe,5,2020-04-09,"Amazing, family-owned caffe. The people, food, drink, ambience are all great!
Prosciutto, veggie and chicken paninis are my favourite lunch at Baretto. 
Order, takeout and enjoy soon!"
Grazie Ristorante,5,2019-12-04,"I've been to Grazie multiple time, and it's definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurant in the area. I always get their pizza (all the ones I tried so far have been very delicious), but my girlfriend likes to get their pasta. 

It's one of our go-to places whenever we're near the area. There are times when they get really busy (usually weekend dinner), so try to make reservations if you can. I believe they take reservations on weekends before 6pm."
Tacos El Asador,1,2020-04-24,"Ordered beef burrito and pork pupusas through ubereats.
Started with the burrito which was bland and barely any beef/protein. I couldn't even finish the burrito because it was so bad and I decided to try the pupusas.
It was hard by the time I got to it. Think twice before ordering..."
Magical Taste of China,2,2020-01-27,"I came here with a group of friends and I have to say I wasn't very impressed.

It took us a long time to even get enough menus that we could share. The menus are confusing as there is a large place-mat like sheet you can use, or the menu book with pictures.

Then they tried to sell us a membership. Really? A membership? When I looked at the menu again there are 2 different prices. The cheaper one is the membership price and is of course brighter and more prominent than the higher non-member price. 

We ordered a variety of items and they were all meh. A few items we had to ask for again as they were forgotten. 

The staff run around yelling at each other and its really annoying and disturbing. 

When we finished and tried to pay, the waiter tried to split our bill and half way through asking each of us what we ordered he gave up and gave it to another server, so we had to start over again.

I wouldn't go again unless I went with someone with one of these fancy memberships."
Grazie Ristorante,3,2019-03-09,"We came to Grazie for dinner on a Friday evening. It was half empty when we came in (around 4:45), but it was packed by 6pm. Honestly, I expected food to be better based on all the reviews, however it wasn't spectacular food! Service was fine (when it wasn't busy), ambience was traditional but very noisy (perhaps because restaurant is small and packed with people). 

I don't know if I'll return to try again as would like to explore other restaurants around."
Sichuan Garden Restaurant,4,2017-09-13,"Still one of my favorite original Chinatown establishments. I love the staff here - all bilingual and super friendly and treats you like family, especially if you speak Mandarin ;) Whenever I get cravings for traditional Chinese vegetarian dishes like lotus root, Chinese mushroom and fungus, mapo tofu, etc I come here. I also come here when I feel ""heritage-sick"" and need to reconnect with people who remind me of my family. Many customers here are regulars and know the staff personally. 

They will make all sorts of accommodations for dietary restrictions or special diets, such as vegan/vegetarian, e.g. mapo tofu usually is made with meat so remember to tell them at the beginning that you are vegetarian. 

Downsides are that they put way too much cornstarch, salt, and MSG in all of the mains. I definitely don't recommend the ""Bamboo shoots with Chinese mushrooms"" dish as everything was literally swimming in a broth of corn starch and the bamboo shoot was a bit stinky (as it should be, but just note that it is an acquired taste). I recommend the mapo tofu - it isn't that spicy at all! Also recommend the mixed vegetable stirfry, which contains Chinese black fungus (so yummy and crunchy!) and lotus root. This one has less corn starch and is on the lighter side.

Prices are low - most dishes are under $10 - and portion sizes are large. Rice/carbs do not come automatically with main dishes, so you do have to order these separately.

They accept card as well as cash.

Will be back!"
House of Gourmet,1,2019-05-27,"This is my first and last time trying this place, here is why:
1. Service: I get it, lots of people come here for food, lineup is long, and not that many waiters, but when I was trying to order food, the server was literally so impatient that he kept tapping his fingers on the table loudly, I spent like 2 minutes thinking and he made me feel like I was wasting his time. This is a big NONO for me.
2. The rice noodle roll around fried dough炸两肠粉: for all the people on yelp who recommended it, I really think u should try more places for this before recommendation. I have never seen people put it in soy sauce, ITS SUPPOSED TO BE CRISPY and u put it in liquid, what is the common sense here? And the bottom layer of it was so soggy I didn't even know what I was eatin, mush or food. Then I took a bite of the top layer rolls which did not touch any of the sauce, the fried dough was so soggy and soft and then I suddenly understood why they had to put sauce on it ---- to cover the fact that they don't even know how to make this dish. DO NOT ORDER.
3. Two meat combo rice - roasted pork and roasted duck. When we asked them about the roasted pork, waiter said ""it's crispy"", it WAS 100% NOT CRISPY. I don't understand how do they expect people to pay for dishes with this low quality, I really don't get it.

I can find at least 3 restaurants which costs much less in Chinatown and still beats this place in every aspects, so if I were u, I would avoid it for life."
Lai Wah Heen,3,2019-07-26,"Came to Lai Wah Heen with my family to try out their peking duck as I had received a coupon for a free order. Growing up in Scarborough and being completely surrounded by Chinese restaurants, and being Chinese myself, I've had my fair share of Chinese cuisine. Upon arrival, I knew right away it would be a different vibe as it was located inside a hotel and everything looked fairly nice. 

The staff was helpful and polite though a bit stiff. Nonetheless our order was accurate and the tea was always filled. We had dinner on a Tuesday night so it wasn't overly busy but there were some larger parties dining.

On to the food: so as I said, I'm Chinese and have grown up around eating this food in and outside of the house. We ordered about 9 dishes for 7 people including peking duck, stir-fried beef flavoured with aged mandarin peel, sweet and sour pork w/ lychee, gailon vegetables, pineapple chicken fried rice, soy sauce fried rice noodle with beef and fried chicken. First impressions, the food looked nice but was pretty small portions and cost a pretty penny more than what you get uptown. Not surprising with this being a downtown hotel restaurant. The taste though was really really good. Everything was delicious and had lots of flavour. Presentation was pretty and at the end we ordered enough to feel full though not without a price. 

Overall, the food was delicious, the service was good but price for the amount of food was just a bit too much for myself. They are other options out there for upscale Chinese food that might possibly be less expensive and closer to my neck of the woods."
Buca Yorkville,2,2019-10-18,"We ordered three pasta dishes all of them were mediocre; lobster, vongole and octopus. Lacking flavor and pasta overcooked. Very skimpy on the seafood. Fail. Never again. Not worth the calories. Very disappointed and I'm a carb/pasta whore."
Magical Taste of China,1,2019-12-15,"Very bad service the servers are so loud and rude .. the food tastes bad and super oily, the chicken is not white meat while they told me it was , the rice had rocks in it that almost broke my tooth and so not clean the whole experience was so bad I wouldn't recommend anyone to go there and on top of that I went back home with food poison and had diarreah .. the worst place ever please watch out"
Lai Wah Heen,5,2018-10-03,"High quality, fancy dining with some of the best dim sum I've had in Toronto. The interior was quite elegant (inside the Double Tree Hotel), service was very attentive, and every single dish was delicious."
La Vecchia Ristorante,2,2019-07-08,It was under cooked noodle and no savory at all in my pasta. Overpriced and it's not worth to paying for it.
Levetto,3,2018-04-15,"This Levetto location is located at Dovercourt and Sudbury, a few minutes away from the busy street of Queen West. I've tried the other Levetto locations before and decided to come back to this particular location as I was in the mood for pasta. I dropped by for lunch on a Thursday; the eatery was quite empty. The pasta I ordered was filing and service was friendly but the food was just forgettable this particular time. I found the pasta to be underwhelming, under seasoned, and overcooked. Unfortunately did not have a good experience here and will not be returning."
House of Gourmet,3,2019-10-11,"Good for assisting in the time of need.....HANGOVERS.

These guys are open and you can order before 4pm unlike some nasty places who don't care about my suffering.

The food is very reasonably priced and pretty good too, a usual is the beef in black bean sauce which is solid and very filling...on the other hand the fried rice dishes are not the greatest and can lack a lot of flavor.

Good place just be sure what your ordering is something powerful in flavor as the more subtle options generally tend to fail."
Fudao noodle house,3,2019-04-13,"Fudao is a standard noodle house that gives really generous portions! 

I was actually expecting it to be more of a dipping noodle situation after seeing the photos but it's actually more of a hot pot since you're supposed to toss in all of the toppings and noodles in your broth immediately before it cools. 

For the price, I think it's a solid spot that will definitely fill you up. The service was just OK. I was surprised that there was a decent amount of seating. If you're visiting, it's not a must but if you're looking for a place to get a substantial amount of food for a good price it's worth trying."
Terroni,1,2020-03-18,"This place is definitely deceiving with all the good reviews. The food is not particularly good and we ordered a great variety of food so we could try a little bit of everything. The service was lacking and the mandatory tip amount is fairly high for big groups which we felt they did not deserve. The free bread they handed out at the beginning was not enough for the amount of people we had. We expected them to give us one per person at least and they did not warn us that we would be charged for it when we asked for more when we realized there was not enough for everyone. When the bills came and we asked about it, the server very rudely said if you just don't want to pay go talk to my manager. A lot of us will never come back to this restaurant."
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine,2,2019-06-24,"We tried this place since it's close to our hotel and shopping places. 
The ambiance was great and place looks clean. But the service needs a lot of work. The hot and sour soup is terribly spicy and no taste. Just the hot spice. So I ordered another soup. The wonton soup. It took them almost 30 minutes to bring my soup out. And likewise no taste and very UN-CHINESE flavor. 
We also asked one waiter about a cocktail mix and he initially gave me the impression that he does not want to be asked about the drinks and the menu. The waiter said I'll get back it's you but he never did come back. Almost All waiters and servers here are very UNFRIENDLY AND NO SMILE at all. Very disappointing place.!!!!"
7 Numbers Restaurant,1,2019-10-25,"Extremely disappointing and mundane. 

Served frozen fish, the lasagna pasta was so overcooked it was actually falling apart and floury. There was not one element of any dishes that I actually enjoyed and while sitting here, I can't wait to leave so I can go to shoppers and get a frozen pizza..."
Baretto Caffe,4,2018-09-12,"Completely hidden from the street as it's located inside a medical building.  Thank you for the Yelper who posted the photo of the actual building!  Otherwise, I would've missed it.  :)

Very, very close to a 5*!  The only reasons why it missed the mark was that the food took sometime after ordering, 20mins+.  And there was a missing ingredient in the Fantasia Salad - corn!  I didn't bother mentioning it 'cause we were soo hungry by the time the food arrived.

If you're looking for a quick meal, this is not the place for you.  Please allow some time to soak in the '80s Italo-Disco music and the owners kind demeanor!

Personally, if it were my first time, I'd order a caffeinated drink (good beans), pasta, pizza, panini, & pastry.  I'd skip the salads.  The Fantasia was good, but it's something that you can make at home.  Latté was smooth and very, very good!

Pasta with rosé sauce was DELICIOUS!  It arrived to the table piping hot and fresh tasting.  If you're not too hungry, it can definitely be shared btw 2 ppl as it also comes with some garlic bread + a side salad.

Owner was very nice, always checking in on us.  She was upbeat and always said, ""with pleasure"" and seemed to mean it!  There were some nice touches like providing us with place mats and glasses of water with ice.  Very warm atmosphere!

Too bad/thank God this place isn't located too close by.  Otherwise, it can be dangerous!"
Nodo Restaurant,3,2018-12-23,"It's ok. It's definitely not 4.5 lol. 

We got the prosciutto and ricotta fritters to start and those were great. Took a little too long to come out but they were redeeming. 

We got the oreciette (sp?) and duck tagliatelle and both fell short in different areas. The duck tagliatelle was definitely missing some flavour notes - probably lacking in aromatics- maybe garlic? Something was missing. The pasta was also way overdone for a restaurant and not al dente at all. It needed a lot more salt- and even though I got piles of parmesan on it, it was still under salted. 

The oreciette to me was the better of the two- the pasta was perfectly al dente and the chilli component made the taste better, but it was still missing something- hard to say what.

The tables adjacent to us seemed to really like their food so maybe it was just us.

We didn't get dessert so I can't speak for that. 

I would maybe come back and try to gnocchi but other than that, nothing really sparked my interest."
Cinco Mexican Restaurant,4,2019-01-20,"Two types of tacos:
Gourmet = two tacos with cheese in middle with loads of stuff inside. About $8 each. I'd say they are better and more complex than the latter, but at $8 is a bit steep.

Street: More simple one tortilla tacos. Still really good and about $4 each.

I'd say in general the tacos are really good. 

The service is quick, though when we were there, there was only one other person so the chef made ours immediately.

The complimentary chips were made on the spot, I saw her frying them while we were there in preparation. Though if you ask for more, it is another $1.50.

The sauces, and get yourself were delicious. I really liked they Mexican mud and the green one, forgot the name."
Enoteca Sociale,2,2019-07-27,I came here and had a short male server with a buzz cut and glasses that was very rude.
Carisma,4,2019-01-09,"I booked a table at Carisma for NYE for a few reasons. First, I wanted something relatively low key since we had to head to the airport early the next morning. Second, I liked that they had their regular menu going on NYE and we weren't going to get a prix fixe meal; I find holiday ones like NYE and Valentine's Day usually disappoint. Third, it was walkable from our hotel, so we didn't have to contend with surge pricing or getting a ride (not sure how hard that is in Toronto, but it's a mess at home).

I'm not sure when the restaurant moved, the interior looks quite different from the pictures I saw in reviews. White tables, teal, velvet seating left it feeling much brighter that the old space. The acoustics aren't great, it was quite loud in the place which detracted from the romantic vibe they seemed to be trying to create.

We started out with cocktails and the burratina appetizer. He got a manhattan and I got an aperol spritz. They split the appetizer for us, which was very nice. The appetizer itself was good, but not outstanding. We had planned to each order an appetizer portion of pasta and a secondi, but our server felt that might be too much food. Instead, we opted to split the gnocchi as our primi, which again came split for us. It was creamy and rich and the gnocchi delicate, but I felt that it would have benefited from a but more salt. For my main, I got the sea bass and boyfriend got the filet. We also split a bottle of valpolicello. My sea bass came over veggies and potatoes and was quite delicious - my favorite of all the things I ate. Boyfriend like his dish, but felt like it had a bit too much char on it. 

For dessert, we had a glass of dessert wine and split the walnut tart. Both were quite good and to cap off a very filling meal, we had a glass of champagne at midnight with those that stuck around to ring in the New Year.

Service was attentive and knowledgeable. My only knock is that the pacing at the beginning of the meal was quite fast. We had barely finished the last bite of burratina when our gnocchi arrived.

Overall, I got what I wanted; a nice low key NYE and a good meal."
Cinco Mexican Restaurant,4,2020-02-03,"I absolutely love little unassuming places like cinco. A great addition to the neighbourhood and a little walk from high park. You know this is a great  place when the food is affordable, tasty and authentic! I love the hot sauce choices. The coziness is real here. The only thing is because it is small, it does fill up fast. I highly recommend if your in and around the Roncesvalles neighbourhood! I throughly enjoyed  the carnita and fish tacos I had! Happy eating!"
Lai Wah Heen,2,2019-05-07,"We came here for Peking Duck around late lunch time and ended up getting dim sum.

Steamed barbecue pork bun: yes! Get this! Flavorful and light. I also enjoyed the pork shrimp and scallop siu mai.

Average items: deep fried mini shrimp ball

Things I didn't care for: deep fried dumpling of Berkshire pork and baby shrimp (tasted like a sesame ball with a filling), baked mini egg tart, steamed soft bun filled with custard, tapioca lychee and mango in chilled sweet soup

DO NOT GET: steamed short spare rib in garlic and toasted garlic. This dish was horrendous! It was slimy!

We weren't too impressed so we left to have another meal around the corner."
Hotopia Downtown,1,2019-08-23,Horrible service. I used Yelp waitlist feature and arrived on time. We stood by the door for 20 minutes and nobody bothered to check on us. All the servers were chatting amongst themselves. No single exchange of words at all with their customers.
KINKA IZAKAYA ORIGINAL,3,2020-03-12,"One of the oldest restaurants that I had been to. Since North York. It's always been a great experience with them! No matter was the lunch hours having great lunch sets and yummy fish; but also the dinner are always pretty impressive. The late snacks are pretty good too! 
Don't forget to try their cocktails if you drink! 
Overall a pretty good experience there although sometimes is too noisy to talk with frds"
Harmoney Chinese Restaurant,3,2018-07-10,"[FOOD] - 3.5/5
I was highly anticipating my lunch here since I rarely find authentic Xian restaurants (Northwestern Chinese cuisine) in Toronto. I ordered Xian dishes such as the Steamed Lamb Pita Soup, the Chinese burger (Stuffed Pita), and the Northwestern Cold Noodles. My favourite item was the pita soup. The broth was just rich and flavourful... it would go great on a cold winter day. The cold noodles were a super refreshing part of the meal. Lastly, the Chinese burger (with lamb filling) was pretty good as well. The outer bun was crispy, not too thick, and quite delicious. 

[SERVICE] - 4/5
Okay, so I only gave 4/5 because my boyfriend speaks Chinese and the lady also speaks Chinese. She was quite nice and accommodating. It would've been nice if they had more than one server and spoke English. My boyfriend had to translate for the table of 14 next to us who could hardly understand the server. 

[OVERALL] - 3/5
While the restaurant can seem demeaning and unfriendly to non-Chinese speakers, it is a great place to go for highly authentic Xian cuisine."
El Catrin Destileria,3,2019-10-19,"Would give the drinks a 4/5. Extremely slow wait (~14 minutes to get our drinks). Also asked to remove agave from one of our drinks and the waiter did not communicate that properly to his bar tender - so we got stuck with agave in one of our drinks even though we asked to remove it. 

Not worth the wait. Take your business elsewhere. Did not try the food so I can't give any insight to that."
Mariachi’s Restaurant,3,2019-06-06,"So this is my first trip to Canada and I decided to try this place because of a picture I saw of a margarita. So of course,  I did go and order that drink. I asked for a frozen margarita but it was far from frozen. It looked like the machine had melted. They made me another and it looked great but it wasn't sweet. 

I did order the quesadilla with chorizo. It was delicious. They served it Spanish rice and a side salad. First time I've been to a Mexican restaurant and I didn't get black beans. I had the habanero sauce with it and it was super spicy but I live for spicy food!"
Eataly,4,2020-01-05,"This is such a cool place to visit - whether you're here as a tourist, for groceries, or to grab a bite - Eataly is a vibrant spot for high quality Italian goods. 

I came here just to check out what they had to offer and ordered some small treats and a few bottles of milk to go. 

This place is very packed on weekends, so plan accordingly. They have everything from fresh pastas, to different varieties of cheese, pizza, and desserts. I bought a bottle of whole milk and egg nog (about $5 each for 1L). 

I ordered a cannoli that was freshly made and was quite satisfied!"
Jacobs & Co. Steakhouse,4,2019-02-17,"Finally had the opportunity to come here after hearing all the great things about this place. Very upscale and posh vibe. 

Servers were descriptive with the menu and was very at tentative. Made great recommendations.

Oysters tasted fresh. Table side Cesar salad was great. Ribeye was well cooked but still tough and chewy. Wasn't particularly well seasoned which is why the side salt and sauces were provided. Could have lived without the rapini and mushroom. Bone marrow is a must. 

Independently a very great experience but tainted from just coming back from Japan."
Khao San Road,3,2019-06-09,"Hits and misses at one of the most popular Thai spots in the GTA. It's legacy will be for ushering in an era of outstanding and competitive Thai cuisine to Toronto... But as it currently stands, it's good but not worth the long waits.

What We Got: Pad Kee Mao (chicken), Chef Top's Massaman Curry (Tofu), Green Curry (chicken), Thai Iced Tea

What We Liked: 
+curry was smooth and solid kick
+Pad Kee Mao was a big standout - definitely one of my favourite dishes ($17)
+Chicken didn't cost extra but beef did 

What We Didn't: 
-Thai Iced Tea was smooth but missing a ""tea"" flavour, especially as the ice slowly melted. 
-Chef's curry is quite sweet - would recommend only to those who want to mix a sweet tooth with an entree. Also very heavy with plenty of potatoes
-very noisy! Hard to have conversation and hear yourself
-spice levels seemed a bit off. I swear the Pad Kee Mao at level 3 seemed to be more mild than the curry at Level 2. Felt like it was the other way around!


What We Recommend
/Pad Kee Mao! Probably will try level 4 spicy next time, but I might stick with 3 just to doubly confirm next time

Next Time...
Will probably try Pad Thai, Khao Soi and some appetizers. But let's be grateful for all these outstanding Thai options nowadays.


3.5, but I'll wait to round up based on subsequent visits!"
Mexico Lindo,3,2017-06-18,"We came here for Father's Day dinner on a slow Sunday. On google, it said the restaurant was closed on Sunday but apparently not ( they are open until 9pm), however when we called for a reservation they said they don't take reservation on Friday, Saturday and Sunday and that they were open till 8 pm. 

Restaurant was almost empty and after eating the food here we understand why. Service was okay, food was so-so! Nothing extraordinary that I can talk about nor I would return for."
Como En Casa,3,2019-07-07,"Rating: 3/5

Summary: 
We believe this restaurant is worth a visit if in the area. We have frequented this place multiple times and there is a reason we keep coming back. The service is extremely friendly and the atmosphere, though tight, is rather warm and welcoming. However, one must be careful when picking their dish because while some taste wonderfully flavorful, others are somewhat disappointing.

The dishes we tried: 
- burrito w/ verde sauce
- fish tacos
- chicken enchiladas
- chicken mole
- guac/salsa w/ chips
- mains circa $12-15
- appetizers circa $6-8

Food:
One of our favorite dishes is the Burrito with Verde Sauce. It's a big hot burrito packed with many flavors. What makes it special, however, is the verde sauce that complements the burrito very well. The verde sauce is a tangy and spicy sauce that consists of tomatillos, jalapenos, and lime. You probably won't get burritos smothered with a delicious sauce at other places where you'd think of getting a burrito (Chipotle, etc.). We'd also point out that the Guacamole tastes extremely fresh with a great rich and creamy feel. The chunky and spicy salsa is also great. The two dipping sauces pair well with the tortilla chips and is worth considering if looking for an appetizer.

However, we were disappointed with some of the dishes we ordered. For example, the enchiladas and chicken mole did not satisfy at all. As for the enchiladas, the ones we had were filled with extremely dry chicken and the wrap itself was also unappetizing.

On a positive note, the service is remarkable. The owner once even gave us a free refill for our horchata (a most delightful sweet drink consisting of rice, vanilla, and cinnamon). The servers are very kind and patient, thus contributing to a better dining experience.

Conclusion: 
Google reviews rates this as a 4.5/5. We give it a 3/5. It's worth a visit if in the area, but there are only certain dishes worth eating. We recommend the chicken or burrito with verde sauce and the horchata.

Itacate,3,2018-10-18,"Were the tacos good? Definitely. Pescado, beef and pork with pineapple, all solid choices with two homemade tortillas each. 

The people were pleasant, though not overly friendly. 

Its cash only, that in my book makes things difficult. 

The wait is long, I had to wait (I was told) 25-30 mins for three tacos. To me they just need to sort out their process to get through orders faster. I understand you have one big order before me and you want to be authentic, but there must be efficiencies.

Maybe if you offered like chips while I wait it would smooth things out for me.

It's delicious and authentic like I said, but not sure I'd wait another 30 mins for tacos."
Itacate,4,2018-08-28,"I ordered suadero (beef) tacos. I didn't have high expectations because I've eaten real tacos in Mexico City and it's hard to match that authentic taste.
These tacos were loaded with beef. Very filling. I was worried that I'd still be hungry, but they use the large tortillas and they were loaded. 
I'm happy to say that they were quite delicious. Even my wife who is Mexican really enjoyed the food here. And she's hard to please when it comes to Mexican food. 
I had one of my wife's al pastor tacos and it was soooo flavourful. I highly recommend this one as well. 
The hot sauce was nice and hot too if you like your food spicy. 
My only knock, was that the service was a bit slow. Other then that, this place is the real deal."
La Chingada,5,2019-03-29,Stopped by for a quick late night snack after a meal that left me hungry.  It was a Wednesday night and the place still had some tables free.  I went for the special of a chorizo taco and Sol beer for 10 dollars.  Not bad.  I added a grilled fish taco.  I have to say it is rare to get a grilled not fired piece of fish.  It was outstanding.  The chorizo was very good too.  I have to also comment on the shell.  It was one of the better corn tortillas I have ever had.  I will be back to try more.
Hong Kong Bistro Cafe,4,2018-08-13,"I was so worried this restaurant would be packed when I walked in on Saturday afternoon with a party of 8.  Thank god it was only half full.

The restaurant is on a 2nd level and somewhat small but not too crowded.  
The menu is extensive and you can get pretty much everything that's available in Markham.

I got:
1. Grilled chicken with spaghetti in black peppercorn sauce
- This was delicious.  The pasta was soft without being soggy and I think they melted a little of butter into it - yum.  
- The chicken was a good size and cooked perfectly.  
- The sauce complemented the whole dish, I would definitely reorder.
2. The beef skewers were great. But for $8 it was hefty for 4 skewers. We also found a small fly in our fruit salad. The waiter took off my lemonade ice tea to placate us and gave us another small bowl of fruit salad.  
3. Chicken fried rice. I shuddered a little when my boyfriend ordered this but it turned out very well overall.  The rice wasn't soaked in soy sauce and tasted like your usual chow fan with nice big chunks of chicken and eggs.

Overall this is a pretty good place to hit up if you're craving HK style food.

Service is Chinese (ie. not friendly but very efficient).
Tip: Waiter here speaks both Cantonese and English fluently (huge plus for anybody that's afraid of a language barrier)."
Homemade Ramen,3,2019-03-15,"I guess I'm becoming more health-conscious, but after loading up on carbohydrates in the form of noodles, I didn't feel great afterwards. The noodles themselves are a step above your ordinary noodles, I have to admit. They do a good job in the noddles department, but I couldn't shake off the feeling that I ate something that wasn't beneficial for my health or my body. That place was packed on a Friday evening, so I'm guessing it's pretty popular and has a loyal clientele. Despite good service, I probably won't be coming back as my diet and food preferences are slowly shifting toward healthy & nutritious food that good for my body. Everyone has to make their own choice. After all, you are what you eat. Food is medicine if you eat the right food."
Homemade Ramen,2,2019-09-28,This was just okay for me. There are so many hand pulled noodle places in Toronto now that I'm not sure this really stands out. They have generous noodle portions but not so many veggies. Meat was all right. I think my big mistake was getting the chicken wings which turned out being tasteless and with breading similar but (not as flavorful) as KFC. Oh well. On to the next place.
Campechano Taquería,4,2019-06-26,"A great spot for some tacos!

Been meaning to go here for a while and after 1hr in Costco followed by the lovely prime time traffic back to King West it was time!!

Firstly, defo aim to go when its sunny and sit outside, the outdoor area is nice and if you can get in the little secluded section you may never leave.

On the tacos i had the Haddock Fish Taco, the Steak and Chorizo and the Chicken ones - I warn now do not be as greedy as me 3 of these tacos was too much of course i ate them but 2 is well enough.

The fish one was only ok but the Steak Taco was one of the best I have had...the chicken also is a treat so go for them 2.

All the ingredients felt fresh and each taco came with different toppings to compliment the meats which which they did perfectly!

Absolutely worth a go if your a taco fan, just don't be surprised when you accidentally spend over 100$

PS - The cocktails are unique and amazing, the Pina-Mojito is a must try ...hmmm maybe this is why i cleared 100$

PPS - Get chips and Guac, its good and free refills on the chips."
Ristorante Sotto Sotto,2,2018-12-05,"Sotto Sotto has been on my list for a long time and I was happy to be able to dine there recently.

The waiter kept asking us repeatedly if we want sparkling water and we had to tell him at least 3-4 times that we don't. Finally we got our actual drinks and wanted to place the food order. For some reason, the waiter stopped coming to our table. We witnessed other tables order and eat their appetizers and order and get their entrees while we got no service. Finally after being in the restaurant for over 30 minutes (and not placed an order yet) my wife had enough and left the table to find the manager. During this time, the waiter came to our table and said ""I saw you were talking, I didn't want to interrupt you"" which is a rather odd excuse - were we supposed to sit in silence to get serviced?

My wife returned with the manager who was a class act and we got assigned another waiter who was attentive and fantastic for the rest of the night. We decided to share the risotto. I'm not claiming to be expert in Italian food despite being in Italy for over 10 times, but the rice was simply too hard. I'm aware of the fact that you're not supposed to overcook it to a point where it's mushy but too hard is too hard. I was hoping to eat Italian food that's spectacular but it was actually below average and very pricey."
Campechano Taquería,3,2018-06-04,"Great tacos with a good spice level! The food at Campechano is tapas style and they have a wide range of tacos. 

The guacamole is served with a side of spiced nachos - they were a little dry and stale, but the guacamole was fresh. The ceviche is an European bass, with a nice kick of spice as well. I ordered the fish taco which was freshly deep fried and simply delicious. 

The restaurant has a patio with outdoor seating, as well as bench like seating for larger groups. Unfortunately, the service is not as great as the food thus meriting a 3 star."
La Carnita,3,2019-01-28,"Stopped here for an after dinner snack and ended up sharing and app and a couple tacos with friends. Not much to say since we were here for a short time, but the food was definitely tasty!"
La Carnita,1,2020-02-16,"Worst service ever.  Staff don't care about the guests.  No table check. We had to hunt down a server to get a drink and order food. 

Cool vibe but would not recommend"
Chula Taberna Mexicana,2,2018-12-23,"I came last summer and had an amazing dinner, I remembered the tacos to be rich in flavour and super affordable which was a big stand out to me since a lot of other taco places that charge upwards of $7/8 per taco. I dare to say that this WAS my favourite taco place at the time.

I came back this month for the first time in nearly a year and things were a lot different. For Tacos, I ordered the Biztec de Carne and the Carnita and they ended up tasting exactly the same, which was disappointing and weird since they have a lot of different ingredients altogether. Also there seemed to be a lot of liquid in the taco filling because halfway through eating one of my tacos it fell apart due to the moisture. Also, in all of the tacos, there seemed to be this weird crunchy/salty/sweet ingredient that I couldn't tell what it was. It was really odd, and gave the tacos a weird flavour/texture profile. This was not the same as what I ate a year ago, and they seemed to be more expensive than I remembered.

The one thing that stayed consistent however was their amazing Churro Sundae - everyone in the restaurant seemed to be ordering this. Their Churros were seasoned and cooked perfectly, and the caramel ice cream pairs perfectly - its one of the best churro desserts in the city in my opinion, and would come back just for this."
Stelvio,3,2018-09-26,"This small restaurant isn't a place I would have chosen myself but was suggested to me by a local Torontonian. Stelvio has a location in Toronto as well as in Milan, so my expectations were set really high. The service was great but honestly the food didn't meet my expectations. 
Being a vegetarian my options were limited, so I went with the mushroom risotto. By the time it got to my table it was cold, likely because of the way they plate it; a thin layer of risotto in a large bowl, almost looks like a porridge. 
My colleagues went with the prosciutto and beef wrapped around a thick wooden dowel, which came with polenta fries and looked rather unique, they seemed to enjoy it. 
Wines are all on the pricey side... amarone starts at $185...
All in all I was expecting more."
Fudao noodle house,4,2018-11-11,"What I got: Original Rice Noodle ($8.49) and Pickled Cabbage Soup ($9.99)

Pros:
- Came here on a very rainy day and was able to get seats despite this place being pretty busy on a weeknight. 
- The soups here are supposedly made with no MSG, so you won't have to feel guilty about drinking it.
- Lunch menu is quite worth it, for ~$10 you can get soup noodles, with appetizer and drink. 
- Free refills on the noodles but not on the seafood/meat/veg you put in the soup. 
- Overall a great place for cheap eats with a nice selection of little items you can put into the soup.
- I'd recommend you to put everything in while the soup was still boiling to avoid eating raw seafood.

Cons:
- Take debit and cash only
- The seating arrangement can be a bit tight so you can hear the conversation of the people next to you.
- The Pickled Cabbage soup was on the saltier side, so I would recommend the thai or original one more."
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,4,2020-05-26,"I give this restaurant four stars. I have eaten food at Pai twice, most recently in late November 2019.

Pai is a trendy Thai restaurant located in downtown Toronto. It is one of the most popular spots in the city so you need to make a reservation in advance. It is busy and loud, and constantly has hip hop and pop music playing in the background. The majority of the guests are millennials so it might not be the best place for everyone.

The food is very good and very filling. I always order too much which is okay as the leftovers (excluding anything crispy) tend to travel well. There are a lot of menu options and you can't really go wrong with anything.

Highly recommended. I will be back soon. Four stars."
El Charro,1,2019-11-26,Can't comment on the food as I NEVER GOT MY ORDER. I ordered a shrimp burrito and waited 30 minutes. I had an appointment so I couldn't wait anymore; I asked the cashier if my order was almost ready and after looking through a pile of past orders I saw him throw the shrimp on the grill. I asked them to forget about it as really had to go. They reimbursed me cash and I left annoyed that I never ate my food and was starving. I'm not sure how they somehow forgot about my order when I was sitting right there in front of them waiting for 30 minutes! I don't think I'll give it another shot...
Como En Casa,2,2019-07-05,"Based on the ratings and reviews I was very excited to check this place out. I ordered a ""large chicken burrito"" which cost 14$. I got a really authentic vibe when I walked in. However, the burrito was one of the cheapest ones I've ever eaten. I asked for guacamole.... no guacamole. It was majority lettuce, rice, and bread from the overlapped wrap. Had to search just to find any chicken, very minimal. It was very dry, barely any sauce. Cheese was not good quality. All flavours were very bland. Extremely disappointing, for $14 I expect at minimum good size/quantity but didn't even get that."
Zhang’s Kitchen,3,2019-12-24,"Service is very good...friendly ambiance but I'm sorry, I just did not taste the authentic chinese food that I want.  Maybe they are just giving a modern twist but not for me.  Also, the meat are so thinly sliced for the price it should have more than that.  It just my taste and maybe some people will not agree."
Asian Legend,4,2018-09-25,"Been to other locations and this one was good for service and being in the heart of Chinatown..we see seeking solace in a familiar menu.

food was tasty but a little heavy with the white pepper with the beef and egg white soup dish.  dishes came out quickly and were large and shareable as always.

snowpea leaves were very tender and young..not woody at all.
pricey for Chinese food in Chinatown but well worth it.

not stroller friendly but thankfully good Samaritans came to the rescue!"
Terroni,3,2020-01-27,"For so many years, I have never visit Terroni.  Actually after dinner tonight I don't think there's an urgent need as everything was normal and on the pricey side.

Was looking at the mushroom pasta special for Monday and the cost was  31.  I asked the waiter what's the portion sIze and he told me 5 pieces.....really?!

OK I went with the grilled calamari for $18 and a side of rapini for $10 instead.  Well, the calamari was alright, I like the tomato arugula salad a lot underneath but the rapini wasn't good as it was super hard to chew.

My friends had the $170 steak combo which came with a salad and a plate of veggies and it tasted good.

So my verdict is 2.5 stars  round up to 3 here we don't have half star option for review.  Prob won't be back tbh."
Wilbur Mexicana,4,2020-04-27,"Nice little spot for a casual lunch with friends! Lots of different options for tacos, and the ones I tried were delicious!"
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine,3,2019-03-02,"Food was tasty.

Eyelash found in tripe dish.

Guy tried to give us leftovers.

Prices are not available unless you ask. FYI here are the prices."
King’s Tacos,5,2019-08-03,Portion sizes are huge. We've shared one taco dish between two people. Service is always friendly. Free fresh chips and dipping sauces. Very authentic and delicious!
GB Hand-pulled Noodles,3,2019-04-07,"Cheap and delicious, two of my favourite words, accurately describe GB Hand-Pulled Noodles.

As is typically the case, places like this come with its sacrifices. For starters, there was a line out the door when I strolled in one Saturday for lunch with friends. 

We were eventually seated, though I found the tables quite packed together - they really maximized the space....to the detriment of comfort. 

The food makes up for it - I tried the thick beef noodles and they were some of the best I've had. Plus, you can even see your noodles getting pulled and freshly cooked.

But, before you're even finished your delicious bowl, you'll find waiters beginning to clean your table and dropping you the bill - you'll definitely feel rushed when eating here."
Ho Ho Barbeque,3,2019-08-20,"Found this on Yelp and picked it cause it had a higher rating than the other shops all lined up serving the same thing!

There were only a few people in line for Ho Ho, but there was a line out the door a few shops down. Probably should've gone to the other place, but this one was ok.

Pork was ok. The skin was still crispy when we got back to the hotel. Duck wasn't anything special. Cha siu was ok. This w all about average for us, although I know our moms would say it wasn't good.

Next time, I'll have to try the other place with the longer line."
Terroni,2,2019-12-12,"Very spacious restaurant, a bonus for downtown foodies. 
The location used to be a bank, so the architecture inside is unique, interesting, and stunning.
(Be sure to visit washrooms and vaults in the bsmt.) 

The menu is not typical Italian, which was a bit disappointing for my group of 7, and they're not open to substitutions for dietary / halal purposes. 

Our server was very insistent about what we should and shouldn't apply cheese to, a quick suggestion would've been nice - but then let ppl eat how they want to!

Food was a bit bland, although their tomato sauce tastes fresh and authentic. The fresh cut hot peppers they bring to the table saved our meals. 
*Be prepared to cut the uncooked basil on the Margherita pizza yourself ‍ it's just placed uncooked in the center.  

Desserts are a different story, very nice presentation and the taste was even better! The Tiramisu & Creme Caramel were a nice end to a mehh unexciting lunch. 

Not a lot of veggie/salad/vegan options for those who have medical / religious restrictions. 
But if you're into fusion menus and meat in everything  - this is definitely a great place to go for that."
Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant,5,2019-09-21,"This is a restaurant meant for dining in large groups. The food is delicious and good quality seafood, with large quantities, depending on the option you choose. One thing to keep in mind is that the menu options are a bit on the higher budget scale, but the portions are quite good. The highlight dishes are the lobster tower, crab tower, and deep fried oysters.

Make sure to call in advance and reserve a table."
Blooming Orchid,1,2019-11-01,"NEVER ORDER FROM THIS RESTAURANT! We order from them at least 10 times a week, from our staff to our agents. And today they showed us how POOR their customer service is. We got food poisoning from their food and one of their employees called us disrespectful names. When we walked over to talk to the manager, one of their employees lied and said he was the manager AND the owner - told us he doesn't believe us and that we don't ever have to order from them again because our money doesn't keep their business open. THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! Save your money and order from a place you would feel valued as a loyal customer instead!"
La Chingada,3,2019-05-21,"I think this is between a 3 and a 4.  I enjoyed the tacos,   the chicken one was really very tasty.  But what a mess to eat,  the wrap was very soft and fell apart but it all had a wonderful taste,   lots of flavours.

I had the melted cheese starter with chorizo,  it was ok.  I personally don't like the corn wrap they make here.   They are thick and heavy and really doesn't add anything to the cheese dip.    We had the chips and dip to start with.   There was were some very nice dips here from chillies and guacamole too.   The chips are quite salty though, be warned.   We also had a tasty citrus drink,  grapefruit based,  this was very nice,  we both enjoyed this.   We ended with the churros which were very nice.  Sweet cinammon sugar on top,   very yummy. 

On the whole it was good and alright mixed together.   But also isn't cheap.   I think it cost us $70 for food and two sodas,"
7 Numbers Restaurant,1,2017-07-08,"We came to this place attracted by BlogTO's boast of the best lasagna in town. What's a better way to try the place then the Family Meal it has on the menu. For a set price you get to try a little bit of all their well known food.

It comes with appetizers, salads, pasta, and a main course to share.  With all the rave reviews, we thought we were going to have the best meal of our lives.

To note: Their Lasagna was pretty good. It comes in the menu as a small for just under $10 or a bigger pasta size.  I will return just for that.

Everything else, my companion and I were pretty disappointed.  Granted, it should be pretty hard to screw up a salad. Most is just compilation of freshly chopped up raw ingredients.  One of the salads was dressed REALLY sour.  I ended up taking it home and tossing it with more raw vegetables to be palatable.

The pasta sampler plate they provided came with 3 pasta of their choices - this included the legendary lasagna.  It was the ONLY good thing on the plate. One of the pasta was undercooked so it was still crunchy. We had to send it back to be more ""al dente.""

The only control of choice you have was the main dish. We were able to each choose 2 mains individually -  a pork chop and a lamb shank.  That being the highlight of the meal, we were both pretty disappointed too.  The pork chop was way overcook and tough. The lamb shank - well...we had better elsewhere.

We expected a lot more going into the restaurant especially paying over $100 including wine. We both agree afterwards we should had just gotten a lasagna and that's it.

This place was not horrendous but I would not go out of my way to return."
Swatow Restaurant,5,2019-12-28,"Stopped by this restaurant with my parents for nostalgic reasons. They both raved about it being the best place for noodles since they were in high school. They said it's one of the few places that had authentic Shantou noodles. So we tried the noodles with fish slices, fish balls, and beef brisket. The noodles instantly reminded me of the ones I had in Chiuchow and Shantou, which I still dream about. The broth was light, the noodles were cooked firm, and the fish balls were flavourful. The beef brisket was tender and juicy. Although these noodles can't exactly replicate my experience back in China, it did hit the mark! After finishing our noodle bowls, we also took out some fish balls to cook at home. It was such a satisfying and comforting meal. Looking forward to coming back for more noodles!"
Yummy Yummy Dumplings,3,2019-10-22,Apparently closed today Tuesday Oct 22 at 5pm. Sign says closed Wednesday so I'm not sure what's going on
Nodo Restaurant,3,2020-02-16,"Atmosphere in this restaurant was nice food was delicious but I can't tell you how cheap they are on their drinks
Tall skinny Glass half filled with ice maybe a quarter of a can of pop/coke you're getting $2.30 per serving it left such a bad taste in my mouth I felt ripped off really think about it your customers are paying $23 for a plate of pasta and you can't provide them a full can or a decent portion of your fountain drink really really cheap and I've never seen anything like it in all of my travels so for that is why I'm leaving a three star"
Artisan Plus,4,2020-01-09,"Pros:
Well done hand pulled noodles
Nice variety on menu

Cons:
Seating is tight

Artisan has been in the North York area for quite a while.  This place is there venture into the downtown core.  This much larger location is welcome addition to the downtown area.  Fans of hand pulled noodles should give this place a try.

As I mentioned earlier, this location is much larger than it's North York counterpart.  However, being downtown, it is subject to some limitations as well.  As with many downtown restaurant locations, I feel the seating is tight.  It's a veritable obstacle course when the place is full and everyone has their stuff with them.  The seats here are all of the stool variety as well.  There's a little slot for some space to put your things.  But with most people, you will not have anything to hang your jackets, bags etc on which means you probably place it nearby on the floor which adds to the obstacle course.

I was actually impressed by the menu here.  They have a good assortment of noodles to choose from here.  Some of them seem like original creations that you can't just find anywhere else.  I settled on the classic braised beef noodle and my wife got the clam mashi.  

As you can see from my pics, the presentation on their dishes here are spot on.  Every dish that came out from the kitchen looked very good.  I have to be honest, when my bowl of noodles came out I thought I was going to have to eat something else after.  The bowl was on the smaller side for beef noodles.  However, they do pack a good amount of noodles in there. It should be more than enough for normal appetites.  Big eaters like I am should definitely consider the extra noodle options.

Taste wise, the beef noodle was on point.  The broth was nice and not overly salty.  Noodles were pretty good with some bite.  They weren't the best noodles I've ever had, but they were very good in their own way.  The beef was tender and at least stewed for quite a bit before being served.  All in all, great bowl of noodles.  My wife's dish felt more like an Italian pasta dish.  If it wasn't for the spiciness and the wood ear mushrooms, you could easily serve it at an Italian restaurant and nobody would bat en eye.  Even the noodles looked like gnocchi!

Service was great overall during our visit.  A little disappointment that they only accept cash and debit.  Overall, this is a great little place to try our if you're a fan of hand pulled noodles.  There definitely some of other dishes I saw that I would like to try next time I'm here."
MEXITACO,2,2019-07-22,"This was the worst $32 I ever spent ... 
soggy & flavourless. Was very excited to try this place but I don't think I will be returning or ordering again in the future. Disappointed :("
El Trompo Taco Bar,3,2019-05-26,"2.5 stars but rounds up to 3. Okay tacos but nothing special. Al pastor was dry and lacked flavor.  Service was friendly and very quick (tacos came in less than 3 minutes after ordering).  Frozen margs we're good, though. 

Tinga Tacos: 3/5
Al Pastor Tacos: 2/5
Mango Margarita: 4/5"
Hacienda las Américas,3,2020-02-23,"3.5/5 
The food is alright and authentic, prices are reasonable for the area and the service is friendly. The guacamole is made fresh to order so that's always a plus! I ordered 3 different taco flavours (steak, pork and fish) and preferred the steak fajitas tacos the best as it was super juicy. Wish there was some type of small side that accompanied the meal."
Ha Gow Dim Sum House,1,2019-03-03,"Went today with my boyfriend to try the dim sum over the weekend and was disappointed. Got there at 1:30 PM and ordered about four or five different dim sum's and was told to wait while it was being made. 

The order was for take out. Waited for an hour and a bit and still no end in sight of when I would get my order. I must've seen five Uber eats pick up their orders way after me and there were two or three people behind the line that got seated for dine in, and got served their food before me getting my order. 

After waiting patiently for an hour for my take out order to be completed I went up to the cashier and told them to cancel our order since it wasn't even made at that point. All they said was that they were really backed up. I spoke to both workers and said this isn't right that you guys didn't tell us we have to wait A whole hour for take out. We have been standing at the restaurant at the lineup for a whole hour and still our order was not made at that point in time. Poor Organization."
Dimmi Bar & Trattoria,3,2019-12-10,Came here for lunch with group of friends. Service was good and attentive. Food portion is small for the price. Finished the spaghetti meatballs and was still hungry. Probably will not come back.
La Vecchia Ristorante,1,2017-02-04,"I live in the Yonge/ Egg area and always heard this was supposed to be the best place on Yonge for food as the neighbourhood is quite lacking in the food area to begin with. 

I had high hopes for this restaurant but was gravely disappointed with the service and the food. The flavours they have are all wrong. Most of the food was very pungent and did not have a smooth flow of flavours. It was rather sour the risotto we ordered. We also ordered prawns and the sauces they chose were sour and pungent with too much salt. ( it's all in the sauce for Italian dishes). 

The Gnocchi was okay, it tasted like the Costco brand in a cream sauce ( who could mess up a cream sauce tbh) anyhow I am very disappointed. I did not find the food appetizing at all. The flavours were all mixed up and not great on the palette. 

My waiter unfortunately was very short tempered and seemed agitated the whole time whilst serving my family and I. Whenever we did need something he was never available and would rush off before we finished speaking with him. 

Anyway sad to have to review it like this but that is truly my opinion. 

No match to Campagnolo on Dundas or Buca"
Mariachi’s Restaurant,5,2020-05-08,"been there a couple times just before the lockdown 
staff great 
food fresh and hot .....lots of fun and it doesn't break the bank!!"
Yummy Yummy Dumplings,3,2019-04-19,"Well, this was a good place to me after the owner said I have to pay 10% tip? 

This is not a full service restaurant, I actually had to go to the cashier to pay my bill so I wouldn't understand why I have to pay 10%?

My bill was 37.32 and I have her $40，and I asked her kept the changes and she said it's not enough? 
It's totally ridiculous! I wouldn't care if the food good or not. It's really pricey as well."
Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant,3,2020-01-13,"Stepped into the restaurant and was surrounded by endless tanks of freakishly large crabs. We got the Hong Kong style lobster (4.83 lbs) lunch set that included soup, fried rice, snow pea with goji berries, and dessert. It was nice that we got a bunch of different dishes to try. We also had a lot of food at the end to take home too

Honestly though I started to get sick of the lobster after a few bites since it is fried and quite oily. I ended up eating the veggies/fried rice instead! I also find I prefer lobster fried with ginger and scallion more than HK style. Service was incredibly slow when we went.

Overall I think it was good to try, but I don't know if I would return again. I think it'd be good for special occasions or to treat people that like seafood due to the visual wow factor of the dish though!"
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos,4,2019-09-25,"4 stars for taste
2 stars for price 
Which really should be a 3, but the meat is just so delicious. Coming from LA, I just don't think I can justify 6 CAD for ONE taco and one alone!! If you expect to be full, get ready to spend 20 CAD per person (and really that's like 3 tacos plus tax). 

With price aside, the taste is absolutely delicious. I tried the Pollo Asado and Carnitas- the chicken taco was so tender and the dressing was creamy, dressed with carrots. The carnitas was more no frills - meat with a salsa. 

There's a salsa bar on the side and limited seating, one bench table and the rest is counter space along the window."
Gusto 101,3,2019-08-27,"I ordered a cappuccino with lenticchie while my friend ordered the mushroom bruschetta and panna cotta. I sampled her food as well so I will share my thoughts.

Cappuccino was okay. It was a nice and quick pick me up after work. Lenticchie was average.The lentils were flavoured with crispy salami, pachino tomatoes and zucchini. I couldn't taste the zucchini but the rest was nicely flavoured.

Mushroom bruschetta and panna cotta was Michu better in comparison. Mushroom bruschetta was nice and crunchy. The mushrooms were flavoured nicely and brought out a lot of its natural flavours. The panna cotta has a citrusy taste and a really great summer treat!

Servers were quick to refill waters and to check if we were doing okay. Price point is fairly high for what we ordered but will come back to try the pasta."
Yummy Yummy Dumplings,3,2019-09-22,"Cute family run restaurant in Chinatown.
Everything made fresh and speedy.
Food is okay. The restaurant is busy but not full."
Hong Kong Bistro Cafe,1,2019-12-31,"Just prepared that you may wait more than 50 mins for food serving. i came here twice. each time me and my friends will waiting more than 50 mins for food after we ordered. no matter how many customers in here. they are always very slow. even fried rice, they will take that long.

And the fried rice. Are not totally sauced... even it took 50 mins to make."
Tacos El Asador,2,2019-02-26,"Cash only.. it's 2019 
Plates with holes in it.. it's 2019
Food is decent, but get the basics right"
Taverna Mercatto,3,2019-03-29,"i tried this place out on a week night for my birthday w.3 of my gfs. we ordered 4 pasta dishes and a charcuterie board to share. our server (short redish hair) didnt seem enthused all night..not sure if thats just how she was..but definitely not on the friendly side. she seem quite hostel towards us than the other server we saw.. but we made our own night fun w.each other! 
service 3/5.

the salami charcuterie board was ok..nothing in particular wowed us with it. she brought it out and dropped it on our table. no explaination as to what was what..didnt know which salami/cured meat was which..didnt even know which cheese selection they had given us either.. it wouldve been nice to know what we were feasting on..i know my friend requested more salami and a cheese that wasnt so strong. i think they gave us brie cheese..

we then got the 4 pastas: orecchiette, bolognese, pappardelle & carbonara.
all of it was really good! forgot to ask for the pastas to be cooked a little more well but the flavours are nice.
braised rabbit was tender. fennel sausage had a nice kick. bolognese meat sauce was delicious carbonara wasnt overly creamy.

overall food 4/5.

atmosphere was nice. dim lit, cute little lights hung through out. lots of seating and tables throughout the place. not sure how busy it would be on a weekend..but id love to come back and try their pizzas!"
Ho Ho Barbeque,2,2019-10-08,I was disappointed with this place for the price they charge their portion is so small I got the duck with rice barely any duck a bunch of cheapscapes the duck was okay honestly the duck at congee Queen was better price and way better taste last time I'm coming here
Mexico Lindo,5,2020-02-23,"Ordered for the first time but I've heard so many great things about this place...
WOW
The portions are huge! Very hearty and fresh.
Everything stayed perfectly hot and ready.

The chicken was so tender and flavourful. 

I'll definitely have to get other things from the menu!"
Como En Casa,2,2019-08-27,"I took the advice of one of the reviewers on Yelp & I got the hybrid burrito.  Boy was I disappointed.  I thought the flavours were sooo bland & the burrito itself was rice heavy & lacked sufficient amount of meat. Seriously I didn't even want to finish it.

Also it seemed like (from the pics on here) that this was a take out place, but it's not.  It's all table service.  

I just think this restaurant did not hold a candle to restaurants in the same price range.  In other words, it was ridiculously over-priced for what you get.  The burrito alone was around $15."
Taverna Mercatto,3,2019-10-24,"A last minute decision as we were staying at Delta Toronto a 2 minute walk from our hotel!

Love the drink list: wine, beer, cocktails. A great place to have a drink with snacks. 

We seated by the bar area, so one of the bartenders was serving us. We were checked on frequently and the service was attentive.

Food was ok, quite standard and did not wow me. I though will come back or a night cap if I am in the area."
El Trompo Taco Bar,3,2019-04-07,"El Trompo has always flown over my head - I've walked by a hundred times but never noticed it. I'm happy I finally did, because the tacos here are amazing! These tacos are more ""street"" than Seven Lives', but there's definitely a time and place for them

While the tacos here are great, I was incredibly disappointed that the chips + pico I ordered to start seemed to be store-bought tortilla chips - they reminded me of Tostitos. The pico was pre-made, and super cold out  of the fridge, another disappointment. Plus, service is spotty."
DaiLo,3,2019-09-23,"Good food and unique flavours but found it a bit pricey for whats it worth. Came here on a Sunday evening to a somewhat empty restaurant that filled up slowly throughout the night. Dishes were flavourful but expensive. The portions are also quite small so if you want to fill up, you'll need to spend quite a bit. I may personally struggle a bit with fusion Chinese restaurants as I often find similarily tasty food for significantly cheaper in traditional restaurants. 

Worth a try but I won't be a regular!"
Grazie Ristorante,2,2019-10-24,"My review is for Uber eats delivery from Grazie.
We ordered 2 pizzas-1 classic margarita and one mushroom. Both pizzas were stone cold and were undercooked. It tasted kind of like frozen pizza you can get from a supermarket. 
There are so many great pizza places in the area and unfortunately this isn't one of them"
Xola Mexican Food,5,2018-05-27,"Absolutely the best Mexican restaurant in Toronto... The other comments stating the same fact are true. The chef and family cook with heart and the result is pure authentic Mexican food that is definitely top class. We tried the steak taco and duck confit... Our taste buds were having a feista on their own. 

Highly recommend this restaurant and will come back for repeat visits."
Fusaro’s Kitchen,5,2018-11-12,"Can't say enough about Fusaros! An affordable and delicious Italian spot in the heart of Toronto, it's one of my staples. I've eaten in, taken out, and even come for just a bottle of wine (which is super affordable at $25 a bottle).

I'm a sucker for their bolognese but before I found my go-to I had tried their Italian sausage pasta and a few of their pizzas. Everything is delicious.

It is somewhat on the simpler side but at the price point it's at, I wasn't expecting something over the top fancy. It's essentially a better and more delicious version of the pasta you'd make yourself at home. Which is nice.. that comfort food .

It's also on the smaller side in terms of location size but maybe it's a hidden gem or something - I've never had any issues getting a table regardless of the day or time I've visited."
Lai Wah Heen,5,2017-08-01,"I'm surprised to read all these contrasting, love-or-hate reviews about Lai Wah Heen as I was fairly impressed with my experience here. And this is from someone who comes from a Cantonese background, grew up with dim sum flowing through my veins, and, as such, is very picky and demanding about it.

Yes, the setting in an otherwise aging hotel building (if the public areas are any indication) might not be the most inviting at first, but when you step inside, the first thing you notice is the clean, well-maintained venue that actually looks like a formal dining room - unlike the average unkempt dim sum house. Next, most of the staff appears to be native Cantonese speakers, which is always reassuring in terms of authenticity (although they do speak Mandarin, as many customers insisted). Perhaps, as someone who could speak Cantonese myself, I got friendlier and more engaging service than others would.

Although I got quite the sticker shock when I first reviewed the menu, I was also pleasantly surprised by how well-presented each item was. The lobster and shrimp dumpling, for example, came in the shape of a lobster, and had good chunks of seafood inside. The deep-fried prawn and scallop wrapped in bacon? Exactly as delicious as the description suggests. A steamed beancurd roll of mushrooms and truffle simply rose above typical dim sum fare. Meanwhile, the crispy fried pastry of foie gras and minced pork was also inviting in terms of its presentation - indeed, French-inspired - and also satisfying going down. Dim sum staples like the shrimp dumplings (har gow) and beef rice rolls (cheong fun) were also on point.

Furthermore, while it's all not going to be the best-tasting, best-value dim sum ever, nothing tasted bland or bad either. Just... decent. In another reassuring sign, I experienced none of the suffocating thirstiness afterwards that you'd get from lower-quality dim sum houses that douse their offerings with MSG or salt. Again, another check mark in terms of quality.

Given the effort they put into the presentation and the quality of the ingredients, I was quite satisfied with my visit here, even if it was quite expensive. Is this going to be a cheap, everyday dim sum experience? Absolutely not. But is this going to be a special treat that rises above the usual loud, busy, run-of-the-mill-quality dim sum hall? Absolutely yes."
Carisma,5,2018-10-12,"Took my friend here for a birthday lunch. It's been a while since then so my details are sketchy but here's what I remember:

Decor is very dark and luxe.

The food was really tasty. I remember going in with no expectations but we both loved what we ordered and were totally pleasantly surprised!

Would definitely return."
Donatello Restaurant,4,2018-07-19,"Came here with the hubby and a friend for a casual dining evening and enjoyed our time here. 

It's something between a casual and formal dinner setting and right in the middle of downtown. They have multiple seating options which is amazing. They had an outdoor patio, indoors on the first floor and a balcony available for seating. On a summer evening, sitting outside was just perfect! 

We ordered some prosecco and enjoyed our drinks when we got some bread and oil. The service was decent but we did feel that they were prioritizing some other customers over us. People who came long after we did got served their bread and drinks while we waited for us. 

Our food was tasty - we got the specials (salmon and pasta) and the chicken in a rose sauce from the menu. Both were delicious. 

The rooftop patio/balcony is where we sat and it was beautiful. I highly recommend sitting outdoors if possible during a warm day. 

When we got our bill, the staff member added the gratuity on it automatically but it wasn't clear. When we asked him to explain what was written on it he started saying something very random which didn't make sense. We had someone else come and explain it to us that it was the gratuity. I did feel that the serving staff could do a bit more to make a better experience in terms of service. But overall this place gets a 3.5 to 4 Star for its food and ambience experience."
Buca Yorkville,3,2019-08-24,"Debated long and hard on what rating to give; ultimately decided on a 3.5, but rounded downwards to a 3! Although I had a great time there with  colleagues, it was really due to the company. The food was decent (neither spectacular nor amazing), but the service was, for the most part, non-existent. It took so long to flag someone down!

We had reserved a table for 10 at 6:30PM, and were seated in a private area, slightly hidden from the rest of the restaurant. To start, we ordered a selection of three salumi di mare. Don't be fooled! While many things here at Buca Yorkville are seafood-related, the salumi does contain some pork options. With the server's recommendation, we got the Soppressata di Polipo (octopus salami which therefore includes pork), Opah (cured moonfish), and I believe the Salmone Affumicato (smoked salmon). Accompanying this spread were gnocco fritto, fried squid ink dumplngs made with pork fat, and two small pieces of pickled onion. The smoked fish was the best and absolutely stole the show! It had a very rich and smoky flavour, and the saltiness whet my appetite. However, the other salumi were just okay.

A must order at Buca is the nodini - these small garlicky bread knots that are little bites of heaven! As my manager says, these are the ""yesdini"". We got two orders for the table, but as the knots disappeared in record time, we ordered another two portions. These nodini really stole the show!

We then ordered our own mains; I got the Polipo e Vongole. A small whole octopus came placed on top of some clams and crispy artichokes, with these al dente small pasta balls (the fregola sarda, which resembles couscous) soaking up the delicious broth. However, the octopus truly fell flat. It was soft, but lacked all flavour - it was bland, unseasoned, and just didn't stand out. For a main that costs $50, I was expecting something a bit more. My colleague ordered the risotto, and was very disappointed as well. It came in an extremely small and shallow bowl / plate, and he devoured it all in the matter of minutes. 

For dessert, we ordered two pairs of three desserts (from the four on the menu) to share:
Tiramisu - This dish barely resembled a tiramisu, and was more along the lines of a deconstructed dessert with a dark chocolate shell and mascarpone cream. It was interesting, but not what we were craving for and wanted.
Pizelle - This dessert stole the show, and was the best! The peach preserve and whipped cream made it appear deceivingly light (although you're well aware it's not, given all the dairy and richness). The presentation was also lovely; when the server poured the ganache over the top, the dessert was just imploring me to take photos!
Torta - I forgot the full name, but this chocolate hazelnut tart served with olive oil and squid ink just completely missed the mark. The olive oil imparted some savouriness to the dish, but the squid ink took it to a whole other level by adding some fishy essence. We left this largely untouched.

The wine assortment here is good, but also pricey (we paid ~$250 for a bottle of red, I believe). If I were to go to Buca again, I'd likely go to the King location for more of the earthy and meaty pasta choices. While this location was decent, it simply didn't meet expectations."
Sichuan Garden Restaurant,3,2018-11-10,"It looks really sketchy outside but don't like it scare u away, cuz the food is pretty good! Let's talk about the 4 dishes we ordered:

1. Dan dan noodles. Okay I'm pretty sure it is not the authentic dan dan noodles but the way they presented it was pretty smart. All the spicy sauce is on the bottom of the bowl because if u can't take that much spicy then u don't have to stir all into the noodles. But other than that no comments.
2. Chicken dry pot. We ordered this because other three plate wasn't enough. It came on a stove and a pot, it tastes amazing but the fire down the stove is just really concerning I wish they could use some protection around it.
3. Spicy beef. ITS SO GOOD and SO SPICY. I freakin loved it!! I'm not joking about the spicy level of this dish so if u can't really take real spicy u need to bring ice milk with u. Also u need to try the numbing pepper that Sichuan cuisine has, it will numb ur tongue and it is such a cool sensation.
4. Double cooked pork belly. It's extremely salty, like super duper salty. We had to order rice to eat this. 

The service: the waiters and waitresses hang around but they r really slow at services."
Mexico Lindo,3,2016-10-29,"I would rate this place a 3.5.  The decor was greatly outdated.  The food was tasty Mexican food, nothing wrong with anything my table got.  Just be weary, if you're not into spice make sure you know what you're ordering with the waiter.  The pictures everyone has posted is exactly what we got.

In terms of the service, it was a one man show.  I get what other reviews mean about the service.  This older gentleman (maybe owner?) took the orders, showed people to their seats, bused the tables, refilled water, etc.  He did everything 2-3 waiters would do.  No surprise that getting his attention would be difficult.  We had no issues with the service.  

FYI, if your mouth is on fire from the chorizo or other spicy sauces, Hollywood Gelato is only a few buildings north."
Sugo,5,2019-08-06,"After a 2 hour wait time, we sat down for a carb heavy meal and every bite was delicious! 

My BF bet his friends they couldn't finish a meal on their own (both of them did.)  haha We shared a meal between us and were both FULL. Great value if you don't bet your friends and end up paying for the whole table Haha!

Blasting music and wine flowing it made for a fun atmosphere!  We'll be back! :) 

We did the Veal Parm & Spaghetti  Apparently it's all homemade."
Ramen Isshin,2,2020-05-20,"I love Ramen and every winter I'm in Japan . Was dying to try   legendary vegan Isshin ramen  since my English teaser highly recommended . TOO SALTY!! 
In Toronto way more better places . May b other dishes would tests batter , I never back to that one . 
Hope it helps"
Blu Ristorante,5,2019-11-08,"Excellent atmosphere, superior service, wonderful food, great wine selection. What's not to love?"
Carisma,1,2019-10-20,"- Not worth for its price. Both service and quality of food. 
- Pappardelle very hard not fully cooked
- Risotto hard as well 
- In this city when there are so many Italian restaurants to compete with, this type of quality simply unacceptable. 
- The lady who served us seemed very unhappy and no smile during the whole dining period.  At the end of the mains, she wiped the dinning table but did such a sloppy job that all crumbles fell on my lap.  I do not know the purpose of doing it. 
- the ""supervisor"" or the manager walked around the room and consciously or subconsciously patted our velvet lounge chair to tell us hurry up cause we might have chatted too long and eating too slow.  
Overall, we are a group of three and we picked this place for our Japanese friend's visit for our first time. None of us would return again.  Pure disappointment."
La Marquesita,4,2019-09-04,"I ordered the pulled pork Campechano Torta which was on special through Ritual eats. It's sort of like a taco one a sandwich was interesting to try. The bread is toasted till it's crunchy which helps prevent it from getting soggy from the salsa's and sauces. The meat was tender and came in a good quantity. One of the salsas was a bit overpowering compared to everything else, but otherwise the sandwich meshed well. Not sure if I would pay full price, since it didn't come with a side chips or anything like that, but as a one off meal I definitely enjoyed it."
Khao San Road,3,2019-06-23,"Food: 4/5
Service: 3.5/5
Decor: 3/5
Price: 4/5

Small and quaint. When entering there was a sign warning about bugs that may look like cockroaches inside the restaurant. It says to not be alarmed they are not cockroaches and it is natural during the summer days for these little insects to find their way indoors. If spotted you can call a waiter to come by and they will sweep them up and take them outdoors. 

The menu's are suuuuper dirty. They do not wipe them down at all! There's tons of grit and its sticky on all 3 of our menu's. The pricing wasn't too clearly shown. For the main's its all the same price located at the very top $16.95 and then you can add on your different meats for a dollar or 2 on top. 

We got two appetizers the garlic shrimp and the fried chicken. They were both delicious!. For the mains the green curry was okay, we got it with beef. Big mistake, their beef is extremely tough! it was super dry, felt like it's been cooked for days and kept in the fridge to be warmed up in a microwave and tossed into the curry to serve. The 3 flavours pad thai was good. had a lot of flavour and ingredients as well. The best out of the 3 was the Khao Soi, i got that one with chicken. Delicious. No complaints. 

We let the waitress know about the really tough beef and she just took the dish and brought it to the kitchen without saying a word. After a few minutes she came back and said she would switch the curry to chicken instead. We agreed and she took the plate back inside. It was a pretty busy night so taking awhile for the food to come out is understandable. I shared the Khao Soi and waited for the green curry to come out. By the time we finished our food it finally came. We just asked for it to-go. 

The service i would say is about a 3.5, she seemed as though she was just rushing through everything without talking with the customers. Food took quite a while as well. I would go back to try their other menu items."
Sugo,2,2020-03-09,This place is overhyped.... the food was quite mediocre however the line was out the door the entire time we were there. We tried the Spaghetti & Meatballs and the Chicken Parmesan Sandwich. The meatball was delicious. However the rest was forgettable.
MEXITACO,3,2019-09-19,"I really had high hopes after Reading the other reviews on yelp. Perhaps my review is a little muddied from the fact that I just returned from Mexico City. Nonetheless I found the food to be tasteful, but I'm afraid most of the food we ordered-  the ceviche and the soup was pre- frozen and de thawed to serve. 

Granted we did come in on Monday evening and it was quite dead so I don't think they had a full kitchen working that night. I think I might return one more time on the weekend or a Friday night to see if the service and the food is anymore fresh."
Hotopia Downtown,3,2019-11-12,"I walk by Hotopia most days on my way home from work, and if you've ever passed by, you've probably smelled that strongggg spicy spice from outside. Maybe just walking by has even cleared your sinuses. It's been packed (usually with a line up) most nights when I've passed by which is why I've waited so long to check it out, but a few friends and I finally made our way here for dinner this past Sunday. I put my name on the Yelp waitlist for five people for 6pm, which turned out to be unnecessary as there were several empty tables when we arrived. (The restaurant got busy later around 7pm, and there were a few groups waiting for tables).

We have varying levels of spice tolerance between the five of us, so we ordered three dishes to share: pea sprouts in broth, steamed chicken with chili sauce, and the Sichuan pepper numb basa. The pea sprouts were the only non-spicy dish we ordered, and it was pretty standard as far as Chinese pea sprout dishes go (including the high price point). The steamed chicken wasn't too spicy and quite oily - watch out for the bones! The Sichuan pepper numb basa was the main dish that we ate with rice - it's definitely spicy, but not too numbing (as long as you avoid actually eating the peppercorns themselves, which I definitely did). There were quite a lot of pieces of basa as well as eggplant, and despite sweating and turning red from the spice, we found ourselves finishing everything. 

Service is pretty friendly, and they were fast to fill up our water (which we definitely needed). The bill came to ~$14 per person which was pretty decent for such a filling meal. This isn't my favorite type of Chinese cuisine as I'll admit, I can't really handle the heat. But I'm definitely interested in coming back to try some other dishes!"
Chula Taberna Mexicana,3,2019-11-11,"We decided to drop by on a late Saturday night, the place was busy but we were lucky to wait only 15 minutes. We ordered the Street Corn, Beer Battered Haddock Tacos, Crispy General Tao Tacos, BBQ Beef Brisket Taco and Pork Shoulder Burrito. 

The Street Corn came out - and was absolutely delicious! The cream sauce on top was the perfect sauce for it. 
When the tacos came out, the Crispy General Tao Taco's sauce seemed to have drenched all the other ones as well, so the tacos were very soggy, and didnt leave much of an impression. Out of the three the Haddock was definitely the best.  Lastly, we the burrito came out, and that was delicious. The salsa, the rice, and meat were so tender it came together perfectly. Overall we enjoyed our dinner at Chula, and would probably come back to check it out in the summer on their patio. We found the indoor restaurant to be a bit cramped (especially the front of the house)."
Ha Gow Dim Sum House,3,2018-08-27,"I think I set my expectations too high for this place. Being chinese I keep hearing how good the dim sum was in toronto. I studied Yelp for a good while trying to find a dim sum place with good reviews. I looked at all different menus from different places and decided on this place. It was cash only so I had money exchanged after we crossed into Canada. We drove 2 hours (there was traffic) to get there. Had to pay for parking. It was a small hole in the wall place with literally 8 small tables total. I've been in many hole in the walls so no judging there...especially if the taste of the food was out of this world good! Not in this case...I must say that I've had better dim sum at a mediocre place in VA. MD by far has the best dim sum so if you're in the Rockville area, try out the dim sum there, both Cantonese and Taiwanese style! 
Anyways my family liked it but their not Chinese (my mixed family of Blasians) so to them, dim sum is dim sum. They did agree that we have better dim sum back home in VA/MD. 
The selection wasn't as great either but I did see the cook in the back making the dumplings fresh. My youngest son love dumplings and he commented that it wasn't as good as my mom's lol. Duh..of course grandma makes the best dumplings. 
The server was very nice but we wont be back. Dont believe the hype! Or at least not from here."
Trattoria Taverniti,1,2019-09-09,"I was craving pizza for supper this evening.  I was walking along College Street and came across Trattoria Taverniti.  It looked interesting and I'd never been there so I thought I'd check it out.

When I got here around 6:30pm, it was fairly empty but filled up pretty quickly.

I ordered the Carne pizza.  It was a good pizza and I ended up taking some home for lunch tomorrow.  The crust was crispy and I guess it was the sausage that had a bit of a bite.

I paid my bill and was finishing up my wine, getting ready to go.  Then one of the servers asked if I would move to the patio to a high top chair because they needed my table.  I said I wasn't going to be much longer and didn't want to move to a high top (I have a wonky knee).  About ten seconds later, the second server came over and asked me to move and I told her the same thing.  About five minutes later, one of the servers said I really had to leave because they really needed my table.  I just had a sip of wine left and again said I'd be leaving shortly (and did).  I felt a bit uncomfortable because the table next to mine was looking over and wondering what was going on.

So what started out being a pleasant meal got ruined.  I understand that a small restaurant needs to turn the tables over to make money.  But if the table was reserved and I needed to be gone by 7:30pm (so in about an hour), they should have said so when I was seated so the expectations were set ... rather than kicking me out because someone else needed the table.  Definitely a customer service fail.  As good as the pizza was, I didn't feel valued as a customer so won't be back."
Dimmi Bar & Trattoria,3,2019-12-22,"Although the surroundings of a cellar-like space was nice, the overall pricey but subpar food, elementary plating/plates, and clumsy service was a let down especially in the Yorkville area.

I ordered their fish special of the night: Swordfish with a Side Salad. It was expensive, but the portion was great and the fish cooked & seasoned well!  The side salad was very basic but fresh, thankfully I had asked for the dressing on the side...especially since we previously ordered the Fried Calamari appetizer that came with some VERY greasy side salads. We ended our meal with some desserts, I tried their creme brûlée, but for $9.95 it was a rip off since the ramekin wasn't fully filled and the custard texture felt a little too whipped. Also, a little ridiculous that they charged us for hot water."
Levetto,2,2019-12-02,"Went for dinner with five friends to celebrate my birthday. The food was excellent until the waiter offer me complimentary dessert. After ""happy birthday"", I dug in to the mini cake. That's when my friend noticed the mould. One of my friends discretely sent the dessert back to the kitchen. The waiter did not offer us a word of apology or a discount. I found that quite surprising and unprofessional. The whole situation left a bad taste in my mouth - not sure I would return."
Itacate,3,2020-03-07,"Came for lunch around 12:30. The place only has two tables and some standing room. After you order and pay, they give you a number and  you seat yourself. 

The tacos all tasted good but were quite overpriced at 6 bucks each. The enchilada tasted good and was better priced at 8 bucks. 

I didn't feel the service was great, the cooks seemed annoyed when orders started piling up or when a customer asked for the provided cilantro/onions/ salsa to be refilled. Space wise the place sucks with only two tables. They also said there was not bathroom for customers ( even though if we paid). Floors and tables were not clean either. 

I also asked their facebook page a few days before my saturday visit if they have tamales. It's on the menu and some reviews on other review sites mentioned they are not usually available. I got a reply within 1 hour that they would have tamales around noon. When I asked about them, i was told they make them some weeks and not others. I do not think they are worth returning to. There are other taquerias in the city that have cleaner restaurants and friendlier staff. Take out might be ok."
Xola Mexican Food,4,2014-05-17,"Good Eats can be that simple and I love how Xola Mexican Food prepares their food. Fresh ingredients and with a touch of love, herbs and spices, Mexican Food is just that simple.

The interior is small and cozy. We were here for a late brunch on a Sunday and there was no wait at all. Service can be a little slow as Xola is more like a family run and with only 1 chef and 1 server working here during our visit.

We shared: 

Horchata ($3.50)
- I never really into Horchata and I found their version not as nutty and creamy as I preferred
- maybe adding rum to become Ronchata next time!

Burrito Lamb ($8.95)
- slow cooked pulled lamb was so soft and moist with a lot of flavour

Fish Taco ($15)
- fish has a nice and firm texture and the breading was so light and crispy!
- love the spicy mayo, guacamoles, pickled cabbage and everything just go so well together!

Good Mexican food is hard to find in Toronto and of course I would be coming back to Xola for more!"
Mariachi’s Restaurant,3,2017-12-21,"The food was good and the presentation was awesome but I expected it to be more flavourful. 

The place is clearly family run and the service was great because of that. The lady who served me was super sweet."
King’s Tacos,3,2019-05-18,The food quality and quantity is good. They are making the fresh food for the right price. One thing they need to improve is the cleanliness of the plates and cutlery. Nice spot for Mexican food.
Buca Yorkville,5,2019-05-31,"TL;DR Upscale delicious Italian seafood

After trying the other Buca restaurants (which were fantastic), we were not disappointed by Buca Yorkville and can totally see why this place is rated in the top 5 for Canada's Top 100 Restaurants. Its quality and flavours are on par with other top-notch restaurants in Canada. 

Spot prawn crudo 5/5 - started with spot prawn freshly flown in just a few hours before. You can taste how fresh it is with its sweet notes and tender meat. It is absolutely divine.

Nodini 5/5 - One of our favourite classic dishes from Buca. The bread knots are small spheres fried with light salt and garlic. 

Nnocco fritto (squid ink dumplings with tuna n'duja) 5/5 - this was our FAVOURITE dish of the night. We had no idea what it us and took Yelp's recommendation for it. It came with 6 little pockets of bread that you can stuff with spicy tuna and n'duja. The flavour and texture was incredible. Definitely give this a try. 

polipo e vongole 3/5 - this octopus dish is where things fell flat for us. The octopus was cooked with clams and bone marrow. Both the clamps, bone marrow, and stock were delicious and rich in flavour. However, the octopus itself lacked flavour and char. When you bite into the meat, there was no chew or tenderness, felt very mushy and bland. 

Bigoli 5/5 - our second time order the duck egg pasta. This is a must try when you come to the restaurant. The noodles are perfectly al dente and coated in duck offal ragu. If you're weirded out by innards, do not fret as you do not taste the gameyness at all. The sauce is rich and rounded."
Levetto,2,2018-11-22,"Overrated non-authentic Italian food. Their location gives them business. 

Menu is interesting but not up to standard. Ambience is okay."
Playa Cabana,3,2019-08-04,"Went here with my friends and family. I liked the spice side fillings and their lobster tacos was good I heard. I had the veggie enchiladas and was alright. Even the veggie tostadas was good. However, I feel the food was expensive for the food quality.
We got the 
Nachos  - small but good
Guacamole and chips - good needed some spice 
Chicken wings - so so 
Veggie enchiladas - was so so 
Veggie burrito - good 
Veggie tostados - good
Shrimp enchiladas - was so so 
Lobster tacos - very good 
Fish tacos - very good 
Pork tacos - was so so"
Hong Kong Bistro Cafe,5,2017-06-21,"This place is awesome. The food is cheap, the food is good, the food is unique. Chinese style spaghetti? Yes please.

It's a bit hidden, you have to go up some narrow stairs to reach the restaurant. The decor is pretty plain but it's not disgusting inside like some other hole-in-the-walls.

I always get the baked spaghetti with seafood in white sauce here. The flavours are so good, the calamari in it is so crispy even when doused in the sauce. Come here with a few friends and try a bit of everything if you can. Or just come back as often as you can!"
Byblos,2,2019-08-09,"Food was nothing special and food took a while to come out. We had the fried chicken - which lacked flavour nothing too great to be raves about. As sides we ordered the cauliflower and Brussels sprouts - which basically tasted like boiled vegetables which also lacked flavours. 
Overall wasn't super impressed, the only thing nice was really the inside of the restaurant with the aesthetics

Follow @cindysfood on instagram for more reviews!"
Dimmi Bar & Trattoria,4,2019-05-24,"This place is in Yorkville and next to Bay Station. It is quite convenient.

I've been here several times, and it never disappoints whatever I've ordered on the menu. The pizza and pasta is always spot on! So, try any and every thing!

I'd definitely recommend this place for its food and its romantic atmosphere!"
Hotopia Downtown,2,2019-11-17,"I recently checked out Hotopia with my friend because we wanted to try their sichuan pickled flavour fish soup.  You can choose different kinds of fish like basa fish.  We ended up with Tilapia.  The pot that came was big enough for 2 to 3 people.  My friend and I didn't manage to finish the pot.  The soup was actually pretty good.  It was more sour than spicy, but I liked the mix of flavours.  The Tilapia unfortunately was overly filled with bones.  I was surprised by this.  The staff didn't caution us about the bones, so we ended up spending the evening spitting them out, which was not my idea of an enjoyable meal.  
Maybe there is an alternative without bones.  I would like to go back and check out other dishes on the menu.  It's a fairly new restaurant, and was pretty packed when we were there.  But service was prompt."
Giulietta,3,2019-05-03,"Some hits and many misses; 
Always sad when slow/ inattentive or simply bad service ruins great dishes. However, the setting, the space, and the wine list are great. 

The food: although executed greatly leaves something to be desired in flavour. Simple ingredients are supposed to speak for themselves here mostly, however more ""cooked"" dishes lacked savoury or original flavours that would make you go back for specific dishes. 

The good:  Cacio e pepe is great- am I running back for it anytime, maybe. 
The disappointing: Avoid the Branzino (sea bass) if you have a problem with bones- they make no effort in deboning it before serving. 

The main issue here is service. It was exceptionally slow; had to call the staff several time for refills, orders, more wine, where's our food... etc. T
he timing between each course needed to be shortened but half if not more. I don't think they want you sitting there for 3 hours without dessert even. There were too many loooong pauses during meal staring at an empty table waiting for another round of dishes. 

With lots of great Italian options in the city I would definitely consider it more like a wine bar with a few nibbles rather than a full fledged hearty meal."
Mariachi’s Restaurant,2,2018-10-13,"Went there on a Sat night at 6pm for dinner before a movie.  
On the plus side the service was reasonably good.  
On the minus side:
1. The prices were much higher than the menu on their website.  This was misleading.
2. The food was small in both flavour and quantity.  

There are far better Mexican restaurants in the area."
Eataly,1,2020-02-21,"OK
in life we are allowed to change our minds.
This place is so CONGESTED and FRUSTRATING.
You had to know it would be a success!???  Rent the whole building out!?  A claustrophobic maze getting in and out of here..  want a coffee/espresso upstairs; FORGET about it; I've been 8 times; only twice was the line under a dozen people, it's good but the line is too long.  Some of the worst cashiers at pizza line; chatting, hugging, orders wrong... I don't think I like this place anymore."
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine,1,2019-12-24,"Worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant! 
The service was so slow; we got our food after exactly one hour. Also, the server didn't speak English, was aggressive, and had an attitude. 
Moreover, the food was served colder than usual and was extra oily. 
We tried to address the issue to the manager but he said: ""it's okay"". 
I don't recommend even giving this restaurant a try!"
Dumpling House Restaurant,3,2019-08-17,"You definitely come here for the dumplings and not the service. In typical Chinese fashion, the customer service here is nearly nonexistent. As we walked in, a waitress barked ""cash only"". Half way through our meal we were asked ""any more?"" and before we had a moment to discuss, we were given the bill. Finally, before we actually finished our food, a waitress started clearing our table. 

However, with that said, their dumplings are definitely their redeeming quality. They are handmade and fresh, from the wrappers to the fillings. They also offer a good variety; they have chicken, beef, pork, lamb, shrimp, and vegetarian dumplings. It is also a fairly cheap eat and it is easy to share. If you are willing to put up with poor customer service for good food, this is a decent option."
Dimmi Bar & Trattoria,2,2018-12-11,"I found this place while walking around Yorkville. I came without reservations but I was seated quickly as the restaurant was fairly empty on a weeknight. 

The restaurant is pretty spacious. They have a private dining room on the upper level for large groups. The ambience is upscale and relaxing.

Service:

The server was nice but she wasn't around very often. I had to wave another server down for more water since my assigned server barely checked up on my table.

Food:
Calamari Fritti - The calamari was pretty standard.

Fettucine Alla riviera -  The fettucine pasta was disappointing as the sauce was underwhelming. It was pretty bland. 

Gnocchi Alla Dimmi - The gnocchi was decent.

Overall:

Great location with a nice ambiance. However, poor service and overpriced, mediocre food. They may be busy but that may be because of their convenient location."
Lai Wah Heen,3,2018-06-17,"Lai Wah Heen offers excellent service and good food. The prices are higher compared to restaurants in Chinatown nearby, but you are paying for better service and food. 

The service is always great here. Servers are attentive and friendly. The atmosphere is casual. Overall, I enjoy most of the items I've had here. You will not leave disappointed if you have a dinner here. The service and food are both great. 

However, I am only giving it a 3 stars because I think the prices are high for what you get. Yes, the food is better than some of the cheaper restaurants in Chinatown. However, it isn't anything exceptional to me for the price they charge. It is priced higher because it is in a great location perhaps. For the prices here, I am expecting more unique items."
Buca,1,2019-10-20,"Service was horrible. I cant explain with the words. We waited a lot for everything. The bill came 15 minute after I asked. Pasta was extremley small but i cant understand this shit. Why dont you put more pastocon the plate ? Pasta is super cheap thing also there is no cheaper pasta than $22. Like just put some more that than i can say it worth! 

Terrible experience I dont reccomend to people go there."
GB Hand-pulled Noodles,4,2020-01-18,"Special Lanzhou Noodles with Beef // GB Hand Pulled Noodles.
--
This place is really small, so there was a decent line  around noon. It's best not to come here with more than 3 people. At the front of the store, you can see the noodles being made as orders come in (I.e. you can see someone physically making the noodles). Pictured here are my friends extra wide noodles. I got the thick noodles (circular with a big diameter). I would recommend the extra wide noodles tbh, because the extra thick ones had a doughy taste when I chewed it since the soup wasn't able to penetrate into the noodle. The extra wide noodles have more surface area exposed to the broth, so each bite would be more flavourful! Also, they have extra chili oil on the side if you want to make it spicier! I actually found it to be at a good level of spice. Overall a decent portion, and they didn't cheap out on the beef."
Lai Wah Heen,3,2020-05-17,"I give this restaurant three stars. I have been to Lai Wah Heen twice, most recently in January.

Lai Wah Heen is a upscale dim sum restaurant located on the second floor of the DoubleTree by Hilton, in downtown Toronto. The restaurant is spacious and bright, the staff is friendly and the service is excellent.

The dim sum is very good but there aren't many, if any vegetable options so it is quite heavy. Also, it doesn't seem very expensive but the price can increase rather quickly when you purchase a few of the higher priced dishes. The bill was higher when my wife and I went here in January than it was when we took our friend last year for her birthday. We particularly liked the crispy shrimp rolls served with sweet hawthorn sauce and the sticky rice filled with assorted seafood & meat, wrapped & steamed in lotus leaf. The spicy, sweet oyster sauce goes really well with the majority of the dim sum and the tea is excellent.

I will likely return to Lai Wah Heen sometime in the near future. I recommend this restaurant to anyone that likes dim sum and wants experience eating it in a high end setting. Three stars."
Trattoria Nervosa,4,2020-02-08,"Came here with a craving for something creamy and truffle-based. Lucky for me, I scoped the restaurant ahead of time and was completely entranced by others' photos of their Mafalde ai Funghi ($23). 

Cutting straight to the chase, the pasta was everything I wanted and needed it to be. It was delicious, creamy, earthy.. yum.. it hit just the spot! Portions were fair, especially since cream sauce pastas are so heavy, but I did find myself wanting some more protein in my meal and ended up sharing an order of mussels with my partner.

Although on the more expensive side, I have yet to find myself a better creamy truffle pasta so I guess I'll just have to take the hit whenever I crave this dish! (But if you know of a better place, please do hit me up in my messages!)"
Buca,4,2019-07-16,"We came for dinner on a Monday night and there was still a decent number of people within the restaurant even though it was a work night. The service was really nice as they helped suggest the best sellers of the restaurant.

Food:  For dinner, we had two pastas: Bigoli and Spaghetti Al Nero di Maiale and two pizzas: Prosciutto con Cipolle and Funghi. The duck ragu (Bigoli) was AMAZING, rich and perfectly cooked at al dente. The spaghetti had a unique taste in which it had a strong smoked taste which is not for everyone. I would recommend the prosciutto pizza because with the fresco it was delicious. On the other hand, the funghi had an overpowering Gorgonzola taste. Do not recommend! 

Overall, this meal was a bit pricey but it would be a great location for a date night as the ambience is dim, classy and rustic."
Kit Kat Italian Bar & Grill,3,2019-05-29,"I did not choose this place myself, but a friend had reservations for our group of friends on a Saturday night. Waited about 20 minutes to be seated. It is a pretty cozy place and very packed, but I assumed that meant it was delicious too! I thought the food was much too overpriced for the portions. I chose the angel hair pasta and it just tasted like something you whip up at home for a quick meal. I admit I should have just chosen something else with more flavor, but the prices were stopping me. 
I did really enjoy the calamari salad though. It was flavorful and perfectly grilled. Delicious. 
I have to note that it was super chilly inside to the point where my teeth were chattering at the end of our meal. 
I would like to come back to try a different dish though!"
Levetto,5,2019-11-09,"Levetto is a place that i go to for quick pasta. The portion sizes are fairly large. One of the pastas we got was under cooked and when we let the server know, she took it and re-made us another one. So i would say they have great service at this location. The pasta noodle here are al dente so if you like more cooked and softer pasta, this place might mot be for you. Also, due to the undercooked vodka sauce pasta, they graciously gifted us a chocolate mousse tart. I thought it was very kind of them and i enjoyed the creamy texture as well as the crunchiness at every bite."
Mi Taco Taqueria,3,2019-09-15,"Mi Taco Taqueria is a festive bright takeout/sit down place to grab a couple tacos and a drink. You order at the cashier and they give you a number so that you can seat yourself during the wait. They have a colorful seating area in the back, with interesting lights and banners to envoke a festive charm to the small space.

We ordered the guac and chips, and 6 tacos. The guac is on the small side but tastes fresh with plenty of herbs and bright flavors. Between the 6 tacos that we had, I prefered the carnitas and the sliced beef tacos the most. The flavoring was the most interesting, while the others were okay but at times a little bland. At $5-6 a peice, the tacos are not cheap but it can be expected due to the popular location."
Donatello Restaurant,3,2019-09-21,"Donatello's has a great decor and great atmosphere. The staff were extraordinarily attentive and friendly. The cost/performance ratio of the food is however a little wanting. I had the mussels which was quite tasty but a bit skimpy for the price. The veal marsala was pretty average at best. The other notable dish was the egg plant salad which is quite imaginative with a layer of pineapple in the middle. All in all, a pleasant experience but would not rush back."
Fieramosca,2,2019-07-04,"It is on the $$ side so I expected a great meal. I ordered Spaghetti Carbonara. I can't believe the fatty bacon in this dish. I basically picked out all of the bacon grizzle and ate the spaghetti which, aside from the bacon was good. 

The atmosphere in this establishment is uptight. The tables are too close together, you feel crammed in. It did not make for a very relaxed evening."
Miku,5,2020-03-20,"I've tried Miku for the first time in Vancouver for my birthday last year and I loved it! So when winterlicious 2020 came out, it was the perfect time to try their Toronto location. They were fully booked for their dining tables so we had to walk in and sit at the bar/high top tables. We chose to sit at their open kitchen and we quite enjoyed the view of the chefs preparing everyone's food! 

For their winterlicious menu, we had the lunch tasting with an option for appetizer, main and dessert. I chose the sashimi selection with 6 pieces and feature kobachi. My boyfriend chose the Miku Zen - tuna crudo, panko fried scallops, truffle tamari Shoyu chicken, tofu salad. We both just shared our appetizers so we could taste more of their dishes. The sashimi tasted fresh and wonderful and their Miku Zen dishes was a good tasting experience. The ingredients they used blended well all together for each dish and I thoroughly enjoyed it. 

For both our mains we had the Signature Aburi Sushi Plate - Salmon Oshi, Saba Oshi, Coal Harbor roll, Bincho Nigiri, Ebi Nigiri. My favourite piece out of the 5 given was the Ebi Nigiri...my gosh it was the best Ebi nigiri I've ever tasted! It was definitely very different from your usual shrimp nigiris that you would order at regular sushi AYCE restaurants. It melted like butter and the texture was very pleasant. I would for sure reorder it again when I come back to Miku in the future. 

Lastly, for dessert we both ordered their Green Tea Opera dessert. The matcha ice cream was a nice pairing with the cake and I also loved the hazelnut wafer piece to finish it off! The server also recommended tea with the dessert to tie in all the flavours.

As for the service here, it's wonderful! Our server was great and they even have free coat check if there's no room to place your coat. After each course came out, the server also explained the dish and all the ingredients on the plate. 

A great first winterlicious lunch experience at $33 + tax! Hoping they offer a summerlicious tasting menu, but regardless, I would love to come here again in the future."
Lai Wah Heen,4,2019-04-03,"I recently attended a dinner at Lai Wah Heen with 9 others. We had made a reservation with the expectation of having a set dinner, but when we arrived, we discovered the menu we had been looking at online was no longer available. We were presented with a few other options and in the end, we selected one that everyone could agree on. 

This was my first time trying sea cucumber and I'm not sure I'll be jumping at a chance to have it again. The texture was really strange, and it kind of reminded me of chewing on cartilage. Not my favourite, let's leave it at that. My favourite dishes of the evening were the scallops and prawns, the Wok-baked lobster and the fried rice with foie gras. They were packed with flavour and left me wanting more. Every dish was quite good, actually - those were just the standout ones for me. 

The dessert was a bit weird, based on comments from a few people in my group. The dessert trio included a soup that consisted of sweetened red bean, which is quite typical for a Chinese dessert and there was a sesame ball with taro inside (I loved this) and a strawberry jelly roll, which I didn't really care for, and was apparently the strangest item in our entire meal, after a very interesting conversation about Chinese desserts. 

Service was really good. There were a few people taking care of us, which helped speed things along when it came to plating the food. They would first bring the large platter to our table so we could see (take photos!) and then swiftly move to a serving cart beside our table and divided everything up between 10 dishes. I much prefer this to letting us serve ourselves, and I wish more places would do this. It takes away any chance of someone feeling slighted if, for example, they didn't get the lobster claw, or the 'best' piece of chicken. 

It was a pricey meal, at $100 per person - plus tax and tip (not including any drinks you ordered) and it's definitely not somewhere I'd be going often, but it was a nice way to spend a few hours. I would definitely recommend it if you wanted to splurge on dinner."
Quetzal,3,2019-08-15,"Quetzal is interesting. There's this big huge space that goes for miles with a glimpse into kitchen. At the front, there's a huge table with natural light, and the bar is impeccably stocked and gorgeous. We sat at the bar, and it was fun conversing with our server who was full of quips and stories. His drinks were equally interesting. 

The food though, for Mexican just wasn't as great as the rest of the restaurant itself. Things were plated prettily (maybe a bit oddly), but nothing popped our taste buds as Mexican flavours should. It was just an okay meal. We left a bit hungry and wanting more."
Wilbur Mexicana,5,2020-03-10,"Simple, fast, delicious. This place is super popular and has lines that extend out the door (for good reason!) but it moves fast and is worth the short wait. Free salsa and hot sauce bar are an awesome addition."
Enoteca Sociale,5,2019-12-17,"I was here over the weekend for a romantic dinner. The staff are lovely and the service was great. Amazing dishes, I highly recommend building your own charcuterie board. It's intimate and candlelit. When I made my reservation, they were very accommodating and replied quickly with answers to my questions."
House of Gourmet,3,2019-09-25,"If you're out late night and want to grab some Asian food, then this restaurant is the perfect spot as it closes at 4am. We came around 9:30pm and the restaurant was pretty packed. You can't expect over the top service compared to other restaurants, but for a typical chinese restaurant standards, this restaurant is on average with it. 

We ordered their bbq pork/roasted pork and the black pepper sauce rice with beef. 
- Bbq Pork/ Roasted Pork: As expected, since it was pretty late at night, the meat wasn't fresh. The roasted pork was cold and the skin wasn't as crunchy vs being fresh. The bbq pork was pretty dry and was not juicy at all.
- Black Pepper Sauce rice with beef: This dish was actually really good which is why the ratings not as low. Since it was cooked fresh, the beef was tender and juicy, and the sauce tasted great. Portion size was pretty decent but for the price you pay, you only really get 3-4 pieces of beef. 

I'll probably skip this place next time if I wanted late night food and try out some other restaurants which were pretty busy as well."
Xola Mexican Food,3,2018-09-28,"It is pretty hard to find good Mexican food in Toronto ( at least veggie) and I'm not talking about the good ole beans and cheese on tortilla! Anyway, this restaurant is NOT in that ""off the hook"" food category. 

Dinner with hubby and child on a Friday evening was alright. This place is pretty small and can accommodate 18-20 people total in the restaurant, sitting is pretty tight. 
Service- mediocre, we had to ask for stuff every time as no one really ""checked in"" on us, excepted once towards the end. 
Price- comparable to other restaurants in the neighbourhood. 
Food- ""average"", nothing different than other Mexican restaurants around. 
Rating- 2.5-3/5"
Comal y Canela,5,2020-01-09,"Having lived in the states enjoying variety of authentic Mexican food, after moving back to Toronto, I have been fairly disappointed and greatly missed real Mexican food. Coma y Canela saved me. Their food is purely authentic. They make everything home made, even the Mole sauce. You will never be disappointed eating here. The only thing is there are not enough seating and you may have to wait for seats if you visit during busy lunch/dinner time."
Swatow Restaurant,5,2020-03-11,"Swatow is a really good Chinese restaurant that I always go after studying in library they speak Cantonese and I love to talk to them in canto too! Much more fun that way! 
And their servings are always pretty big but sometimes could be a bit oily(well, Chinese food XD)
But it opened till very late(around 11pm I think?) so it's always suitable for ppl getting hungry late!"
98 Aroma,1,2019-12-10,"Inattentive staff, over cooked food. Noodle break right apart because it's so overdone."
Terroni,3,2019-11-01,"Authentic italian food served in the same fashion.

Service: The staff were friendly, but the wait times were pretty unacceptable considering we had a large group with a reservation. We arrived on time, but still had to wait upwards of 30 minutes for a table, and it almost ruined the surprise birthday. The food came as ordered, but the waiters clearly didn't communicate with each other as they didn't know who ordered what and had to check several times.

Food: The pasta was cooked al dente, closer to the firmer side. You could tell the pasta was fresh, and they were fairly generous with the truffle shavings. However, the seasoning was a bit overwhelming, as it seemed to overpower the truffle flavour.

Overall: Seating was nice in a semi-private room, food was bene, but waiting half an hour for a reserved spot is not appreciated."
Miku,2,2019-12-10,"I wanted sooo badly to love Miku ...Because of the high ratings and I being a major sushi lover, I had very high expectations for this place. My overall experience was extremely underwhelming and disappointing.. The quality of the food is definitely not worth the price.

We ordered the anniversary prix fixe, signature sushi selection platter, beef carpaccio and tuna tartare. The prix fixe was OK.. quantity wise this one is actually worth the price as you get a lot of courses, but only the sashimi stood out as it was delicious and so fresh that it melted in my mouth! The sashimi is my favourite dish out of the ENTIRE meal... none of our other dishes stood out at all.. they did not taste fresh and to be honest, very bland. The beef carpaccio had barely any sauce on it but for some reason, had such a strong and weird after taste that my partner only managed 2 bites LOL. I've dined at many sushi restaurants and have had way better quality and fresh sushi for less than half the price at Miku..

Service was pretty good. Our server was very sweet, made sure our waters were always filled and checked up on us a few times. It was just a bit hard to understand her when she was explaining the food items due to her accent but its not too big of a deal.. 

I don't recommend and don't plan to return to Miku... so much better sushi out there at a far better price."
Ho Ho Barbeque,4,2019-02-23,"Taste: Amazing and authentic. Definitely 5/5 on this. I mostly order bbq pork but sometimes I'll get the roasted pork. Bbq pork has a sweet savory taste to it, while the roasted pork has a crunchy skin with a soft meat to go with it. If you're sensitive to the sauces and tastes of authentic Chinese cuisine, I suggest ordering the roasted pork instead (and try a friend's bbq pork first before committing to it).

Price: Also 5/5. Cheap - what more do you want?

Service: My experinces, despite my lack of Chinese, has been very friendly with the workers. Yeah, the interior sucks but you're literally just there to order and get out so I don't see much of an issue. Though, it is quite unclean considering they serve food.

Portion: Now this is where my 4 star rating comes from. I agree with the other reviewers that they're cheap and the portions are quite filling. However, their MEAT portions are ridiculously inconsitent. Rice is just a filler to make you feel like there's a lot but you're not going there to pay for rice. As indicated by my picture, that day was a great day. Super filled with meat. On bad days it was maybe half of that or even less because they spread it around to make it look bigger. 

In conclusion: Great authentic Chinese bbq for the price and portion OF RICE, but expect inconsistencies with the meat portion. Don't expect to come here to dine and have a nice flashy interior. Go somewhere else to eat. CASH ONLY."
Greedy Duck & Noodles,4,2018-09-19,"The most authentic Wuhan dry noodles ive had in Toronto! Eat it while its hot and fresh.  

I heard about this place from an article on wechat. The article calls for the duck wings as the must-have. Unfortunately the wings were sold out on the day I went. Instead, i ordered the duck legs. The other reviewer's right, it really is meat-off-the-bones; very tender and flavourful. You can really taste the spicy kick from the seasonings. 


这家做出了超正宗的武汉热干面。从一篇微博看到了这家店，说是ta家鸭翅超级好吃。当时就是奔着鸭翅去的，但他们卖光了。。点了热干面和鸭腿。麻辣味十足，肉很酥很嫩。芝麻酱好香~回味中~"
Agio,3,2018-12-12,"A difficult review to write... have had Agio bookmarked for a long time. 

Pitched it for my work lunch and because everyone trusted me Agio was booked. 

There were a few changes in numbers but the day before I did confirm 9 people with a birthday celebration. 

We arrive to a chilly empty restaurant at 12pm hungry and ready to try delicious pasta. 

We sit and ariund 1215pm i order calamari, trio bruschetta and cauliflower fritters to start. Half of us were there and the other half trickled in. The latest person arrive and we order entrees around 1240pm. 

At 115pm is when we first start to get appetizers. The friendly owner was the only one taking care of tables and cooking. 

Our entrees came around 145pm. The difficulty is that not everyone has a 2 hour lunch. The birthday girl ended up having to leave with no entree just apps because she had an appointment at 2pm. 

We finally wrapped up the meal around 215 with creme brulee on the house, the owner made it specifically for us the might before. 

I liked the apps, amuse bouche of squash stuff grilled zucchini. My spicy tomato spaghetti was delicious and pasta was fresh. 

The chef reminded us this several times that his food is made fresh. 

We ended up being the only table the whole time, off the lunch menu the meatballs werent available and half the table didnt love their entrees. Not 4.5 stars love anyways. 

Disappointing because I felt like the chef should have had someone come in to help or tell us the calamari cant be ordered becausr of the work behind it. Turned out chewy which was unfortunate. 

Just wish there was more communication. It was quite embarrassing for me to be responsible for a mediocre hangry people filled lunch :(

I was still defending the restaurant the next week... ill go back to try with a smaller group. 

It does have character I just don't think it was a good mix for a large group that didn't have 2.5 hrs for lunch."
King’s Tacos,3,2018-08-26,"I was on the street car when I noticed King's Tacos. I was curious so I went in for a bite. I was expecting a fast food restaurant like Taco Bells, but it was a sit down restaurant. King's Tacos decor was plainly decorated in a casual restaurant style. The service was okay, but you have to pay at the front.

The service started with the waitress bringing little bowls of sauce and onions. I am not familiar with Mexican food or tacos. I ordered the Arrachera taco which is made of beef fillets. I added the ingredients and sauces to the tacos to add flavours. I thought that the tacos were okay.

Would I go back? Maybe to try the other tacos. But I am not familiar with Mexican cuisine so it is hard to evaluate the food."
Ramen Isshin,5,2019-11-03,"I've had Ramen Isshin bookmarked for months now and finally got a chance to try it out this weekend. I had very high expectations for this place, especially since I've been looking forward to it for so long. I'm happy to say that I was not disappointed at all! 

We ordered the white sesame shio ramen and black tan tan noodle because they looked unique. These ended up being excellent choices. The white sesame shio ramen broth was light but had an addictive flavor, I found myself scooping for more and more broth with every bite. The black tan tan noodle broth had a very deep unique flavor, I've never tasted anything quite like this in the past. It is a thicker broth than the white sesame shio. It's so hard to explain the flavors, but I highly recommend both! The noodles and pork were great as well but the broths definitely made a more lasting impression. Oh and the sesame grinding was pretty fun as well.

No complaints with the service or the shop. The staff was nice, food came out promptly, and the shop was clean. We went right when they opened for lunch so we didn't have to wait, but the shop filled up within the first half hour and by the time we left there was a line already. Overall a great ramen shop, I'll definitely be back to try out other items on the menu!"
El Trompo Taco Bar,5,2018-09-05,"Just love el trompo
Our server was nice, and their frozen margarita was awesome!! Be sure to get their guac. Very chunky, and even though their tortilla chips were a little soggy, I blame it on humid summer we had. Tacos? Awesome. Grab a seat on the patio and it's great for people watching ;)"
Carisma,3,2019-05-24,"So far Scallop and Foie Gras Appetizer was the best. Ordered appetizer size of of Seafood Pasta dish. The pasta was super al dente, to the point of being tough. The one one mussel I had was gross but the lone shrimp was good, as  was the calamari. 
Hubby's steak was good but my lamb chops left much to be desired. I prefer the taste of Australian or New Zealand lamb and I forgot to ask where it was from."
Artisan Plus,2,2019-12-31,"Tight seating area with not much space between tables, nor to put winter parkas. My friend's seat was more like a plastic stool. Not comfy at all. More of a eat and run place but your tummy might be hungry still. 

The service was good. We got three water refills from the bottle as it was small. 

My dish came out messy and the portion for $14 was small. There aren't enough veggies. The spicy taste was a good quick to it. The noodle looked like gnocchi and it was chewy. My friend's dish came later on as they messed up the order. She said it was ok. Again, one is paying the price for a small portion of food that wouldn't fill up one's stomach 

So definitely I was still hungry before heading to the theatre. 

Verdict- not sure where they are getting the high reviews but it's not worth my time. For $14 plus taxes and tips, I'll rather eat at a food court that would satisfy this Cat-Squirrel's tummy. Bring on the food!!"
Harmoney Chinese Restaurant,2,2017-08-06,Really disappointed. We ordered two dishes and wait like an hour for the fish. Maybe it is because we did not order the right thing. But generally i would not go there again.
DaiLo,5,2019-09-03,"One word - Amazing. 

I got the tasting menu and was absolutely floored. A great fusion of various Asian influences and still stayed traditionally Chinese. Bold flavors and super balanced with fun textures. 

Go for the tasting menu but if that seems too much Is recommend the truffle fried rice, all the dumplings, octopus taco and their drinks!"
Hotopia Downtown,3,2019-12-12,"I've been here once before and had a good experience. The pickled cabbage beef soup was plentiful for two people and we had enough to EACH take home for a second meal. Everything was delicious and I craved it everyday until I went again. 

The second time, there was barely anything in the soup and they forgot the pickled cabbage...the pickled cabbage that's in the name! I brought it to a waiter's attention and she had the audacity to just bring it out in a bowl, did not offer for the kitchen to add it to the soup and recook it. Very disappointed. At checkout they did offer 10% off without me having to do anything, which was nice. But still. How do you forget one of main ingredients?!"
Lee Chen Asian Bistro,3,2019-09-03,"Service 3/5
Taste 3/5 
This overall is only worth visiting for workday lunches. 

If one hunts for delicacy, stay away from this chain."
Buca,4,2019-05-22,"Came here with a few friends for dinner, we had a reservation. The high ceilings and ambient lighting make for a beautiful dining experience!

I ordered the SCIALATIELLI (don't ask me to pronounce this because I have no idea) as I can't have tomato-based pasta and this white pasta was recommended by the server. Of course, portion sizes are on the smaller side but the dish was very rich. We didn't order any appetizers but next time I come back I would definitely recommend sharing an appetizer in addition to the main, as I left a little bit hungry.

We also ordered a bottle of red wine to share, needles to say they only have Italian wines in their selection. 

Overall, it was a great experience to dine here with friends, we spent almost 4 HOURS here talking and having a great time! A part of that was because the server never came to check on us and we actually had to flag them down when we wanted to leave. Oh well!"
Ristorante Sotto Sotto,3,2018-07-19,"Was here to celebrate my bestfriend's birthday. To start of with the service, I thought it was ok..we always had to ask for water refills. I didn't feel that the service was upscale enough for such a sophisticated, classy Italian restaurant.

Our server was knowledgeable and he made some recommendations. He suggested our party to order the Antipasto Gordonia ($24.95 pp) to share as we were all seafood lovers. I enjoyed the grilled calamari and tiger shrimps but everything else on that platter was mediocre. In terms of main, I ordered the Spaghetti Alla Carbonara ($22.95). The texture of the pasta was cooked to perfect al dente which I love. Flavour was rich but a bit too salty for my liking. My other friend who ordered a tomato based sauce mentioned her dish tasted like something she can make at home herself. Overall, food was just ok; nothing special. 

I probably won't come back as I feel that this one time experience is enough for me unless a friend of mine plan to host a party here in the future."
Ristorante Sotto Sotto,3,2019-05-06,"It's in yorkville and it has a cool name so it must be good, right? Right! Only, it doesn't get any better than good. Took my sis for her bday and was so shocked at how basic the flavours were. My mom got the four cheese spaghetti-- it was drippy n barely had taste. Mine was 7/10--a chicken dish, sister said her pasta was ""more wet than buttery"". The best part about this place was the beautiful interior and great service. I wish I liked the food more bcoz everyone seemed so nice."
98 Aroma,4,2016-10-06,"In Chinatown, there is a plethora of Asian dining options to choose from. Recently, I had the opportunity to check out the newly opened 98 Aroma where they offer refined Northern Chinese cuisine. The prices are higher than some of the neighboring establishments, so I highly recommend going with a group of 3-5 people to offset the costs. This way, you can order several dishes to share, as most plates are served with generous portion sizes and are meant for sharing. 

The outside may look unassuming, but the interior was designed to replicate traditional Chinese decor with its elaborate wood ornaments, and Asian-inspired craft works. The dimly lit restaurant sets a very relaxing ambiance, and there are several private booths available along with tables.  

The menu consisted of several popular Northern Chinese dishes like dumplings, scallion pancakes, and spicy seafood and beef dishes. Most of Northern Chinese dishes are characterized by its bold flavors, and dishes are served in big portions. So, you can expect both at 98 Aroma. My friend and I started off with the refreshing Summer Breeze Salad ($9.99) - a colorful mixture of sweet-potato noodles, julienne leeks, bell-peppers, red cabbage, radishes, onions, and carrots with a sweet vinaigrette. 

Northern Chinese cuisine is very wheat-based, so I had to order the Pan Fried Pork and Chives Dumplings ($9.99), which was very good. The crispy potstickers were filled with a generous amount of pork, and the chives gave it a nice aroma after being pan fried. 

Next up was their signature dish, the Steamed Tilapia with Chopped Bell Chilies ($29.99) - the dish arrived in a considerable sized bowl with the bone-in tilapia slathered in a rich yet spicy sauce. The fish was juicy and flaky, and the chili-based sauce complemented it beautifully. However, there were just way too many bones, so be extra careful when eating. 

I enjoyed the crispy texture of the Fried Salt and Pepper Calamari ($15.99), and it was perfectly spiced. 

Out of all the dishes, my least favorite was the Signature Chicken Wings ($15.99). Pricewise, it's pretty expensive for wings, and it was lacking in flavor. The peppers were sporadically spread out to the side, so it wasn't spiced very well.

Overall, I had an enjoyable dining experience at 98 Aroma. The restaurant was bustling with customers that Friday evening, and I thought that the wait staff did a good job of handling the customer service. Since they are a new establishment, there were two new waiters on staff training around that time. They were relatively slow, but it's understandable since they're new. 98 Aroma is a welcome addition to the area as they offer a more refined take on Chinese food, and is sure to please the people in the area looking for a nice place to dine."
Lee Chen Asian Bistro,3,2019-06-18,"My friend and I were in the area, craving Chinese food, and didn't want to walk too far, so we came here for dinner on a Saturday night. The restaurant is nice on the inside and well kept. The waitstaff are friendly enough and pretty attentive. The food is pretty overpriced though and lacks flavor.

My friend ordered the green onion pancake and wonton soup. I had the spicy beef noodle soup. The green onion pancake was average, but the wonton soup broth had pretty good flavor. There were only three small wontons though, which my friend wasn't happy about. I wish the beef noodle soup had some flavor - it tasted like spicy and mildly salty water, which was surprising given how rich the soup looked. The noodles had a nice springy-ness to them, and there was A LOT of beef. I usually complain there isn't enough beef in my noodle soups, but I couldn't finish all the beef in my soup this time!

I'd consider taking friends here if they've only grown up on burgers their whole life and want to try Asian cuisine (maybe bring some spice packets along...), but I would not recommend this place to people who want authentic Chinese food. Take a 25 minute walk to Spadina Avenue instead."
Hacienda las Américas,2,2019-01-04,"I really want to write a nicer review for this place because the food is amazing. And $2.50 fish tacos cannot be beat. The sign advertising said fish tacos is what reeled us in. 

But the service was just abysmal. 

My husband and I were eating around Toronto, so we were ordering small plates everywhere we went so we could get the best of all worlds. We ordered their three for $10 tacos (chicken, pork, and beef) and an extra fish taco for $2.50. All the tacos were amazing, the pork being our favourite and the beef, although good, was our least favourite (it was a bit dry). However, the server seemed annoyed that the two of us were ordering so little. We weren't offered side plates to share the tacos, so they were dripping everywhere and we struggled not to make a mess. We were never offered any water and their sauces were very spicy. Thankfully we had our own. And the thing that irked me most was that we were overcharged $1.50 for our tacos. They write the receipts by hand and were originally charged $10 for the three tacos, but they scratched that out and wrote $11.50. Not a huge deal. I asked why we were overcharged and the server said it's because we mixed and matched our tacos. She was kind of rude when I asked. But all the other reviews seem like it's $10 for three tacos regardless of mixing them up. I think they were mad we took up a table and tried to make it up in other ways. I couldn't care less about $1.50, but I don't like shady business practices."
Stelvio,3,2020-02-15,"The decor was nice and the staff were all very friendly and helpful but it was a veeeery long wait for our main course. I had the Tagliatelle special with sausage, mushroom and black truffles and it was ok, I wasn't that impressed. I wouldn't order it again. But others at my table enjoyed their meals."
Baretto Caffe,5,2020-01-23,"The rose pasta was so creamy and delicious. Highly highly recommend! Along with the hazelnut latte and white chocolate cappuccino, we thoroughly enjoyed our visit to this cafe. It was a bit hard to find at first and busy as we went around 1pm but it cleared up and we found a spot to sit. After trying the food, I understood why this place has a 5 star rating. You also get a free cappuccino if you spend over $20. The owners were so friendly and told us about the same cafe that their family owns in Italy."
DaiLo,2,2019-09-06,"2.5 stars. Nice casual ambiance. The tasting menu is around $190 for two, after tax and tip. I was let down by the food. They have a tendency of using very strong flavours that were overwhelming and competing with each other.

For instance, the pea dumpling had black truffle, bone marrow, and bacon. I wish I could have tasted the pea filling and bone marrow more because that was quite delicious, but it was overpowered by the more dominant flavours.

The wontons in sweet chili sauce was my least favourite dish. It was way too sweet (desensitized my tasting buds for the next dish), and the wonton wrappers mushy and falling apart.

The tacos were doused in aioli and it made the whole thing just taste like spicy mayo.

The fresh leaf wrap was very good and texturally interesting.

I didn't think the tofu ""cheese"" Caprese salad was anything special, but the tomatos were nicely peeled to soak in the dashi.

The smoked duck is a smart menu item because it can be prepared ahead of time and has a longer shelf life, can be served cold (well it was served cold to us so I assume that's intentional). The downside is that the fat is not rendered at all. and cold duck fat can be very rubbery. The skin was also unpleasant. It was not similar to a duck prosciutto where the fat is tasty and thinly sliced. The purple potato mash was very boring.

The ""famous fried rice"" tasted purely of black truffle oil, so if you like truffle you'll enjoy this. Thankfully there were no other competing flavous. I didn't think it was special. I think dousing things in truffle oil is a bit of a copout.

Our server was very nice, but he was quite busy. We had to wait a long time for water sometimes, and the sparking water cups are so tiny that I was constantly running out. No  pitcher or bottle for the table. Time between dishes is also long.

Overall I don't regret coming here, but I'm not sure if I'd come back. The value for the quality of food was not worth it for me. It certainly was interesting to try once."
Mariachi’s Restaurant,4,2018-03-24,"The food is pretty good, the margarita is 5 stars. I tried the fajitas, enchiladas, burritos and everything is pretty good but definitely the best part of every visit is a pitcher of margarita"
Mexico Lindo,2,2018-06-06,"This place has been bookmarked for awhile and I finally had the chance to try out this local restaurant located in Scarborough. This is a takeout and dine in restaurant - very casual.

After ordering at the counter, they offer complimentary chips and salsa. The salsa was so thin and watered down - no flavour whatsoever. I would have rather opted to not have it at all. 

I ordered the Chorizo Quesadilla which comes with beans, rice and salad. There are two sauces on dish but both were bland and lacking any taste. My sister ordered the Chicken Burrito which comes with the same sides, again it was bland and quite disappointing. I'm flabbergasted as to how this place has 4/5 stars when there are other places that taste so much better. Maybe it was an off day but this is not my first time having Mexican food. 

Sure the price is on point and portion is decent but quality and taste needs improvement. 

I'm sorry but I will not be returning."
Swatow Restaurant,3,2020-01-25,"Decent chinese food place

Inside is pretty packed. Our table was next to the washroom lol

The food is authentic. The portions are decent. Price is low, even when compared to similar restaurants in the area.

Cleanliness is ok. Staff friendliness is ok. They make jokes with customers. Overall a friendly environment.

Pretty decent place for chinese food. Will come back!"
El Trompo Taco Bar,3,2019-12-21,"Ordered 5 tacos with a mix of Tinga, Chorizo and Al Pastor. The tacos were shockingly small and costed $10 plus tax. Tinga and Chorizo were meh, kinda lacked flavors. Al Pastor was the most unique one of the 3 with the addition of pineapple. Hot sauces were good, one green and one red. Service was really nice."
Playa Cabana,5,2017-09-18,"Love this place! I had a mad craving for tacos one day, so I took a detour on my way home from work and stopped in for some Mexican fare. 

Obviously, I'm not Mexican and I have actually never even been to Mexico, so I'm definitely not qualified to speak about the authenticity of the food here, but I most certainly can comment on the flavours and presentation of the food. My opinion is WOW... just Wow. Seriously delicious food. I had the octopus tacos, guacamole with chips and finished off with crab cakes. I also had a beer, but in hindsight I should've had a margarita instead. They looked delicious! 

I tried a few different hot sauces, and boy, were they good! A couple were a bit too hot for me, but I enjoyed trying them. I put a couple of drops of each one onto the guacamole as I devoured it, so I could see which one I liked best. 

The octopus tacos were perfection. I should've ordered double and skipped the crab cakes, as they were not as enjoyable for me. The guacamole was fantastic and I loved the house made chips. 

Service was exceptional. I sat at the bar on my own and everyone was extremely friendly and I felt very welcome. Oftentimes, when dining solo, I feel a bit out of place or ignored. Not the case here. It seemed that the staff really went out of their way to make me feel at ease and ensure that I had a good experience. What a difference this makes in a dining experience. 

Can't wait to go back for more tacos!!"
Stelvio,3,2018-03-23,"Hovering between 3 and 4 stars. The food was delicious to be sure, but the price point was extremely high for the portions we received. I realized the pasta is made in house so that accounts for a lot of it, but it still just felt pretty pricey given we didn't really order that much and got pretty hungry again a few hours later.

My husband ordered the ravioli (8 small ravioli in dish. It was FANTASTIC but a tiny portion) and I had the mushroom tagliatelle (also great but just mushrooms tossed in a light sauce with a bit of parsley). We also split the chocolate cake for dessert and I had a glass of wine and the whole tab came out to around $70. WHAT. The night before we ate at another restaurant with dishes packed with seafood, veggies, meat, and more and we spent the same amount of money for around 8-9 small plates of food. And everything was made from scratch there as well. 

The experience was nice, and the food was good but I would probably not return given you can get more for your money in Toronto at other locations and have an equally delicious meal."
La Carnita,4,2018-08-23,"Not too many gooooooood mexican joints in town, but this is a must try spot! I had the beef, pork, chkn and veggie tacos. All were very well seasoned, marinated, and the flavours come together so nicely! Of the tacos i had, one was a bit on the stale side, thats why it lost a star..but service was great! Staff were all very cheerful and friendly despite how busy it was. Keep it up guys!"
Sichuan Garden Restaurant,1,2016-05-21,"Inauthentic and bland. Red flags: No classic numbing spice flavor. Missed the spot on 2 signature dishes so I won't be coming back. 

The cold noodles appetizer was had noodles that were thick and tasted like spaghetti and old lard. No complimentary contents either--you can usually expect some sesame oil or thinly chopped black fungus or something but this was a low effort fail completely. 

The ""mouth watering chicken"" which is a cold chicken dish was sitting in a pool of chili oil and soy sauce (which is normal) but completely lacked flavor and spice--it should carry the sweet flavor of cooking wine, the saltiness of soy sauce and have the savory ""ma la"" numbing spice that makes your lips and tongue tingle. The only thing resembling the classic dish was the fact that the chicken was rather bony and gristly. I had to ask for more hua jiao (si chuan pepper) oil to make it edible 

I'm horribly disappointed and the two dishes cost me $14. It's overpriced at this rate. The decor is austere but rundown (fake wooden footbridge leading into banquet style restaurant that looks tatty) and I guess the fact it was empty on a Friday evening at 9 was highly suspect. Please just go to Si Chuan house cuisine if you're looking for anything nearly close to spicy"
La Vecchia Ristorante,1,2018-08-23,"This place has been on my list of must-try restaurants in the Yonge-Eg area for quite some time (mostly because of all the high Yelp reviews). However, I was pretty disappointed with my experience. Cleanliness is a really big deal to me, and the restaurant did not feel very clean. There were a LOT of flies buzzing around my table, to the point that I had to swat my hand in between every single bite and was afraid one would fly into my mouth (ew!). The bread was cold, and the pasta was mediocre and at a higher price point. The waiter could see me constantly waving my hand to get the flies out of my face and made no comment. I was not impressed."
Khao San Road,3,2019-10-02,"Spice levels were a bit all over the place. The curry was spicier than the pad thai and chicken kua gling, even though we ordered it with less spice than the others. 

The Thai iced tea was pretty good. Started out a bit syrupy but was perfect once the ice started melting."
Artisan Plus,3,2019-08-12,"Tried out this newish place at bay and Dundas. The menu describes the food as northern Chinese and simple. While the ingredients are all fresh, I think they've taken the ""simple"" a bit too far. I tried the short-rib beef dish. The broth is basic and does not have much flavour. That said, the veggies were all fresh and delicious. Just needed a bit more flavour to kick the dish up a notch. 

Decor-wise, the place is hip and modern. Staff are all very friendly and can explain the dishes. Food comes out fast. May try this place again and try a different dish"
Dimmi Bar & Trattoria,3,2019-12-17,"Short and Sweet: 
The food was delicious, but the service was lacking. 

Long Story... Long: 
My friend and I both got the grilled calamari. It was delicious and well made. The calamari was a generous portion that fit the price.

The service, however, ruined my visit a bit. We had multiple different waiters, which was confusing. The one towards the end, who had given us our bill was kind and attentive, but the others were rushed, asked the same questions/clarifications multiple times, and generally felt uncomfortable.

I had asked for a balsamic reduction sauce for my order, if possible. I was told that it was, and the waiter came back with what looked like olive oil and balsamic vinegar together in a small container, which can actually be found on our table. I thought, ""this is not what I meant, but no problem."" I got charged 3 extra dollars for this, which I was both unaware of and unhappy about. Apparently they had added truffle oil, which in my experience is distinct and I can normally tell, but I could not in this instance. This is also where the added price came from.

I would have preferred being warned that there would be an extra charge and that they couldn't do the balsamic reduction sauce in the first place.

Otherwise, I did really like the dish, but the overall experience makes me want to pick another restaurant in the Yorkville area."
Sugo,3,2019-11-27,"This place was really busy on a weekday afternoon (3pm), if you come after 4, there will be a bit of a wait. Customer service is great here, the staff are very friendly. 
I had the giant meatball which was delicious although the sauce it came in was a bit too salty. The spaghetti was good (cooked al dente) and the portion size is huge. The best part of the meal was the tiramisu - it was creamy, decadent and chocolaty, get the tiramisu if you come to Sugo!"
King’s Tacos,3,2019-08-16,Had to check this place out after my friends raved about its authenticity. Staff and servers are warm and welcoming. We ordered take out and didn't have to wait too long. I had the chicken tacos which I found to be dry. May have to try the beef ones next time.
Mariachi’s Restaurant,5,2018-03-10,"Very nice neighborhood Mexican restaurant.  Staff are very friendly (we were served by a young Mexican girl student) and the food was outstanding. Even my Venezuelan girlfriend was impressed!
We will go back there for sure."
98 Aroma,1,2019-04-07,"If I was able to give 0 stars, I would. This is probably the worst restaurant I've eaten at. 

We ordered 5 dishes, 4 of which were completely inedible.
- Traditional pancake: This was our first dish and was fairly tasty. No complaints here. This was the only redeeming part of the experience.
- Green beans with minced meat: It was too salty and too oily. 
- Kungpow shrimp: This is absurdly greasy and spicy which left our tongues numb. 
- Fried rice with pineapple and seafood: In contrast to the previous two dishes that were over-spiced, this was tasteless and (surprise surprise) oily as heck. 
- Lobster with ginger and scallion: This was the most pathetic dish of them all. We were served either a baby lobster that had not yet developed any meat, or they somehow threw out half of the lobster before plating it. On top of this, it did not taste fresh.

Sometimes terrible food can be saved by good service. Nope, not today unfortunately. The waiters were amateur (pleasant, and well-meaning but did not know what they were doing). They gave us a dirty fork, and when we alerted them to it, they took it away then brought it back and said ""we washed it for you"". 

You might look at my profile picture and judge me for being a clueless white guy. I went with a group of 3 other Chinese people who know food well, and we were all appalled at how this restaurant is even open for business."
Banh Mi Boys,1,2020-03-10,"I really want to like this place. I really do. I've gone here since 2013, and then I tell myself never again, but it's so close and convenient, etc. But yeah, everytime I go I wonder why it's rated so high by everyone else.

First, banh mi shouldn't take forever to make. Go to any Vietnamese place and the person behind the counter will literally slap together a sandwich in a matter of minutes. They have a team of people working here and it still takes longer somehow.

Second, the banh mi itself (i.e., the bread) doesn't taste right. It's not crunchy on the outside, soft in the middle. As for the rest of the sandwich, there's something about it that lacks authenticity. Atop of this, it's way pricier than it should be."
Mariachi’s Restaurant,3,2019-12-23,"Amazing food and drinks. The place is more casual and I loved the decoration. We went at autumn so we could still stay at the patio.

The only thing is that my food was supposed to go in the oven, so my husband dish came first. He finished his meal and then I finally got mine. We complained nicely to the server, but I don't think it made difference. 
I also had a frozen Margherita (which I liked very much) But overall, it's a nice place."
7 Numbers Restaurant,4,2017-05-31,"Great homemade pasta, so chewy!
Price is really good, decent portion and love the decor/atmosphere. The menu changes every few days. Service is excellent."
Stelvio,1,2019-07-06,"The service is terrible and the food is not good enough to make up for the awful service. The one good thing on the menu is the risotto with the veal shank, but everything else we ordered was just okay. The waitress we had didn't listen well enough and took too long doing everything. We weren't even there on a particularly busy night, so the lack of good service can't be blamed on how packed the restaurant was. I would save the money and settle for somewhere else instead."
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine,3,2017-10-14,"We were wandering through Yorkville and looking for something to eat when we spotted Dynasty Chinese Cuisine. Dim sum in the middle of Yorkville? Sure, why not.

We requested a seat on their patio and the waiting began. Our waiter finally showed up with menus a few minutes later but honestly, I was baffled (and a little annoyed) by its vagueness. The dim sum menu is devoid of prices, and since our waiter appeared only sporadically, we had to wait a while before we could even begin choosing our food. (Like, if everything is going to cost $10, we certainly weren't going to stay. And because this is Yorkville, that's absolutely a possibility.)

Anyway, he finally explained the menu and the costs, so we decided to order six items. The food was all fine. There were no really distinctive flavors to be found but everything was prepared relatively well. (We did get a short-rib dish that was basically inedible due to a preponderance of bone and cartilage, however.)

I had to wait a while to start eating, though, because I needed a fork and, surprise surprise, our waiter was nowhere to be found.

With service like this and food that's just barely passable, it's hard to envision returning."
La Carnita,3,2019-11-10,"Casual, small place but conveniently located near the tiff building and Princess of Wales and Royal Alexandra theatres.
Lots of taco options and they do offer 1 or 2 vegan taco options. The shells are corn so gf.
you have to go up some stairs from the street to get in so not sure if there is an accessible entrance.
Make a reservation during TIFF."
Jacobs & Co. Steakhouse,5,2019-12-22,"Wide range of steaks, that takes your tastebuds for a journey around the world: Japan, US, Australia and even Ontario towns like Uxbridge and Guelph. We dined in the wine cellar, which has a clear wall peaking into the wine cellar and facing opposite their aging room.

First image:
Wagyu (bottom), Guelph (top) with black volcanic salt, miso salt (brown) and sea salt. Each salt had a distinct flavour adding a unique twist to any steak. Sauces were fresh and diverse, chimichurri was my favourite for its fresh ""just picked"" herb taste, Japanese ponzu was a touch too salty, and the Danish blue cheese and bacon (I did not sample)

It's definitely not an everyday dinner, but for a corporate Christmas party or special occasion, Jacobs is a crowd pleasing spot for a delicious meal in a space that encourages learning the story of your meal."
Grazie Ristorante,1,2020-03-05,We arrived at 9:34 pm two times and they didn't let us to be seat because kitchen is closed. Operation hours indicated til 10 pm and they blocked customer come in 30mins before that doesn't make sense.
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3,2020-03-16,"I'm really not sure why this place has such great reviews, I found the food merely average. The interior reminds me more of the Southeast Asia budget ""backpacker"" vibe, ie partiers. It's certainly a part of the Thai experience but not really my thing.

Tom yum soup - this was pretty solid with vibrant flavors and a good kick. Maybe I've really lost spice tolerance but I was starting to drip before I was done with the cup...

Pad cha hett - mushroom stir fry. I got this with black rice just to try something new and it didn't quite fit the rest of the dish. If you get this, stick with the jasmine. The stir fry part was disappointingly bland though. It had a bit of a fennel taste to it, not sure what that comes from."
Hacienda las Américas,2,2019-09-01,"Hacienda las Americas definitely doesn't live up to the scarce 4.5 star rating it possess on Yelp. The only redeeming factor at Hacienda las Americas were its sauces, which were hot, flavourful and added a nice kick to the entrees. But unfortunately the sauces are meant to compliment the entrees, not substitute them, and the entrees leave a lot to be desired.

I went here with my parents and I got the Carne Asada ($18) and them, the Alambre ($18). The Carne Asada is a steak + rice, beans and salad. The steak was extremely thin, tenderized to a point far from its original state, and couldn't have been more than 6oz. It was not a real steak by any meaning of its traditional definition. Worst of all, the steak was barely warm when it came to the table and it had a slightly foul taste to it and was definitely kept in the fridge a day or two too long. There was nothing in the dish that justified its $18 price point - whether that be the ingredients used, the skill put into making the dish or the quantity of the items. 

My parents got the Alambre (fajitas, rice and beans), which was really no better. Fajitas usually come in fresh out of the grill (sometimes a pan), sizzling, smokey and hot. There was none of that. The fajitas were warm, like the steak I ordered, and seemed more like a product of the microwave than a grill."
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos,4,2019-12-07,"I always had this place tucked away in my Yelp bookmarks but never made it until now. I dropped by with a friend for a snack after Christmas Market and it definitely lived up to it's wonderful reviews!

The restaurant is in the heart of Kensington Market and is pretty small. Only one table that fits about 6 and a bar area where you could stand. I got Gobernador and it was SO GOOD. I feel like this was also enhanced by the fact that we were starving since we are directionally challenged and spent about 15 minutes getting lost before finding the place ...

They were very generous with the toppings, lots of cheese, shrimp, and marlin. Everything was enveloped by two taco shells the outer one was crispier and the inner was soft providing a nice contrast."
Dumpling House Restaurant,3,2020-05-07,"With lots of businesses closing at 6pm, I'm grateful dumpling house is open late, until 10:30pm on a week night!

Since the lockdown, I've ordered their vegetarian frozen dumpling, filled with greens and diced tofu, their frozen green onion pancake and their takeout braised eggplant and sautéed green beans.

As a disclaimer, eggplants are probably my favourite things to eat, and i love how buttery it is here at Dumpling House. Just yummy! As for the sautéed green beans, FYI they are seasoned with lots of minced garlic and a spicy and tangy bean sauce. Proceed with caution if you can't take too much heat! Otherwise, to me its just mildly spicy. 

Love having this in the neighbourhood, a great spot that I'll definitely visit, hope to dine in soon!"
Taverna Mercatto,2,2018-12-22,"Came here for a team lunch and ordered the fixed menu because the main menu apparently wasn't fully available during lunch.....very confusing menu setup but ended up ordering the risotto and cheese fried balls and the roasted chicken.

The risotto cheese balls were surprisingly good because when the dish arrived it was very underwhelming. The balls had a really good crust and when i fried poked into one it had a really good cheese pull. What i also enjoyed was the tomato sauce at the bottom which cut the oiliness of the fried balls significantly, a really good match.

The chicken however was very disappointing. The chicken was very tender on the inside but that was probably because small chunks were undercooked and raw ish....the pasta under was kind of dry and clumped together. Lastly the texture was a little boring, there was a little bit of char on the skin but seems to be only from the salamander so the really wasn't a real crust on the chicken.

Overall the restaurant seemed good but just didnt get a good experience this time."
Asian Legend,3,2017-10-28,"This was our first Chinatown experience and it left much to be desired. I'll start by saying that the menu is extensive, with over 160 items to choose from. Perhaps we didn't order the best dishes.

We ordered the soup dumplings with crab meat and pork, which were the highlight of the night. Both the Sui Mai and the chicken and cabbage potsticker, which were on special, did not hit home. They were both bland and could have used some salt. The last dish, stir fried Ho Fun with beef was good but the beef had an interesting texture, it had no chew and fell apart in your mouth. I'd say the noodles had good flavour but could have been better.

To sum up, the food was good. It wasn't great, it wasn't bad... it was good. The service was great. Food came quickly and servers were always nearby. If I do come back to this location, the soup dumplings are the only thing that I will be ordering again."
Ristorante Sotto Sotto,4,2019-01-03,"The ambience here is romantic and elegant. The service is amazing and the food is good. 

I like getting their pasta here. The pasta dishes may be small but they are rich in flavor. I've had some of their seafood dishes and I enjoyed those as well. Not every item I've tried was impressive but the food is good in general. 

Overall, I think Sotto Sotto is a decent spot for Italian fare if you are in the area. The ambience is lovely for a night out."
Trattoria Taverniti,3,2019-06-14,"Trattoria taverniti is a little place in Little Italy downtown. Staff are very nice and the decorations are very homie. I ordered the rigatoni bolognese and the pasta is uncooked but that's how it is served but it was very good ! The flavor was good the sauce was just right and there was lots of meat in it! My friend ordered the spaghetti and it was a bit salty for him and it was uncooked a bit. The Quattro formaggi was good and very cheesy and oil ! 
The only bad thing was the service it was very very slow. My friend finished his food before us and we had to wait about another 15-20 mins for our dishes to come. Also asking for water took a while to get their attention because they were all zooming by the tables. 

Overall though the food here is quite good but a little pricey"
Lai Wah Heen,3,2019-06-02,"Lai Wah Heen used to be the best luxury dim sum restaurant in downtown Toronto. Overtime, the quality of the restaurant declined. While services and atmosphere still remain the same, quality and price are no longer on par. 

Out of the four items my brother and I shared, the best item was fried bean curd sheet with mushrooms served with aged balsamic vinegar ($5). It was crispy and juicy. Truffle Snow pea vegetarian wrap was unfortunately subpar ($5.5). The snow pea is not picked and over-steamed. 

With that said, it may still be a good option if you are a downtown dweller. However, I would not recommend Lai Wah Heen if you have access to dim sum restaurants in uptown Markham and Richmond Hill."
Stelvio,5,2019-10-21,"My son wanted to have Italian food to celebrate his 18th birthday. I looked at different options and decided on Stelvio. I am glad that this was the restaurant I chose. We walked there from Chinatown and it was easy to find. Our waitress was a class act. She spent time explaining the menu and each of the dishes. I was impressed by how knowledgeable she was. 

She told us the menu changes every season. I decided to go with her recommendation of the Pizzoccheri Di Teglio. I found out that this is hard to find in the United States and it's only served in the winter months in Italy. I didn't know what to expect but it was delicious. My dad and son were also happy with their dishes. 

It was a nice time with family while eating delicious food."
Trattoria Taverniti,5,2019-07-10,"Amazing food, atmosphere, and workers. The owner and his mother are really down to earth and the waitress was super nice and gave good recommendations."
Mexico Lindo,3,2015-02-11,Came here tonight for dinner tonight because of awesome experience last time.  It was pretty empty on a Wednesday evening.  The owners are really lovely and this is why I give it 3 stars.  The food is not what it was when I visited last. I really enjoy authentic Mexican food and unfortunately the food tonight lacked spice that I really enjoy.   The food was flavourful but not nearly as amazing as I remember.  I ordered my food spicy and they wasn't even the slightest tingle :(
Terroni,3,2020-01-25,"I would describe this place as a trendy Italian restaurant. My review will only comment on the pizza as I haven't tried the pastas (it seems like my friends enjoyed them). 
I wasn't too impressed by the pizza, the crust was thin and quite crispy, toppings tasted fresh and good quality but not very generous. It's a good place to go for simple business meetings as the atmosphere is nice and trendy or maybe for a date but if you're looking for a more local small  business type of vibe, I would pass. 
Service was a good and fairly fast. I would mind coming back but not my first choice."
Miku,3,2020-02-20,"Once upon a time, I was really excited to try Miku when it finally came to Toronto. My friend ended up going before me and loved it, so we decided we would do -licious together. That was a disappointing experience so I never bothered going back. Overrated.  

Fast forward a few years later and I'm back again for winterlicious but now it's $53 for dinner. I have to say Miku is consistent. I felt the same way about the food as I did the first time - mediocre. Expectations were met, but only because I was expecting much to begin with. We were seated near the front and had a view of the kitchen. I was initially shocked by the amount of kitchen staff I saw but I guess that made sense because it's a pretty big restaurant and there was a steady flow of people.   

Signature Sushi Selection (Aburi Salmon Oshi, Aburi Ebi Oshi, Coal Harbour Roll, Red Wave Roll, Aburi Ebi Nigiri and ?) - Pretty cool that you get one of each because on their menu, you can choose only choose one type (nine pieces) for around $18. Unfortunately, the pieces were bland and the rice was a little hard, as if it's been sitting out for a while. When there was flavour, it was just the sauce. The best piece would be the Aburi Ebi Nigiri and the worst were the rolls. Very AYCE tasting tbh. 

Sablefish & Lobster Ravioli - Love sablefish and it's pretty hard to mess up but this was probably the worst sablefish I've ever had. It was much firmer than I'm used to, as in when I smacked it with a fork, it didn't budge. I didn't like the lobster ravioli and there was a piece of shell in the filling. The veggies were flavourless and definitely an afterthought. 

Green Tea Opera - It's a sever layer cake and each layer is different, though it really just tastes like chocolate and red bean. Cool, cool, cool, not important. The best part of this whole meal was the matcha ice cream. The texture was more like gelato imo, super smooth, next to no air pockets, very creamy. Perfect matcha flavour, strong in matcha but not bitter and just slightly sweet. Maybe because I just had it and it's fresh in my memory, but I think this might be the best matcha ice cream I've had. 

Grapefruit Basil Smash ($7) - I liked this. Would describe it as sophisticated grapefruit juice. Stir well before drinking or you wont get the ginger beer/spiced honey part until later. Maybe it's the cup but it was a lot bigger than I thought it'd be. 

No problems with the service. Bonus info, I overheard the table next to us ask the server for their version of a California roll and it sounds like they were able to accommodate."
Artisan Plus,3,2020-01-10,"What did I just eat? lol
I tried their Famous YoPo Biang Biang Mian. It's a random mix of everything. It has a lot of vegetables (potato, mushrooms, carrots, zucchini, egg & tomato) if you want a healthier option. For me, it's not a lot of meat, a smaller portion and not very filling. The hand pulled noodles were good, the right texture, but again not enough quantity."
Mexico Lindo,4,2020-06-03,This is one family owned restaurant I love to go. Food are very good. Place is tiny but always have a seat!
Kit Kat Italian Bar & Grill,5,2019-02-09,"Great dining experience. Make sure to get a reservation. Excellent service,  excellent food! Rainbow Trout was divine! And tartuffo dessert... sublime! Couldn't have had a better meal. Everything was sensational!!"
Hong Kong Bistro Cafe,4,2019-08-29,"This place is good! The food is delicious(curry and other meals), and the waiter is friendly. Nice and cozy environment makes it a better place to hang out with friends here. Will come next time."
98 Aroma,5,2019-11-02,"Amazing food, really flavourful and especially good if you want some authentic spice. The interior is beautiful and really clean. It's really close to uoft so I come every now and again. Definitely my go to place nowadays."
Wilbur Mexicana,3,2019-07-23,"For what this spot is, it's fine. It's a King Street taco spot serving the King West crowd. Meaning, it's a bit overpriced (my dining companion asked me ""Are you SURE you only want 3 tacos...?"" while I was ordering) and a bit gimmicky for my liking. To be fair, I was coming off of having some fabulous tacos a couple of days ago at a little neighbourhood takeout where they mostly serve Latinx locals, AND I'm generally not a fan of anything fusion.

You grab a table and then line up to order and pay cafeteria-style. Then you go to the salsa bar for a very good variety of salsas and pico de gallo. Servers bring the food when it's ready. 

The food itself was fine, though don't order the grilled avocado if you don't eat dairy. It's literally just a grilled avocado. Even a healthy amount of pico de gallo and salsa couldn't save it. I found the tortillas really dry.

Atmosphere is cool and the people watching is pretty great. It was very busy with the after-work crowd. I don't think I'd return if I was craving tacos, but I would definitely hang out on their expanded sidewalk patio for a drink and some chips and guacamole."
Giulietta,5,2019-05-10,"I'm putting this into the top 5 restaurants category in Toronto which is very high praise. Very impressed with the dining experience. Here's the breakdown:

Service (10/10) 
- excellent attention to detail. Informative, respectful, timely etc. They knew the menu well, they were able to explain how best to place an order which I find is often very under rated. Many servers don't do a great job of explaining this well. That wasn't an issue here. 

Ambiance (10/10) 
- modern, dimly lit and classy. Enjoyed the unique vibe and ambiance. Interesting lighting and set up with bae cart by the entrance. Washroom were very clean which is also a good reflection of how clean the restaurant and kitchen is likely to be. 

Food (9/10)
- high quality of food. We did 2 apps, split a pasta and meat dish. Best way to dine here is tapas style and to share everything. I could taste quality ingredients and very well executed overall. No issues with the food at all. Enjoyed it. 

Drink (7/10)
- this is the only area I feel they can work on. Cocktails weren't anything to rave about. Wine selection for by the glass wasn't great. Although their selection by the bottle was derailed. If they improve this they'll be taking major steps forward to best Italian restaurant in Toronto for sure. 

Price/value (8/10) 
- priced appropriately for the quality. No major concerns here. Overall great value and experience"
La Carnita,1,2019-10-06,"I have been here a few years ago and not sure what changed in that time but the service yesterday (Sat - Oct 5) was pretty terrible. If it were only one thing I wouldn't really bother but every aspect left the three of us shaking our heads. 
- even after putting my name down an waiting for an hour, we never got the call that our table is ready. Upon walking in after an hour the hostess checked the iPad and just lead us to the table. No clarification about why we weren't called.
- the table wasn't really cleaned-up or arranged. We had to pick it up and move so my friend could get in and not hit the people sitting on the adjacent table.
- the server didn't show up got more than 10 minutes
- when he finally came to take our order, he only took drink order (we were ready to order the full meal as we had waited over an hour and then 10 mins more for the server). Then after a few more minutes the server came and took our food order. 
- Food arrived, but no silverware to eat (salad). And then when we were almost done eating, we had to remind the server about our drinks order (smh).
- Finally had to wait to get the bill and then to pay too. Almost wanted to just walk out really. 
Mind you when we got our table, the restaurant wasn't as busy as before."
Lai Wah Heen,2,2019-07-11,"First of all, let's be clear. Growing up in Asia, I have tasted the best of the best! So I'm not easily impressed by Chinese restaurants overseas. Lai Wah Heen came with rave reviews by Canadians, so I thought I'd check it out and see how it measured up to restaurants in Singapore and Hong Kong.

Verdict - Lai Wah Heen, which is supposedly 5-star here in Toronto, has dim sum that any 3-star restaurants in Singapore (eg. Mid-tier Wah Lok would win hands down) and Hong Kong can easily beat.

The presentation was nice. The taste profile of some of their offerings were decent, but there was only ONE stand-out dish that wowed - and that was the lava custard buns, which were flawlessly executed.

My biggest complaint was the skin on the steamed dumplings. The skin was too thick (especially the lobster dumpling) and chewing through it was laborious.

Overall, it's not worth the price."
Agio,5,2020-03-21,"Really nice guy running this restaurant and excellent food. All pasta is handmade, sauce home cooked. Yoy can tell this chef learned his trade in Italy"
Stelvio,3,2018-12-31,"I really have mixed feelings about this restaurant. I dined here for dinner and tried quite good amount of food from appetizer to pastas. I feel like this place is better for lunch as portions are small and the vibe and lighting in the restaurant was too light for me for an evening dinner. I loved the black and white simple decor, however I would definitely recommend having less light towards evening. 

As for the drink, I tried the Pinot Grigio, and I loved it. If you like an easy white wine with notes of sweetness, this would be perfect.

For appetizer, we ordered a cheese and cold cut board. I was not impressed with the selection of cheeses there. There were two types of cheese and two types of cold cuts. Both cheeses tasted very bland and simple. The portion was fairly good though and it came with a honey and house-made jam which was a nice garnish to it. We also got the meatball to share by the server's recommendation. Probably this was my least favorite item. It was different from a usual Italian meatball you imagine, maybe it is the Milanese way. However I did not like it and it was too dry and meaty. We asked for a side tomato sauce so we can dip them in it.

For main, we ordered two different pasta dishes, the Tagliatelle al funghi porcini and Casoncelli alla bergamasca. They make the pastas fresh in house which I think is what makes this restaurant special. The funghi pasta tasted really good and I loved the mushrooms in it, however I felt it was lacking sauce. Casoncelli alla bergamasca was a meat ravioli with some butter sauce on it, however there was just a little butter sauce on it and it tasted very basic to me. I would say both pastas had very small amount of sauce and both tasted very simple."
Hacienda las Américas,3,2019-08-24,"Unfortunately, Hacienda las Americas didn't live up to the hype. My wife and I went here for dinner and got:
- Guacamole and chips: Guac was surprisingly bland and chips tasted store-bought.
- Sopes: This looked like a thick tortilla with lots of meat and veggies on it. It was 3 for $12, which we thought was a pretty good deal so got 6. The standout was the chorizo (super tasty and great bite). The chicken, beef suadero, beef sirloin, and beef tongue were pretty standard-to-good. The carnitas was too stringy and a little tough for me.

Maybe I'm in the (Yelp) minority and wasn't blown away with this place because I didn't get the tacos... but they were using the same meats for the tacos as the sopes, so I'm doubtful I'd have a different review. Worth a try once, but won't be back."
Mi Taco Taqueria,2,2019-06-28,"In retrospect, it might have been a mistake to order a burrito from a taco joint.

But I'm a burrito guy; I would easily say it's one of my favorite foods ever, so if I spot it on a menu, I'm almost certainly ordering it.

And so it was that I found myself placing an order for a Carne Asada Burrito with all the fixins (including guacamole, which I paid extra for) on a recent Thursday evening.

After a wait of about 10 minutes, my burrito was ready to eat and I knew I had made a mistake with the very first bite. That first taste contained only plain iceberg lettuce and, worse still, it was almost ice cold. Yikes.

As I continued eating, I did begin to taste the Carne Asada and other ingredients and they are, to put it mildly, nothing special. There are virtually no bold flavors to be had here, and though I had asked for the spiciest level of heat, the burrito was surprisingly, disappointing bland.

The meat itself was chewy and unspectacular, too. The whole thing just tasted of a complete and total lack of effort, ultimately.

I might return to try one of Mi Taco's, uh, tacos, but I can't see myself ever ordering another burrito - especially when the far, far superior Burrito Boyz is just around the corner. (Heck, the nearby Mucho Burrito makes a better product!)"
Byblos,5,2019-10-10,"Read about it as one of the top-100 restaurants in Toronto and more than lived up to the hype.  The place had a nice cool but casual vibe.  Service was very efficient, water and wine were constantly kept full and service was always present but not obtrusive.  

The food was the highlight.  We were a group of 4 and share four dishes from the starter side of the menu, three mains, a rice and a couple of veg.  For the starters, the highlight for me (for the meal actually) were the lamb ribs.  Also really enjoyed the hummus with wagyu.  My only disappointment was the ahi, it did not have as much flavor as I expected (and tuna is one of my favorite meats).  I also expected it to be slices rather than a tartare diced style.  Not bad but not as great as the ribs or hummus.

For mains, we went with the signature dish, lamb shoulder, which was excellent and a very good sized portion.  I also enjoyed the middle eastern fried chicken, lots of flavor.  I found the salmon good but not incredible.  I love Brussels sprouts and theirs were excellent.  Also enjoyed the cauliflower.

I skipped dessert but my colleagues loved the sorbet and pistachio ice cream.  Overall, a great meal."
Mexico Lindo,4,2019-02-04,"I always wanted to go here coz it's near Chris' jerk. Hole in the wall about 14 seats and family owned. Have to order at the cashier then take your seat. There was about 10 customers including me and my wife. But there was a lot of pick up and skip the dishes coming thru. We ordered Chorinachos and sizzling fajitas. Once we got the Chorinachos we decided to take the fajitas home. It was a good amount of nachos and meat and it was delicious. We had the fajitas for dinner and it was amazing for take out. The take out container is so nice not ur average container everything separated. The service was very friendly and didn't wait too long. Can't wait to go back and try different dishes, pretty much wanna eat all what's in the menu. I can't emphasize enough how friendly the service was."
Playa Cabana,3,2018-08-13,"I've been duped by yelp reviews!! We were given recommendations for this place as a great lunch spot which was super cute inside and patio area was so inviting. The stars were for the decor and the one dish! 

Food we ordered:
Chile Rellenos- with rice and black beans- this was the star dish for sure, two large chille rellenos and delicious rice. Sauce was tasty as well. 

Guacamole- prepared guacamole probably mixed with fresh avocado, you can just tell it's from a bag because it's watery instead of creamy. Not special at all

Grilled fish tacos- this is so upsetting, they said it was bass, well it's not. If it was it's the mushiest bass I've ever eaten. Three little tacos that that hid the tiny piece of fish for $19 bucks! Sad don't get this

So disappointed"
Cinco Mexican Restaurant,4,2017-11-01,"I've been anticipating this restaurant to open since I saw the coming soon signs. Recently opened, I dined in to check it out.

Food: They have a selection of rotisserie chicken (pollo rostizado), gourmet tacos and street tacos. They also have imported Mexican soda (grapefruit, pineapple and other flavours). If you sit in, they give you complimentary nachos and salsa verde! I tried the 1/4 chicken which came with broiled potatoes and three tortillas. The chicken was the star of the plate, it is juicy inside and held a pack of sweet and savoury flavour. 
I left the pescado (fish) street taco for last, it came with two pieces of battered fish, onion, cilantro and one tortilla. I guess I left it out too long, as the fish was not buttery and moist inside. 

Service & atmosphere: The staff are friendly and as I was a first timer they explained the items on their menu. If you want to know more about the food, they'd be glad to share their origins. The murals along the walls are painted with beautiful detail, I could not take my eyes off them.

Price: The 1/4 chicken plate and fish taco was $13.27 altogether. Leaving with a full stomach on that price seems fair to me. The next time I come back, will try the gourmet tacos. This restaurant is a welcomed addition to Roncesvalles!"
Artisan Plus,1,2019-10-07,"The food here was mediocre but the service was absolutely abysmal, to the point where I'm not even considering the food in the rating I'm giving. 

The server was extremely rude - I asked for an iced tea (canned drink) upon being seated after a 20 minute wait and the server legit said ""just order your drink when you order everything else"" and walked away, even though it was simply a canned drink that takes 1 minute to take out of the fridge. 

When it came time to order our meal, I asked for the drink again, which the server acknowledged. I didn't receive the drink during my whole meal and no one came to check on us so I wasn't able to reorder. 

When the bill came, they actually had the audacity to charge us for the drink that I never received, and when we asked them to take it off the bill they didn't come back with the bill for over 15 minutes, and didn't print a receipt for us because their ""machine was broken"". 

Honestly I'm not sure if we were charged for it, but a place that would allow their servers to talk to/treat customers like this is definitely not a place that I would recommend to others because it says a lot about the restaurant's values and culture, and the food is definitely not special enough to put up with this kind of service."
Lee Chen Asian Bistro,3,2020-05-04,"Lee Chen is an upscale chinese restaurant in the core of the downtown area. Unlike the more dingy (or more authentic) restaurants on Spadina, Lee Chen is carefully decorated and has more catered service. It is the kind of place you bring your in-laws for family dinners and not your friends after a night out. It is deceptively large since it spans the full basement level of the building, so it is easy to find seating.

Expect to find the usual Americanized Chinese dishes here, with flavors that are catered to the general population. Don't expect to find the more 'exotic' dishes or the sharp flavors that Chinese cuisine has to offer."
Homemade Ramen,5,2020-01-15,"One thing I noticed in Toronto is that there are many homemade noodle shop, and there is one on Spadina Avenue that I enjoyed a lot. Homemade Ramen (中國蘭州牛肉拉面) sells authentic lan zhou ramen (蘭州拉面). Once you enter the shop, you can see a chef at the back pulling noodles non-stop. They make the noodles fresh to order, and they have 6 different noodles to choose from. Each has a different thickness and width. 

We ordered two items to share, and of course, we have to order a bowl of Hand-Pulled Noodle with Beef, as well as Shredded Pig's Ear with Chili.

For the Hand-Pulled Noodle with Beef, the default noodles are regular, which are 2.5mm wide. However, I decided to change to leek leaves, which are 5mm flat noodles. Once our order was in, the chef started to pull noodles, though I wasn't sure if he is making our orders. Within 10 minutes, our noodles arrived. The broth is clear and light, with few beef slices and pickled radish. The portion is huge, so it is perfect to share. The noodles are perfectly cooked, nice and chewy. I love the broth so much, and I am surprised by the addition of pickled radish in the soup - the combination goes super well together. 

The Shredded Pig's Ear with Chili came as well. It looks spicy, but it is not. It is on a sweeter side, with the addition of bell peppers. I prefer having just the shredded pig's ear with minced garlic and chili oil on its own. The bell peppers are not necessary here. 

*** Overall Impression ***

Homemade Ramen is another gem on Spadina Avenue. It has good service, clean ambiance, and most importantly, inexpensive noodles. You can get a bowl of noodles for less than $10 here, and I can guarantee that you will leave with a full stomach!  Although I didn't try much here, I will definitely revisit and try other noodle bowls! My recommended item here is the Hand-Pulled Noodle with Beef, and I think the leek leaves' width and thickness are perfect. 

Taste : 4.5/5 * Service: 4/5 * Ambiance: 4.5/5 * Quality-Price: 5/5"
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos,3,2020-04-20,"This place is a small hole in the wall and worth visiting if you crave some good old fashioned tacos rather than the commercial stuff.. portion sizes were good however the flavours were slightly missing for me.. 

I would visit them again if I was in the area, but not necessarily my go to place. Please don't let my review deter you from trying their tacos though, they are still pretty good. 

Flavours can be very subjective and this place is definitely worth a try.. but if you know and love tacos and taco culture as much as me, then you would also know that everyone has their own go to spot.. 

This place has great service, friendly staff and a small seating area if you just want to eat quickly or grab'n'go."
Mexico Lindo,3,2017-11-06,"The food was just ok but, I'm sure they can do much better. I think is a bit overpriced for what you get, mexican food is not supposed to be fancy and overpriced"
KINKA IZAKAYA ORIGINAL,3,2019-11-04,"Heard a lot of hype about Kinka from friends who've been here previously and I wanted to love it but the volume level and food ultimately is what makes me give this place 3 stars. 

It's ABSURDLY loud, can't hear the person next to you talking; get ready to scream your order out. Most of the food was fine to not good but some of the things that I did find pretty delicious was the buta kakuni, miso black cod (albeit way too bones), and the yaki udon.

The karrage had too much batter and was hella dry, salmon oshizushi was bland, takoyaki and okonomiyaki was really w/e.

Basically I've had the same dishes better and at a reasonable volume at other places. Kinka is ultimately a turn up spot and if you treat it as such you won't be disappointed."
Asian Legend,3,2019-04-20,"Not bad but quality control should be supervised.

We order probably once a month and food quality is a hit or miss.

Like today, broccoli was old. 

Some time the beef noodles, the beef is tough."
Eataly,3,2020-03-18,"This place is definitely overrated and way too crowded.

You'll have to wait over an hour to get seated at one of the restaurants and although the food is more affordable than most Italian restaurants in the city, the wait isn't worth it.

If you go, just grab a few slices of the pizza from the  counter along with a bottle of wine, grab a seat and enjoy that.

I'll only be going back to get cheeses and cold cuts from the market ad this was exceptional."
Campechano Taquería,3,2019-11-25,"After many friends had recommended this place, I decided to try it. Honestly, it was pretty overrated. The tortillas weren't great, and the guac was just alright. Glad I tried it because the place is cool, but the food is pretty forgettable."
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine,5,2019-12-30,"A little on the pricy side but that's what you get when you dine in Yorkville. The dim sum is honestly very good, surpassed only perhaps in value by the crown princess a little further down Bay street. A few non-dim sum dishes are excellent as well, including their Singapore noodles and Bok Choy. 

Their staff are as professional as they come. A very pleasant dim sum experience"
Donatello Restaurant,3,2017-09-24,"A girlfriend took me here for my birthday celebration. Loved the ambience here, and we were lucky enough to be seated on the upper deck patio. Beautiful space - the deck was covered by a huge tree decorated by fairy lights. This made it feel like we were in a completely differently place altogether, away from the hustle and bustle of Downtown Toronto. 

The room next to the upper deck had a family celebrating a birthday; and there was a lady playing the accordion for them. Almost felt like we were in Italy!

I'm giving this restaurant a 3 stars rating solely because of the food. I had the Zuppa Di Pesce, which I asked the sauce to be replaced with the rosé sauce.  I wasn't very impressed with the pasta considering the price. Both in taste and in the seafood quality. 

Service at this restaurant was great - we casually brought up that it was my birthday and they brought a complimentary tiramisu as a surprise! So wonderful! 

I would certainly come back here for drinks/appetizer considering how amazing the space is!"
Mi Taco Taqueria,3,2019-02-27,"My husband and I went to this cute taqueria last week. I liked the simple ordering process of ordering your food at the counter and then eating in a tucked away back area of the narrow restaurant that was decorated with colourful pennant flags, strings of lights and wooden furniture (some high top tables, others were little booths). I appreciated the cute street food dining type of vibe in there, as well as the friendly staff at the counter and who brought the food to our table.

We ordered the carnita burrito bowl and the grilled fish burrito bowl since we thought it would be more filling than getting just the tacos. When our burrito bowls arrived, each bowl was filled with fresh vegetables, cheese and sour cream to accompany the grilled fish and pork. While the bowls were definitely filling, they were just okay in terms of flavour. I have to admit, it was a bit underwhelming considering the great reviews this place has gotten. Nothing really stood out - I would have loved to taste more of a marinade on the carnitas and the fish was a bit plain. More seasoning or sauces on the protein would have helped the flavours come together more in the burrito bowl. Again, not a horrible meal by any means but not really memorable either... personally, it was a bit of a miss for me on this particular visit but I may come back another time to try some of their other offerings to see if I can upgrade this review."
Yummy Yummy Dumplings,3,2020-02-09,"The service was great, but the quality of the food was pretty mediocre. Tried 4 different kinds of dumplings - neither of them were bad, but didn't stand out either."
Eataly,3,2020-03-07,"A group of us went for dinner at La Piazza within Eataly. Note this restaurant's dishes are meant to be like tapas and a shared family style - about the size of appetizers. We ordered aranchini, marinated mackerel (scombro), a white (quattro formagi) and a red pizza (bufalo), spinach ricotta ravioli (quadrati), and the rainbow trout entree with fingerling potatoes. Our favorites were the quadrati (al dente with a flavorful creamy filling and lemony sauce to cut the richness), the aranchini (so creamy & cheesy!), and the rainbow trout which was cooked to perfection with a crispy skin. The scombro was very good as well. Extremely underwhelming was the pizza which we wouldn't recommend; the white cheese pizza was sparse on the cheese and very dry, and while the bufalo had more flavour due to the tomato sauce is was soggy/spongy. 

Service was excellent and attentive without being invasive - and our lovely server corrected an ordering error I made without fuss or hesitation when I accidentally ordered the wrong pizza. We were not charged for it which was really appreciated, given it was our first time there and an honest mistake. 

And the whole of Eataly is just fun to eat and shop your way through. Recommend for a great night out!"
El Nahual Tacos,3,2019-11-13,"I got the 6inch shrimp burrito -- definitely not the best burrito I've ever had but it wasn't bad either. I enjoyed it but was disappointed when they said they didn't have any hot sauce?!! You also can't choose toppings either, I'm pretty sure all the burritos comes with the same thing (rice + peppers and onions) Again, tasted good didn't mind that at all but I think my extreme hunger made it taste a lot better, if that makes any sense. I probably won't be back but glad I got to try this place out!!! Maybe if I had tried the tacos my opinion would be different but you can def find better taco places I'm sure"
Trattoria Nervosa,2,2019-11-11,"Unfortunately they did not let us make reservations probably because of the small size of the restaurant. 

I had a really uncomfortable time at this restaurant... let me tell you why...

The seating arrangement of the tables was very poor. 

We were seated on the second floor at a small table. There was another table, located one foot away from us, between us and the wall/window. Directly behind my friends seat was another table, so when she sat down, her chair was almost touching this other table. Directly behind my chair was someone else's chair. We were squished!!

When I sat down my chair was back to back with their chair. There was no room for the people in the table at the window to get out and for the servers to get over to them, so my friend and I had to stand up and tuck our chair in to let them through. When another couple came and sat there, I also had to stand up again and push my chair in to let them through. This was incredibly uncomfortable. 

A restaurant is supposed to be a relaxing place, especially when you are spending hard working money. I shouldn't be standing up and needing to let people through time and time again.

When serving the table behind me, the server had to squeeze behind my chair and stand right against the back and the side of my chair. It was not a relaxing dining experience at all! Service was okay at best, when they weren't getting me to stand up or squish us.

I ordered the malfalde ai fungi, it tasted delicious for the first few bites but the cream was so rich it was difficult to finish and I felt a little nauseous at the end. 

I expected much better!"
Levetto,3,2017-11-06,"First experience: Didn't receive 'regular service' (basic) when dining in, we weren't checked on and had to get up to order another drink and ask for takeaway containers. Tried pizza & rigatoni dish.
Second experience: the following week we ordered the Rigatoni dish (with braised beef) again but for take away there was only  1/4 of the amount of meat so we felt like we paid $15 for noodles and red sauce."
La Chingada,4,2019-04-09,"This little gem of a restaurant has a tapas menu and also some curiously good cocktails.

I tried huaraches which literally means ""sandal"".

It's a misshapen tortilla with sausage, sauce and toppings. It was delicious, albeit a small portion. Also ordered a Chino Loco, sort of a Tom Collins.

An overall pretty good treat in the Little Portugal area. Hard to find places open before 5pm, so glad this one worked out!"
Fudao noodle house,2,2019-02-04,"Cute concept, but the toppings are absolutely horrible! The price is very very low, but I found myself paying less for great food in Chinatown so the low price does not play any factor here.

The toppings to be put into the broth are of the lowest quality. The meat is severely freezer burned and sort of breaks apart in the broth once cooked. Their sausage also tastes like couch medicine in liquid form.. why? Fudao seemed like the perfect place on a freezing Toronto night for me to warm up, but I regretted my decision more and more with each bite that I took."
Chop Chop,3,2018-11-10,"I give this place 3.5 stars.

This little neighbourhood hole-in-the-wall is one major black west of Chinatown proper. I like the industrial minimalist decor and the open-concept kitchen - which means you can hear the comforting sounds of food being prepared and cooked.

The menu is simple - not the 10-page ones you get at the authentic Chinese restaurants like Asian Legend. It seems they've decided just to focus on the crowd-pleaser items.

We ordered the chilli fish and the beef noodle soup. Both dishes came to the table piping hot. The chilli fish is a medium-sized plate of lightly battered, small fish fillets with a nice kick - I give it 4 stars. The beef noodle soup is a big bowl filled with (mostly) tender pieces beef, thick spaghetti-like noodles, what looked like bak choy and broth that also has a kick - I give it 3.5 stars.

The young wait staff seem eager - which is good. (Perhaps some of the more authentic Chinese restaurants like Kwan - at Yonge-St. Clair -  should have some of their waiters get pointers from Chop Chop.)

I would go back for the chilli fish."
Terroni,3,2020-01-31,"We made resos for a Thursday night. Boy was this place packed! I liked the ambiance but felt like it was too noisy. I liked how it was dimly lit. 
I ordered the duck ravioli. Portion size seemed small. Sauce was good but I felt like it was missing something salty! 
My friend ordered the spicy sausage pasta which was tasty as well. She said it was al dente and the pieces of meat were good. It wasn't too salty or saucy.  
The complimentary bread was mediocre. It was cold and came in a folded paper basket. A small bowl of olive oil was hidden underneath. The olive oil was delishhh though! 
Overall it was alright. Prices are reasonable for the quality. I'm not sure if I'd go back again though!"
Como En Casa,5,2018-08-16,"TLDR: Fantastic staff and service, good homey atmosphere and some of the best Mexican I've had in Toronto.

I came here after work one day for dinner. Upon walking in the menu is on a giant poster to your right and it lists out a couple options (no more than 20) and you order and pay at the counter before getting served. As soon as I walked in one of the staff immediately greeted me and welcomed me to the restaurant. I don't usually comment on service, but the service I revived from multiple staff at Como En Casa was absolutely amazing and therefore noteworthy.

I got the enchiladas ($13), which came with rice and beans as well. The chicken enchiladas came in threes with the mole sauce surrounding it, a white sauce drizzled on top of it and some lettuce and a type of cheese stacked on top if it as well. The chicken inside was very soft and overall the enchiladas were delicious. The mole added a nice kick to it as well. The rice was well-seasoned and very tasty and I could've easily downed a couple more servings of it. I'm not usually a bean guy, but the beans were prepared very well here as well. They were mashed to a thick-ish consistency and the taste of the beans was not overwhelming, which I usually find at other restaurants. The meal also came with a homemade mild-hot sauce which was also very good. I think my only complaint is that the portions could've been a bit larger (at least for the rice and beans, which are pretty cheap). However, the meal was good enough to make it worth the price anyways. 

I'll definitely be back to try the rest of the menu."
Ho Ho Barbeque,4,2019-08-17,"I get lunch from here quite a bit, and I usually the bbq pork and duck combo. It's one of the best deals and you get a really good portions. They also give you soup and/or a drink if you want. The quality is pretty good even though the place might look a bit divey."
Donatello Restaurant,4,2019-12-22,"Tiny spot in the over saturated commercial mess that is Yonge-Dundas, Donatello is a welcome institution. I can't emphasize how small this place is but well worth the cramped space for the gnocchi. Absolutely delicious. 
I've been twice; service was great even with a Saturday evening walk-in (my sister and I got the last table - score!)"
Fieramosca,3,2018-06-19,"Had a good dinner here last week! The interior is very traditional Italian and very cozy. Restaurant seems to be in an old house. There is a back patio as well a terrace on the third floor but we didn't get to check those out. 

The meal started with warm bread, we also got a caprese salad which i thought was just okay (tomatoes and basil weren't super fresh). My main was pappardelle with tomato sauce, shrimp and mushrooms. The best thing about the dish was how hot it was when it came out! It stayed hot for the entire time I was eating it which was awesome. I also loved the sauce which tasted very fresh and tomato-ey. The shrimp itself was kind of a letdown - it was a little overcooked and they also had the tails on which made it a little awkward to eat. Additionally, there seemed to be a couple pieces of shrimp shell in the pasta - the first time I ate a piece I thought it was maybe a tail I hadn't put off to the side but when it happened again I realized it was a piece of shell. My partner had the carbonara pasta which he said was just okay. For dessert we had tiramisu, it was delicious and a good portion for sharing. The meal was a little pricey, but everything is in Yorkville.

The service could have been better. We spent some time waiting to give our order and also to get water, and when the server did come by he seemed to be in a hurry. My partner felt bad since we'd come in without a reservation, and he wondered if they needed the table - but if the restaurant didn't have room for us, it's their responsibility communicate that - either tell us they don't have a table available or that we need to leave by a certain time. (Neither of those things were mentioned when we were seated.) Our entire meal was just over an hour long so we certainly weren't taking an unusually long time to eat.

Overall the meal was fine but next time I'll probably try one of the other italian restaurants in the neighbourhood!"
Enoteca Sociale,5,2019-11-16,"One word. FANTASTIC. Came in with no reservation for 2. Immediately the host/ front of house squad accommodated me and got me seated within 2-mins (I was fully prepared to wait for a table). Me and the birthday boy were both first timers - our server had excellent recommendations and he even brought us complimentary olives (WE LOVED THE OLIVES AND BREAD)!!! Ordered off the 3 for 22, the meat portions were GENEROUS... we just came back from Italy in October and felt like we were in Rome again. Some places in TO don't serve portions like that (don't want to say any names - but you know king W isn't your friend). Anyways, carried on and ordered 2 pasta dishes to share the duck and the amatriciana - both were divine. I think the noodles stole the show, thick, soft, and buttery. We ordered the coffee dessert and our server (tall, beard, soft voice, I think he had red hair?) brought  us a surprised cannoli with a candle - very nice touch to end the evening. Other things I wanted to point out - I LOVED the diverse staff, the interior, the soft candles, the low lights, and the intense/bad ass bread cutting lady! She means business. 

Overall, we will be back. Xx"
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos,4,2020-02-16,"CASH ONLY!!! & the location is kind of odd and the place is super tiny! But through it all the tacos are delicious....

All tacos are 6 bucks each. 

I ordered 2 tacos and was super full! I got the smoked marlin taco and the camarones a la diabla.

The camarones a la diabla was so fire!!! All the flavors were perfect. The marlin taco was not bad but a little on the drier side. Def would recommend the camarones a la diabla!

I tried the HOT salsa - and I like spicy but this was reallllly spicy! Good flavor tho but just an FYI for those daring souls.

I did not like that they didn't have small cups for salsa and you had to put your salsa straight on your taco. It's some what unsanitary from my perspective."
Ho Ho Barbeque,3,2018-04-12,"This place is pretty much the epitome of ""hole in the wall."" Tucked into a little strip mall, the restaurant is unassuming from the outside and tiny on the inside. There are no dine-in options - it's take-out only.

When you walk inside, you'll be able to see all the roast meats hanging and spinning. If the doors to the back room are open, you can even see the chefs chopping up the raw meat just two meters away. At the counter, you can see some of the side dishes on display, to help you decide what to order.

The menu has a variety of options, including duck, pork, and chicken, as well as sides such as vegetables and rice. I ended up getting the roast duck with steamed bok choy on the side. The roast duck was delicious - though quite messy to eat, due to all of the juices and bones. The steamed bok choy was lackluster.

The food was tasty and the tiny half restaurant / half butcher shop was quite an experience. It's worth a stop if you're craving some meat and aren't afraid of the grittier environment."
Nodo Restaurant,5,2019-04-03,"GARGANELLI PASTA ---- 

Beautiful restaurant....cheesy, creamy dreamy pasta, the soft crunch from the cauliflower adds uniqueness to the dish. Really enjoyed and it reasonably priced! They also have a great house-made chilli oil that is a MUST add-on, while having this dish!"
La Chingada,5,2019-10-13,"I live in Chicago and I'm spoiled with delicious Mexican food, so this place blew my mind. 

The sauces are amazing. If they sold them I would've brought a few bottles back with me. I had the taco bowl with chorizo and the choriqueso.  Both were beyond amazing. The chorizo is the best chorizo I ever had in my life."
El Catrin Destileria,5,2020-04-27,"Awesome restaurant in the distillery district! The outdoor patio seating is lovely in the summer, and food and drink were all delicious!"
Itacate,5,2018-08-24,"After the first bite of the carnitas taco I ordered, I wanted to put it down and apologize to the chef for all the times I made carnitas at home. What the hell was I thinking? How could I dare to think I had the right to make carnitas when this miracle existed?

I've been back a few more times and ordered more items on the menu. Everything I've had is great. Everything is made fresh right in front of you and the ingredients are all at peak yumminess, down to the chopped white onions at the toppings station. 

Hot tip: come here after 10:30pm on Fridays and Saturdays for their special late night menu. They serve up a few different varieties of tortas (basically subs) that feature a generous helping of meat, cheese (if you're into that sort of thing), and guacamole at no extra charge (I'm looking at you, Chipotle). They have a hot dog and egg torta that has absolutely no business being as good as it is. I watched the chef whisk the eggs, chop up the hot dog and cook it all up on the flat top. The eggs were fluffy as hell and the flavours mixed together into a masterpiece that Imran N. and I couldn't believe. 

So yeah. Go here, be polite and get the best damn Mexican food in the city."
Noodle King,5,2018-07-26,"Well, damn. This place is just too good to be stuck in a dimly lit food court with a dimly lit sign in the middle of almost nowhere.

Of course, I've had it bookmarked for a pretty long time after seeing the outstanding reviews, but it took stumbling upon it by accident while getting lost in the PATH to actually try it out. Definitely one of the best hidden gems I've ever been to! The noodles are absolutely delicious, and the broth was so savoury I literally gulped it down. The shrimp wontons? Huge! I was really surprised to see the enormous pieces of shrimp packed in them. The vegetables were super fresh too - no wilted leaves here! And nothing tasted like the artificial or over-seasoned MSG filled stuff you might expect at a food court (or elsewhere). Can this place open up other locations already??? I think it can give even some of the popular restaurants uptown a run for their money. :P

Can I also just say again, bless you Yelp, you're doing great work :D"
El Charro,3,2019-09-30,The quality is quite good but even after $15-20 you will leave hungry because the portions are way too small
Asian Legend,4,2019-10-19,"This is a really great place for authentic Chinese food! I've ordered a variety of their foods, from xiao long bao to hot and sour soup to Peking duck. All of it is delicious, it's not the best Chinese food I've ever had but it's pretty darn good and hits the spot.

The atmosphere is great, clean and modern. It looks like a high-end restaurant, but the prices are very reasonable!

Service is generally good, but it kind of depends on the day. That's the only reason I'm holding back from 5 stars."
Stelvio,2,2020-03-06,"Pro
Atmospheric, though nothing particularly unique 

Con
Reached out to their e-mail and never heard back
Very underwhelming service - no plates were offered when they came out with bread, difficult to get the attention of the server, had to repeatedly ask for water refills 
Small portions"
El Nahual Tacos,5,2019-09-02,"Delicious tacos. I appreciated the 3 for $13 special. 

It's nice that this place is in a Food Hall, so that my husband and I could experience food from multiple places."
Enoteca Sociale,3,2017-10-27,"This was in a quieter area. The restaurant was really empty when I came on a weekday. They have a small patio area that is facing a small street. We were seated immediately but no one gave us the menus until 5 minutes later. The service was really slow despite the fact that it was early in the evening without many customers. I noticed they were training some employees that day, so only a few were serving the entire restaurant.

Appetizers: Me and my friends tried a few appetizers and we loved every single one of them.The arancini was great, it was so cheesy and the tomato sauce packed enough flavor. My favorite appetizer is definitely the chicken liver mousse though. The mousse was very flavorful and so smooth. The jelly with the mousse added a nice touch. Next best appetizer is the beef crudo. The aioli served with the beef crudo was amazing, and the beef crudo tasted so fresh overall. I say the chicken liver mousse and the beef crudo are a MUST GET here! 

Mains: The pasta we ordered was SOO SALTY! My group kept waving our server for more water. I hope all their pasta isn't like this, it could be the particular one we got. But the pasta was disappointing. The noodles were cooked nicely, but the sauce was just too salty. We also ordered a side dish of green beans which were alright.

In conclusion, I love the food here. The prices are decent. But I would probably stay away from the pasta that we got this time. Perhaps I will try another pasta next time. The service was slow and my table didn't get much attention from our server. I would have rated it higher if there was better service."
DaiLo,3,2019-12-27,"Small portions, and flavors weren't very exciting for ""upscale fusion"". Seemed pretty typical Asian.

Staff was good and attentive.

All in all the atmosphere and experience felt very pretentious."
Fieramosca,2,2019-06-02,"Honestly, I don't know how this place averages 4.5 stars. My review would have been a 3.5 had it not been for the horrible service. 

My party made a reservation for about 12 people and we were given the room upstairs where other parties were dining as well. The layout and spacing in this restaurant are very tight so watch your step. The seating in the front doesn't quite make sense layout wise. When I walked up to the stairs me and an employee were basically dancing around each other to just get by each other...just why.

Our server the entire night honestly had an attitude problem. He basically had a stick up his ***. He was passive aggressive the minute we got there all the way to the end. He asked if we wanted appetizers and since we were waiting on a few people we asked for a couple of minutes. Unlike a regular waiter who would walk away and let you discuss he stood there hovering and just waiting for us to give him an answer before leaving. Even when he was putting dishes down he was just dropping them and tossing side plates here and there, it was completely unprofessional. It was time for pasta and while our waiter dished out the cheese another waiter helped with pepper. But the pepper waiter took a little longer than the cheese and you could hear our waiter yelling at the pepper waiter from the other room. Is this not supposed to be a classy environment? Why are you yelling at him in front of all the customers? 

Aside from the horrible service, the food was actually very good and the portions were huge! I ordered the Spaghetti Mare de Mario and the amount of seafood definitely did not disappoint! There were a ton of mussels but the spaghetti was not fully cooked. I had a chunk of it still stuck to each other and hard...

Overall I do not think this place deserves the rating it has based on this experience."
Good Hombres,5,2019-05-22,"$3.75 tacos! You can't go wrong! This little hidden gem is situated right across from Toronto Western Hospital. You can find street parking for free nearby. The tacos are made fresh and tastes very authentic! The staff are nice and chatty and it's a great place to have nice a quick dinner. I came with my partner and we ordered 5 tacos, quesadilla, and an apple soda for $30. This was the best $30 spent on tacos. If you like tacos, I would rate this higher than seven live tacos in Kensington as it's cleaner, more spacious, service is quick and food is amazing. 

My favourite was the pescado (fish) and carnitas (pork). The fish was cooked perfectly with a crunch and topped with good sauce. The pork was also nicely seasoned and dressed. They offer extra hot oil which isn't spicy (subjective) but the tacos tastes great without it."
Zhang’s Kitchen,3,2020-03-14,"One cold winter afternoon... hungry... cold... wandering mindlessly downtown, I stumbled upon Zhang's Kitchen tucked in the southern side of Elm Street. 

The restaurant itself is not big and I arrived late afternoon. An eerie quietness besets the restaurant. After settling down they started putting on some mandarin pop songs and handed over water and the paper menu.  Service was courteous and efficient. 

Menu wise is extremely limited here, they specialize in yellow braised dishes.  I chose yellow braised chicken with thick noodles; a fine choice for a frigid day. The sauce that was reduced and used to braised the chicken was excellent. The simple flavours created by the cooking wine, ginger, scallion, leek, and other ingredients was delicious and would warm any stomach or heart.  The chicken was equally done well. The chicken was fall off the bones texture (even though their chicken was bone-less) without giving any feeling of it being overcooked. 

What prompted a less than four star when everything sounded great? A few things... first the noodles lacked texture. They were pretty limp and felt like overcooked store bought versions. The mushroom that was added to the dish were the wet variety and the flavour of the mushroom failed to transfer to the sauce. They also added strings of green pepper on top of the dish for aesthetic purposes. This may be a personal thing but I hate when green peppers become fully cooked (while not having been grilled). 

Overall score for Zhang's Kitchen is a solid 3.4. Unless they work on their noodles, you may want to stick with rice."
Noodle King,3,2018-02-21,"I love eating here on my comfort food/cheat days.

They have classic Hong Kong style soup noodles and bbq rice dish.  The noodles are made to order.  They have rice noodles, thick noodles, egg noodles to choose from.  Toppings include beef balls, fish balls, bbq pork, shrimp wonton, prom wonton, chicken, lemongrass chicken, beef stew, and others.  Better yet you can pick and choose.  You can get additional toppings like half size wonton, tofu, or beef sauce to add-on.  You can also pick just broccoli or bak choy.

You can pick rice dish too.

There is vegetarian options.

Their soy bean drink is small but tasty.

Staff is nice and friendly.

Line is long but service is fast."
Buca Yorkville,4,2019-03-04,"This place is fancy and has decent service. Came on a Sunday for brunch and didn't have to wait too long for our table even though we made reservations. 

So it was my choice of giving this place a second chance. A few years back we hit up the king west location and were heavily disappointed with the service and food quantity. Put it this way, we had pizza next door after dinner. 

For brunch the ambience was quite cozy and there was a good view of outside. Our server was attentive and was willing to accommodate for my wife's cheese limitations. 

As a starter we got the black truffle cortini and they were willing to separate in to one without cheese. It was very delicious and heavy in the truffe. Reminds me a bit of France. It went quite well with my cortado. 

For the main I ordered the bison and wife had the duck egg pasta. The portions don't seem like a lot but for lunch it felt quite heavy. The duck pasta was creamy and had a distinct duck flavour to it. Pasta was just right with some chew as well. As for the bison , it felt like dinner. The rich and savory taste made every bite lasting in my mouth. In hindsight I should have paired it with some red wine. Both dishes are highly recommended. We left quite satisfied. One regret is we didn't order the famous little buns. Maybe next time"
Homemade Ramen,4,2019-03-21,"Was absolutely starving after a morning at the museum and then decided to go to Homemade Ramen. I asked for a table of one for lunch and was immediately seated. They have a menu and a notepad you can write on for what you want (which is kinda interesting). Then give the notepad to the waiter/waitresses and wait for your food!

Sliced noodle stir-fry with lamb ($11.99) - I loved the sliced noodles; unfortunately for me, it wasn't uber uber thick. However I did love the noodle flavor and there was a lot of stuff on the plate for the price that I paid. They have a good amount of meat in there and I was absolutely enthralled of that fact. There were some vegetables in there that I didn't really like, but you know, to each their own haha. I loved having it stir fried and I loved the flavor that came out of it. It's good and aplenty.

Also went for the scallion pancake which I enjoyed; it was cut in 5 pieces. It's a bit of a crisp but not too much scallion flavor really in there, but I do love the flour flavor in there.

Food comes out at a good pace; service is decent - flag em down haha. I do wish I knew what the option for thick noodles are, but not noodle soup hahahahaha."
Baretto Caffe,2,2019-09-18,"I was so looking forward to trying this place out based on all the Yelp reviews and I'm sad to say, my experience here was not a good one.  The cafe is so quaint and located inside a non-descript office building with a cute Koi pond to the side.  

There were 3 people working during a busy-ish lunch time and it took them 15+ min to just take our order.  My daughter's cheese pizza came out first with extra sprinkling of Parmesan cheese which she hates.  It would have been nice to know that even a cheese pizza would come showered in Parmesan.  My husband's lasagna took 30 min to arrive with the same amount of Parmesan on top.  You can see the amount of Parmesan on the photos below.  This was perhaps the best dish of the day still.  The lasagna had a nice meaty sauce and was definitely a pre-made lasagna that was reheated which made us wonder why it would take 30 min to just reheat and serve a premade lasagna.  My fettucine primavera also came doused in too much Parmesan in a tomato sauce that was way too watery and sweet.  Let's just say my pasta was beyond disappointing.  

Based on this experience, I am not sure if I would return here any time soon."
Terroni,4,2020-02-06,"My friend and I came here for her bday. We went during the day time as it gets pretty packed during the night time. The ambience is nice and fancy but still casual. Keep in mind you're probably going to be seated really close to another table.

I ordered the Quattro Stagioni pizza. It was okay, I expected better it tasted kinda basic especially for the price.

My friend, I believe ordered Taiatelle all's Bolognese. I tried some and it had good flavour but nothing amazing.

Also, we got the calamari to share which was really good!

Overall my experience was good. I just wouldn't go back again, there are so many other Italians restaurants that are better."
Lee Chen Asian Bistro,4,2019-08-07,"Lee Chen Asian Bistro is a decent spot for Chinese food near the theatres and financial district. It may look small from the outside, but it's quite large and spacious in the inside. The interior is very clean with nice decor. It even has a small garden and mini running waterfall just outside of the restaurant (great if you can score a table by the window, facing the mini garden). The customer service is very attentive and superior for a Chinese restaurant (e.g. the servers come by your desk to ask if everything is ok a few times throughout the meal, which usually doesn't happen in most other Chinese restaurants).

The menu contains some typical Chinese dishes. During weekday lunch hours, they have a separate lunch ""combo"" specials which are pretty good. Each combo comes with a choice of carbs (white rice, brown rice, fried rice, or fried noodles), meal entrée (protein / veg choices), bowl of side salad, and a spring roll. I ordered the brown rice and it came in a cute bamboo container. The entrée was nicely presented on an edible open flower-shaped bowl made out of crispy wonton skin.

The restaurant is a great choice for having a business or team lunch. The large space can accommodate large parties if booked in advance. The ambience is also nice and not too loud."
Eataly,3,2020-03-11,"Eataly is located in the Manulife building but it has its own entrance (you have to walk past the Manulife building entrance) to see the Eataly one. If you go in the Manulife entrance, it's like a wild goose chase trying to find Eataly - there's no signage or direction anywhere. 

In general, Eataly is a nice concept for all things italian. The items are a little on the pricier side and you can get most items elsewhere for cheaper. But as my friend said, it's the Eataly experience.

There are a few restaurants (reservations recommended), counter type food stations, desserts, coffee, a bar, and a grocery store with meats, cheese, olives etc. 

I also think a lot of the produce products will end up in the garbage - you can see them starting to turn bad. Not sure if there is a large enough market for those products. 

Overall, it was a nice place to visit but the experience was just okay. It can get crowded with people everywhere just browsing. The food was just okay (we ate at La Pizza and La Pasta, and had a cannoli and a tiramisu after). I feel like I've had better Italian Food elsewhere. 

Come for the hype once and then spend your $$ elsewhere."
Blu Ristorante,5,2019-06-25,"I love this venue so much. We rented out the entire place for a VIP dinner after a conference, and they made our group feel like royalty. I wasn't the main coordinator of this event but ended up playing a part in the execution. Every staff member from the bouncer to the bartender was helpful... our guests commented on that, too!

Throughout the evening, the Blu staff proactively looked for guests that needed coat check and showed them the way. We didn't even ask them to do that. Nothing was ""below them"" in terms of customer service. My colleagues and I sat at the bar for dinner because we were tired from event production. We were well taken care of in terms of food and drink.

I had the beet risotto for dinner and tiramisu for dessert. I can't remember my appetizer, but it was similarly amazing. Such flavor and texture. I was floored. Love the prix fixe menu with a few options per course. Not sure if we branded them or they did, but it elevated the experience, and everyone enjoyed their time here. 

We had a projector for some announcements but didn't use it because  conversations were too loud. Good problem to have at a private networking dinner! I can't think of a single thing I would have changed. The restaurant got crowded, but that's probably because we invited too many people. On Blu's side, it was perfect."
Trattoria Taverniti,5,2019-10-23,"An amazing casual dining spot with great food. One of the better carbonaras I've had in Toronto. A great spot for a family outing, date night or casual dining with friends. 
I thought the prices were very good and the portions perfect. 
LOVED IT!"
El Catrin Destileria,3,2020-01-14,"Guacamole was good but portions are not that big. The price of dishes are fine. Atmosphere was very nice. For the desert we had churros with chocolate and caramel sauce and they had really good taste and texture. We did waited some extra time for service and we shouldn't, because at that time restaurant wasn't to busy.. No free parking."
Asian Legend,3,2019-11-23,"Since living in LA and having a chance to go to Din Tai Fung whenever I wanted, it makes it really hard to think anywhere else could be better. This place was authentic and tastes like bistro dim sum. We got the soup dumplings, shrimp steamed dumplings, and scallion beef rolls."
La Chilaca Taqueria,5,2019-08-28,"Honestly one of the most delicious taco joint ever!! Huge size Al pastor steak burrito is just $9.05 including tax. Even tho it's not wrapped up with rice, but it's densely packed with black beans, cheese, meat, pepper, onions, and your choice of salsa. They have 5 different salsa with different spicy level, and I choose to mix the 2 most spicy one together. The staff were super nice, it's honestly a hidden gem in Kensington market, I loved it so much. 

Burrito - Al Pastor Steak - $8.00 ($9.05 including tax)"
King’s Tacos,4,2019-10-24,"I really like this place. It is bright and clean. The food is good and the service is great. There are two shortfalls; no fish tacos, no liquor license. I always get refritos, guacamole, and tacos al pastor. Al pastor is always missing the Pineapple but is good nonetheless. This place needs to serve beer, una cerveza por favor!"
MEXITACO,3,2020-02-10,"I've been to Mexitaco a couple of times now and they've been good enough. The servers are friendly but not as attentive as I'd like, make sure to really confirm what you've ordered to ensure nothing has been missed and if something doesn't arrive soon, check with your server because it probably wasn't punched in. The atmosphere is fun but small, and busy on weekends, so make reservations if you have a group. 

The nachos with added guacamole is good but don't expect much cheese happening with these, it's mostly tomatoes, onions, and sour cream; the added guacamole really helps, but wish their guacamole was thicker because it's very slurry like.

The elote was not good here. It didn't look or taste like it was actually grilled, plus the mayonnaise and shredded cheese combination grossed me out. I've tried other Mexican style street corn that are much better.

Out of the tacos I've tried, the baja fish is my favourite, followed by the carne asada. I find their tacos are on the drier side so make sure to really use the supplied limes, salsa, and hot sauce provided after you order. I would not recommend the baja calamari taco, it was 3 sad tiny battered calamari rings (like the sad frozen ones) that were also chewy and flavourless. 

The frozen margarita with added Coronita was unexpectedly salty, so I would not recommend. Try their Pina Colada instead - can be a hit or miss.

We've tried other things on the menu that are okay but this is what we will typically order every time and basically what not to order for next time."
Mariachi’s Restaurant,3,2018-07-24,"It was fun get together at Mariachis last week when me and my friends decided to go here. 
We primarily wanted to try the spicy margaritas. We got the jalepeno cucumber pitcher and the spicy pineapple one. Both were delicious. They got us the frozen style margaritas and I am not sure if they have the on the rocks option. 

During summer they have seating outside which is a small space with quite a few tables in the area. A decent place to sit, however it can get crowded. The place is located on the main road so it's easily accessed. 

We ordered food chicken fajita and our friends got the enchiladas. The fajita were a bit too saucy and wasn't really crisp. We also got some guacamole and that was delicious. So foodwise it was so-so but for drinks it was a really fun place to be!"
Sichuan Garden Restaurant,3,2018-11-19,"I come to 川味轩 occasionally and every time think to myself ""oh no looks like they closed down"" because of the state of disrepair of the storefront. 

Once inside, it's the same familiar servers and that awful plaid carpet. The prices haven't changed much over the years and neither has the menu, although I did notice the portions are smaller. I always get the lunch specials Kung Pao chicken, a tofu dish and spicy cold noodles which never disappoints. Lunch specials come with a soup of the day. 

Tasty, good value and a viable option if you are willing to relax your standards of cleanliness."
Dimmi Bar & Trattoria,5,2019-11-24,"Food was excellent!!!
We ordered a margherita and capo pizza - the sauce was incredible and the crust was literal perfection!!

We then ordered the gnocchi, agnolotti and pesto cream pasta. Let's just say that the table got real quiet because we were too busy eating!!

We then finished with the tiramisu, creme brulee and a pecan pie for dessert. All three were super delicious. Tiramisu seemed to be made in house, super moist. Creme brulee had a hint of cinnamon with a perfect glassy surface of sugar. And the pecan pie was warm and decadent, almost resembling a brownie.

No complaints - service was impeccable.

Highly recommend."
Mariachi’s Restaurant,1,2017-05-12,"Almost gave it two stars (read to find out more) but the one thing I can't get over is serving an alcoholic drink to someone who specified ""virgin"", when you delivered it to the table she checked again that it was ""virgin"", you agree verbally it had no alcohol, she tries some, tastes alcohol and then you go -- ""Oooh actually this one is the virgin"".  Sure, if she was pregnant or on medication or driving, maybe the sip of alcohol wouldn't be *that* big a deal.  But if she was recovering alcoholic, that one sip could literally change her life, and it's up to you as a business to be honest and knowledgeable about what you're serving.

Things that were terrible:
- we had a reservation, they called us to confirm it was for 700 pm, show up, they say oops we thought 730 pm, they literally have to move people from their seats to accommodate us
- during the 45 minute wait for all this to take place, they took drink orders from us multiple times, but never served us drinks
- they dropped an entire plate of steaming hot chicken fajitas on the ground, it splashed boiling sauce all over people, and their clothes as well
- when i went over to the owner at this point to say - now that we are covered in fajita sauce - can we please have the drinks we keep trying to order? she made a HUGE stink about it, just immediately responded, ""We didn't do any of this on purpose, do you understand? We are doing our best"" and then going to every member of my party reiterating that, as though I had done some rude injustice to her, it was super embarrassing and unprofessional
- drinks still took an extra hour and they weren't good
- they served the birthday girl fajitas with no tortillas or sides, just the meat (she didn't ask for that modification)
- the food was so awful my poor fiance actually sent his BACK -- and this is a guy who complains about NOTHING
- bills took over an hour after asking MULTIPLE times
- the place was so warm they had to keep opening the front door to let in cool air

It almost got 2 stars because they did pay the dry cleaning bill for the jacket that was covered in fajitas sauce, but honestly, I can't forgive the alcohol incident.  This whole experience was stressful and awful. I have no idea why they took our reservation (none of us had been there before), we were clearly too big a group for them at 700 (or 730..or 800...depends who you ask) on a Saturday!"
Mi Taco Taqueria,3,2018-05-30,"Cool decor, nice location, funky music and great service by everyone I interacted with. 

They have a selection of Mexican beer available as well. What better way to have a taco and a beer in hand? 

I ordered the pork burrito bowl, lots to fill you up. It tasted quite good. But nothing to wow me to come back to try it again. The spice level I ordered was medium. I think it's a bit lighter than you think with the spice level. 

My friend ordered the mix of tacos trying 3 different types. He claims the beef was by far the best one. 

I did enjoy the spread of hot sauces available to use on top of your ordered spice level."
Baretto Caffe,3,2019-10-30,"The first thing that'll happen when you arrive (after a tiny struggle to find this place cus it's in the corner where the main entrance is) is that you'll be greeted by the nicest lady everrrrr! You can order at the counter for takeout or have a seat by the windows and she'll come over to take you order.

We ordered the alfredo pasta and a pizza. Pizza was a thin flatbread style pizza topped with some cheapo cheese. The alfredo pasta was a good size for the price but really tasted like nothing special. Pasta wasn't homemade and the sauce was pretty average. 

Service over Food here!"
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine,3,2018-08-28,"I brought my dad, stepmom and half siblings here for dinner as they were visiting from Vietnam and craving some Chinese food and I wanted to take them somewhere classier than the Chinatown restaurants.  BIG MISTAKE.  You can take a girl out of Chinatown, but you CAN'T take the Chinatown out of a girl!!! The service was not good. 

First of all, for the area and price point, I expected to be able to ask the servers about the menu but apparently they don't know why is popular or well-liked. Secondly, my dad and stepmom had a quiet hushed disagreement and the server near us started giving them dirty looks. Everything else was based on lack experience from the servers. Appetizers coming out at the end of the meal, lack of napkins despite having three kids at the table, failure to clear emptied dishes.  

The food was pretty good. While it could not make up for the poor service, I would order takeout from them but I will not dine in again unless there are extenuating circumstances."
Nodo Restaurant,5,2019-11-04,"Wonderful restaurant located in the Junction.  Great atmosphere and good service. Best gnocchi in the city.  The riceballs are also a must try. & make sure to save room for dessert-they have a great array of scrumptious desserts. 
Highly recommend."
Bar Buca,1,2019-10-02,"Very disappointing! Service is very arrogant service. 
We were asking about the menu and were met with cold and short replies as if we are suppose to know everything about this restaurant ... while it was the first time that we are coming to this restaurant. 

The portions are over fried / too small/ and not tasty at all. Pizza is a joke ... it's not event a pizza it is a dough with ...no .. not cheese ... with something g like cheese...
Anyways - waste of time / money / and mood."
Ha Gow Dim Sum House,5,2020-03-20,"Went inside randomly cause I wanted some chinese food but didnt get the kind i was expecting. Needless to say this restaurant has completely opened my eyes to how delicious authentic chinese food is. You literally see these people make everything fresh infront of you too, its not some premade stuff they pull out of a container its legit ingredients. The people were super friendly and accomodating too, even though i walked in with no cash the guy pointed me out to a bunch of places with ATMs and apologized for it, was really chill even though I wasnt sure of what i wanted and suggested the safest choices and what he thought i would like. Stellar service, most places cant get you out of the door fast enough and i cant go back to those fake chinese food places, they dont compare to this hidden gem. If you're in Toronto and you want good food get it from here people!"
Ha Gow Dim Sum House,4,2018-11-26,Got to this place recently. The shrimp dumplings were delicious. At least to my tastes. It has been a long time since I last got dim sum so I can't really compare to other places but I certainly enjoyed my meal and would like to come back again.
Chula Taberna Mexicana,4,2019-12-10,"I went back here and had the zucchini fritters and brisket burrito. Both were really good! I want to try the tacos again, but loved the burrito."
Mexico Lindo,5,2019-06-05,Amazing chicken enchilada ! The food was extremely filling and couldn't finish my plate so I had to take it home! Very good Mexican food ! Would recommend !
Como En Casa,1,2019-02-08,"$16 dollars for the worst burrito bowl/platter ever, are you friggin kidding me. Maybe because it was take out but that's hardly an excuse. The portion size is just pathetic, and the chicken was pretty dry even though it was fairly flavorful. It's not value for the money at all, highly disappointing. Go look at the photo and tell me if that's worth it. At least try a little."
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos,4,2020-01-30,"Knowing where to get the best tacos in town is serious business. As it stands, the best tacos that I have ever eaten have been at Tacofino in Tofino and Tres Carnales Taquería in Edmonton. After reading that Seven Lives was voted #1 Best Taco 2018 by NOW Toronto, named in National Geographic magazine's Places of a Lifetime article, and called #1 Best Fish Taco and #1 Best Tacos by blogTO... They seemed like a sure bet.

You'll find Seven Lives located in Kensington Market, one of the most eclectic corners of the city which suits them well. I visited the tiny shop on a Friday evening, prior to their early closing time of 7pm. They're definitely more of a lunch or early dinner type of place. It should also be noted that they accept cash only, so come prepared!

The tiny shop is bustling and exciting, buzzing with taco energy. The bright walls and giant sign that reads ""TACOS"" sets the vibe perfectly. I also appreciate their logo of a cat with a fish in its mouth - and the insinuation that this cat is down to seven lives, having already lost two. There is one table that can seat about four people and then there's a little bit of standing-room-only counter space. This makes things a little bit awkward if you plan to eat-in, as I did. The table wasn't available and so I stood at the counter in front of the window to eat instead. Which was fine. But certainly not ideal.

The menu is fairly straight forward, including nine types of tacos, some sides, and some beverages. Your order is placed at the counter with a friendly staff member and they call out your name once the food is ready.

Starting with something to drink, I was happy to see Agua de Jamaica on the menu. I always prefer an agua fresca when visiting a Mexican establishment, although I was also happy to see that Jarritos Mexican sodas are also on offer. (Their cola is my personal favourite of all of the colas.) Agua de Jamaica, otherwise known as ""hibiscus water"" is a beverage that exists in several cultures. In Southeast Asia it is known as Rosella tea and it's basically the same thing. Tart and sweet, this refreshing drink was a perfect accompaniment to the food.

We decided to get a Side as a bit of an appetizer. Tortilla Chips (Made fresh! - $3.00) and Guacamole ($3.00 for small) seemed like the way to go. I was a bit surprised that the guacamole didn't just come with tortilla chips and that both items had to be purchased separately. However, I did enjoy the homemade nature of the chips and that a heaping amount of them are tossed into a brown paper bag and given to you. I'll take a bag of chips any day. Golden and ultra crispy, these tortilla chips are exactly what I wanted them to be. They were seasoned really nicely as well. The guacamole was fresh and bright, with a great acidic kick to it. Obviously chips and guac are a match made in heaven.

Next it was time for the big show: the TACOS. Of the nine tacos available, two of them (the Adobada and the Carnitas) were already sold out. On the plus side, I probably wouldn't have ordered either of these anyway. Although, I must say that this did not leave much for meat options. There were four fish/seafood tacos, one beef and one chicken option, and a vegetarian. Nothing for pork at all. But again, I did not mind at all because I was going full ocean food - it's what they specialize in, after all.

Baja Fish ($6.00) and Gobernador ($6.00) were the ones for me. I loved the little condiments bar to the left of the counter that featured three different salsas (hot habanero, medium tomatillo, mild guajillo) as well as chili oil with sesame, and a bowl of sliced limes. This makes it very easy to customize your tacos to your preferred specifications and to control the amount of heat that you desire.

The tacos did not take very long and before I knew it, a green plastic basket was placed in my hands. The tacos were certainly vibrant and demanding to be eaten.

I began with the Gobernador (smoked marlin, shrimp & cheese). If Seven Lives has a signature taco, this is the one. Their front window even says ""home of the Gobernador"" right on it. I definitely loved the smokiness from the marlin the most, while the shrimp filled out the taco and added more texture. Everything had been grilled up deliciously. The pickled onion brought a great hit of balancing flavour and I liked the fresh tortillas a lot.

Next I had the Baja Fish (fried haddock). The first thing that I noticed is how generous the portion of fish is! The haddock was big, juicy and fried to perfection. The rest of the taco was kept very fresh with cabbage and fresh homemade salsa on top.

Both tacos were packed full and were pretty messy to eat, but in the best possible way. I liked both tacos but found them to be missing something that I can't quite put my finger on. I guess that I was hoping for something even bigger and more unexpected in terms of flavour. They were good... Just not the best that I've ever had.

I was also very impressed to see a C"
El Nahual Tacos,3,2018-06-12,"Stumbled upon this restaurant while searching for lunch before heading to Yorkdale. The restaurant is quite small, more of a takeout joint and seats about 6 people. The restaurant is very hot and humid and there was only one fan facing the window. There is free street parking (depending on the time), however there is paid parking directly in front of the restaurant.

We ordered the 3 for $12 ( Black Tiger Shrimp, Fish & Carnitas tacos). The food was flavourful, however it didn't hit the spot for me. We also took advantage of the free chips and salsa check in offer.

Overall, nice presentation of the tacos but I wouldn't be going out of my way to come back to satisfy my taco cravings."
Lai Wah Heen,2,2019-06-08,"Stopped by on a Sunday for some dim sum, having visited previously ~6 years ago and recalling an enjoyable visit. Lai Wah Heen is on the second floor of an aging Doubletree Hotel in Chinatown. The hotel has seen better days, but the dining room is fine and clean, if dated. Our experience with the food on this visit was quite mediocre. While nothing was off putting, the flavor and quality were not a good as we had remembered, and certainly a far cry from our best dim sums in China/HK. Honestly, there were no clear highlights. Service was above average for a Chinese venue, i.e. you don't have to flag down a waitress, but nothing to write home about. While we are out-of-towners, believe there are probably better options for dim sum."
Ristorante Sotto Sotto,1,2018-11-06,"AVOID 
TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE
BETTER OPTIONS ELSEWHERE
-  was served 3 risottos when I asked for one, and was blamed by the staff that I ordered that many
-  risotto was raw as well

I was quite excited to try this place with two friends. The miscommunication ruined the whole experience for me. 

Knowing that the lunch stops at 3pm and that the risotto takes 40 mins to cook. I called in ahead of time to speak to someone around 1:30pm to have my amalfi risotto ready as I was making my way there. I spoke to a server, I informed her that I wanted 1 order of the Seafood risotto for a table of 3 people. I think it was this point where the miscommunication happened. She agreed and said it will be ready for us.

We arrived at 2pm, we spoke to the initial server and I asked him about the risotto, that I called in about. And he's like is it for here or to go? I told him that we were dining in. 

We were seated and waited for 40 mins. Before the risotto came out. To our surprise they brought us THREE RISOTTO dishes. Mind you, on the menu the risotto dish serves 2 people. At no point in time between 2pm to 2:40pm there was any clarification on the order. So I asked the server and informed him that I only wanted 1. So he fetched the server that I spoke to on the phone. And she insisted that I ordered 3 Risottos. I tried to explain to her that party was not ready to eat 6 peoples portion of risotto.

My experience is already ruined at this point. I don't know why she would think that I would want 6 people amounts of risotto. I could've tried other things in the restaurant. 

The risotto itself looked amazing. So if the food was okay I didn't mind.

Unfortunately the risotto was under-cooked. It had a grainy, sandy texture that stuck to the teeth. I informed my guests, and another one agreed with me. I let the server know, he brought Chef Massimo Renzi tableside and he just told me it was cooked al dente, and that he used carnaroli rice. 

So know we're stuck eating extra risotto that was under-cooked. My other friend thought the rice was fine, until he tried the one underneath the top layer. I'm assuming that the chef probably tasted that top layer and thought the other rice cooked as well. 

The seafood in the risotto was perfectly cooked but the dish was spoiled under-cooked rice. 

I think ultimately the experience was ruined when I got 3 Risottos instead of 1. Which caused the quality of control to go down on the rice. 

You will see in the photos that you can see the centre of the rice. Which is an indicator that the rice was raw."
Taverna Mercatto,2,2019-09-05,"Came here for a late lunch with my boyfriend. Love the ambience and the decor of this place. Unfortunately, this was the highlight of the entire meal. Service was very lack-lustre, perhaps we caught them at a time when they were recovering from the lunch rush. A bit disappointing considering there were only a couple of tables and you'd think service would then be on point.

We shared the frutti di mare, some olives, and the chitarra carbonara, and a couple of glasses of wine. The frutti di mare was quite fresh, but the portion was quite small considering the price point. The olives were pretty delicious and was a great little appy. Unfortunately, the carbonara, which looked amazing was flavourless, dry, and lacked any seasoning. The egg itself was fantastic but barely provided any flavour or added any creaminess to the pasta.

I was really looking forward to finding a staple Italian restaurant nearby, but with all the other Italian restaurants in the area, I can't really think of any reason, why we'd come back to Taverna Mercatto."
Miku,3,2020-02-19,"Winterlicious Dinner Review $53

Finally got to try Miku for their winterlicious dinner menu. For $53 you got an appetizer, a main and a dessert option.

Appetizer:
Sushi Sampler - included some pressed sushi's (shrimp and salmon), two nigiris (shrimp and sea bream), and two pieces of rolls (spicy red tuna and a white tuna one). The sample was decent tasting. My favourites were the two nigiri pieces as they were very fresh and flavorful. The pressed sushi ones were okay as well and provided a more 'fusion' type sushi taste. My least favourite was the rolls. They tasted dry and bland to the point that it was hard to tell what you were sampling. 

Main / Entree: 
Sablefish and Lobster Ravioli with eggplant, mushrooms and romanesco. 

I really enjoyed this entree. I though the sablefish was marinated and cooked perfectly. It was a perfect balance of sweetness and melt in your mouth smoothness. The lobster ravioli and cream sauce was amazing as well. You could really see and taste the quality ingredients that went into the ravioli with lobster meat on every bite. The accompanying vegetables were a little disappointing and very bland tasting. I felt like the romanesco and mushrooms were just blanched with hot water with no seasoning. It didn't really add to the dish, if anything took away from the other two tasty items. 

Dessert: 
Green Tea Opera Cake with Green Tea Gelato

The dessert tasted standard. I heard a lot of great things about this cake and was super excited to try it, but perhaps it was overhyped. I felt the cake part (chocolate ganache) overpowered the green tea flavour as opposed to complimenting it. But, the gelato was very delicious and pungent, which I enjoyed.

The service was great as usual. My only complaint was the fact that the women's bathroom always seems to be in disarray. I think more attention needs to be paid to it for this type of restaurant that thrives in the 'experience'. One stall was broken and there was toilet paper everywhere on the floor. 

Overall, I felt that the food was decent, but perhaps the quality is not as high when it is Winterlicious? Mop"
Enoteca Sociale,5,2019-05-23,"This place is probably a 4.5, but I'm rounding-up because I think this place needs some love from the 4 stars it currently has. 

I was flying solo and grabbed a seat at the bar, and the bartender was really helpful. Although solo, I could tell this was wonderful date restaurant as it was rather intimate. But fret not, even though I was solo, the restaurant wasn't that 'date-y' and it was lively and social(e) so it's still good for small groups. 

I only ordered 2 small plates to get a sense of the restaurant, and I was really impressed. I ordered the arancini and the rapini, and both were delicious. 

The arancini was one of the better ones I've had and that's saying something, because I have had some delicious arancini. The ones served at Enoteca Sociale had great texture, and wonderful combination of the crunchy outer crust and the soft cheese and rice inside were perfect. It was a perfect ratio of rice, cheese, and fried breading. 

The rapini was also very flavorful and had a nice level of oil and acid. They keep it in long strips and so it was rather difficult to cut with a butter knife, but that was the only drawback of 2 delicious dishes. 

Although a small sampling, I was impressed and definitely want to get back to try some of their main dishes and entrees. I can't speak to those dishes, but I can point you in the direction of some of their starters. Definitely recommend those dishes!"
Baretto Caffe,5,2019-11-08,"I have been wanting to come to this spot since my last visit to Toronto based on their offerings, the Yelp reviews and pictures. Today was the day. 

The location is a bit strange behind an office building where you need to enter into the office building to get to the cafe. Once you are there the service is very attentive, the food is wonderful and really authentic. The seating area is very quiet and just a refreshing break from the congestion of the city. 

I took my sister and brother in law who are locals and they will be back often based on our experience.

Thank you for starting our day with a joyfully experience."
Chop Chop,2,2019-04-05,We ordered through Uber eats. The driver was quick and really friendly. The food was hot and not too expensive. Otherwise the food was not our favorite. Out of everything we enjoyed the spring rolls the best. The rest of the food was pretty bland and not a lot of flavor. It was fulfilling and we were hungry so it wasn't the worst thing.
La Carnita,3,2018-12-16,"There's lots of mixed reviews for this restaurant. Glowing reviews versus one that speak of terrible service. My review errs on the side of the not so good. I'd say 2.5 stars for me.

Are all Mexican restaurants so dim? It seems that the ones I've been to are always so dark and hard to see. In terms of price it's on the pricey side. My friend took me to a food truck in LA and it was either $1 or $1.50 per taco. I suppose you're paying for the atmosphere and sit down service but ~$6/taco is quite the surcharge. I'll give them that the carne asada taco was tasty but in my opinion that still doesn't justify paying so much per taco. They're small so it's not like you're going to have just 1.

I saw horchata on the menu and decided to try it here. It was very watered down. I didn't taste any cinnamon at all either. definitely not worth $4. 

The server told us that they want to be the best fried chicken place in Toronto. I'd say that they have quite a ways to go until they can claim that title. Perhaps it was just the pieces I got but the skin was soft and not crispy. It was also kinda bland without slathering it in sauce. Turns out the dip that we had with the chips was a better accompaniment for the fried chicken instead of the sauce it came with. Go figure. 

That's a lot of negatives that I've listed. The positives are that our server was great and available when we needed her, the atmosphere was good, we were comfortable and didn't feel rushed to finish our meal. Although, paying for our bill took some time. Maybe the person taking payment didn't realize we were ready to pay because our server came back around after about 15 min of us waiting to speed up the process. 

I'd spent almost $30 and left unsatisfied with value for money and felt like I hardly had anything to eat."
La Marquesita,3,2019-04-08,"4 stars for their crispy beef tacos, 2 stars for their very greasy veggie tacos. I prefer their crispy tacos to those at the Haam.

Honestly, their crispy tacos are pretty solid, but they need serve it yourself salsa to really bring them together and put them over the top. I'll probably bump this to 4 stars once they do let customers add their own salsa.

Otherwise, you'll still likely get better tacos than you're expecting from this tiny shack across from the Eaton Centre."
Swatow Restaurant,4,2019-06-14,"Toronto has an authentic Chinatown. Though not quite as vibrant as San Francisco or New York, we found a very good place to eat. 

The won ton soup was plentiful and filled with fresh bok choy and too many noodles to eat. Three of us shared this. Then we had the general tao chicken which was tasty but not overly spicy. And had a sliced beef over rice dish which was also flavorful. 

All in all much better than we can get in Detroit. We enjoyed the meal and would come back but wouldn't feel like we had to come back."
Bamboo Kitchen,5,2018-03-26,Much better quality than other Chinese food restaurants in the East end outside of East Chinatown. Chili chicken is nice
Artisan Plus,5,2019-11-28,"Yum! I've been searching for a place that satisfy my cravings for nice, thick... biang biang noodles!! Great value and taste that's all you need, you gotta eat here.

It's just so inconvenient to make these Xi'an hand pulled noodles at home and hard to find a place in Toronto that delivers thick noodles in the right texture and comforting flavours. Tomato and egg and eggplant is not something you typically find with noodle dishes and just love the tomato/egg as it's a staple comfort food in Chinese cuisine. 

This place has it all in terms of what I look for in a good noodle joint, hand pulled, great flavors, GREAT value and complimentary ingredients. They don't skimp out the veggies or give bad cuts of meat like some places do. Love the pork belly. 

I tried the biang biang and beef rib soup noodle. I say the biang biang is a must try when you first come. Beef rib soup noodle is just not as good.

I also try Liang pi combo, so odd that it comes with specifically orange soda. Is orange soda the best complimentary drink? The meat bun, orange soda and cold noodles all together is only $11~. What a bargain!

Quickly added to my favs!"
Donatello Restaurant,3,2018-12-04,"Best crab ravioli & grilled calamari I've ever had! Friends ordered the veal marsala, a chicken special and fettuccine cream (don't remember the names) and they were flavourless. The restaurant is too cramped so it's hard to enjoy a meal without bumping elbows into the servers. Service however was really good. Would come back just for the ravioli & calamari."
El Charro,5,2020-03-05,"This place is authentic (in my non mexican opinion) and damn good. I like the creepy washrooms in the basement that add to the ""hole in the wall"" feeling of this restaurant. I think three tacos for 10$ is a good deal. The Mexican sausage and steak were delicious as they had these little pieces of juicy fat. They have different levels of spicy sauces yummm."
Khao San Road,3,2019-09-24,"Food 4, 4.5 stars
Not a 5 with the price, average sized portion, about 20 a plate, tad pricey.. place is packed, charge what they want!

ONE STAR for interior; ridiculously loud, annoying.  People hot/sweating, packed everyday, maybe a little AC?
Tight, tight corridors; poor staff, everyone in the way.  Minimal room to maneuver.
Never returning, I'd suggest for those interested; TAKE OUT!"
98 Aroma,5,2019-05-11,"Really good food, plus good service. It had become one of my go to places when I'm with friends and have a hard time picking a restaurant."
Sichuan Garden Restaurant,3,2017-10-01,"I am a bit torn by this rating. I would give it a 2.5 if I could. I was a little freaked out my the fruit flies hovering around my table but I put it aside. Hopefully the kitchen is clean, but what can I do about it, nothing. I order two dishes I get at Trizest, a Sichuan place near my home, in Michigan. The Cold Sichuan noodles were good but a bit bland. The portion size of the small would easily feed two. The Ma Po tofu was again, a large portion. It did seem to lack the Sichuan peppercorns and the mouth numbing effect. I'm a fan of salty but it was way salty. I think it was the preserved black beans that put it over the top. My dish didn't come with rice so I had to order some on the side. All in all it was good, but I wouldn't make a pilgrimage here."
Agio,3,2019-02-15,"Foods were good and we had a good time dining as a group. Unfortunately, nearing the end of our meal, we got yelled at by the chef for being late for our reservation. 
We apologize but he kept on going which makes it awkward for us and leaves a sour taste on otherwise a nice evening out with friends and good meal."
Ho Ho Barbeque,3,2018-02-27,"FOOD: 2.5 stars
PRICE: 4 stars
SERVICE: 4 stars

I came here after reading many good reviews about how tasty their food was.  I looked for something to grab it home after picking up my adorable macarons at DaanGo Cake lab.


We ordered 3 boxes of meat on rice; one with roasted pork, another one was roasted duck and the last one was bbq pork.  It comes with either tofu or vegetable on the side.  We only chose vegetable because my husband isn't a fan of tofu. You can also choose to have either a drink or soup along with your meal too.  The price for bbq meat on rice is around $6.50-$8.50.  Isn't it a good deal?  The staff was very nice and friendly.  I wasn't sure if they were the owners or not. I really couldn't tell.  I don't live in the area and it was my first time here. 

The portion was generous however the meat was quite dry.  The bbq pork was ok.  It was better than the roasted pork and roasted duck.  The roasted pork wasn't crispy as I expected and there was little meat on the roasted duck.  

As all above, the food I ordered was mediocre or maybe it wasn't my day.  Anyway, the price was good.  Three meals were only $22.50!  It's pretty good right!?"
King’s Tacos,5,2020-01-15,"This year has really started off well for me (at least in terms of food haha)

King Tacos is a family-run Mexican restaurant on St. Clair West. We ordered Gaucamole, Chicken Tacos and Beef Bistec Tacos. 

You do get free fresh chips and sauces with all orders, which I think is super! 

The whole concept is amazing. You get FRESH tacos in a taco box, you assemble it yourself, which I think is nice. You also get 3 different sauces to add to your tacos and you can add cheese too! 

It's very authentic and similar to how it is in Mexico! It's quite a large restaurant with lots of seating. The only thing I would say it as it's family run, it's a little slow. They're definitely hospitable and friendly but the service is a little slow, even for a weekend lunch. I won't ding them for this because the flavours of everything we ordered was scrumptious. Large portions don't hurt either ;)"
Artisan Plus,3,2019-09-03,"Artisan Plus received a great amount of hype upon opening on IG and I've been waiting to try it since.

AMBIANCE: 5/5
The store itself is small but functional. The seating is very well designed with ample room in between each table and each chair has it's own cubby to leave purses/shopping bags in. The decoration itself gives the restaurant a really nice modern, chic vibe and great for IG pics!

FOOD: 3/5
I ordered their famous YoPo Biang Biang Mian with Beef: this comes with scrambled eggs, tomatoes, carrots, zucchini, organic cloud ear mushroom, five spice tofu, edamame, and potato. The dish came with thick ribbon noodles which were THICK, chewy, and filling.
The plate was okay but a little underwhelming from how much hype was given. The sauce was a little plain and I was expecting more of a savory flavor. Because there was such a variety I believe they only put a little of each so it makes the dish seem insubstantial. 

SERVICE: 5/5
The service is really attentive here. The server was friendly and advised of spice levels of the dish (my friends CANNOT handle spicy). Water was always refilled and the food came out hot and fast. Bills came quickly and easily split.

OVERALL: 3/5
I feel like this was a solid but average experience. I'll be back in the future to try other things on the menu!"
Donatello Restaurant,5,2018-04-14,"I was craving gnocchi so my friend took me here for ny birthday. It was extremely classy, even the exterior of the building was quaint. The server was extremely attentive and even used a special scrapper to clean the crumbs off our table after eating the crunchy bruschetta. Although there were many fancy looking appetizers, I had to choose the bruschetta as its a simple classic that I love. I tried it with the olive oil and balsamic vinegar that they had on the table as well. It was so flavourful!
The gnocchi was fresh with an amazing sauce. The server sprinkled cheese and pepper. I wish I had asked for more cheese and pepper (it looked like a lot of pepper but I actually did not taste much since it was so finely grinded).
My friend got the cheese filled ravioli. I was expecting it to be cheesy but it was a harder, more crumbly dry cheese instead. The sauce was light. It was yummy but not as flavourful as the gnocchi I felt.
Overall, I would reccomend this place to others and would love to come again to try something else!"
Nodo Restaurant,2,2019-08-30,"New owner!!
Was my favourite place in the hood but noticed that the owner ship has changed and quality of the food has deteriorated. 
Less food and high priced."
Cinco Mexican Restaurant,5,2018-05-07,"This is, hands-down, the best mexican food place in Toronto! And I would know!  I live in Cuidad de Mexico, DF, and have travelled (with locals) pretty much every corner of Estados Unidos de Mexico!

In Toronto I've tried every single mexican restaurant in the core (no suburbs), including Los Colibris (high end), Caballito, Grand Electric (fusion), etc. etc.

NONE of the above places are as good as this one. None, even the pricey ones! 

Cinco is a very small restaurant and it gets really busy around brunch on weekends. They have a special brunch menu, but their regular one is also available.  The best items on the menu are tacos and they come in two varieties: specialty (lots of goodies) and regular (simple).  Specialty tacos are around $8 - two are enough for the average guy (150lbs), while the regular are around $5 and you'd probably need three to feel full. They also have a 'salsa bar' with different heat salsas - but they are all sooo goood!!!

The service is good but not servile.  When it gets busy sometimes they forget stuff (no free chips), but just remind them. The flavors of the pork belly and specialty pork are to die for!  I pity the people who don't eat the tastiest meat out there because they are missing on an amazing flavor and texture experience.  The chicken is also good, but the pork is waaay better.  In DF, pork Tacos al Pastor are the main street food, and here they are replicated almost exactly.

Now a word for vegans (one nasty review down the screen, scroll down, you'll find it) - JUST KEEP MOVING!  This is not a restaurant for you!  I can't believe the lady who wrote the review ordered the tacos without meat AND without cheese!!!??? What's left? NOTHING - that's what!  The slow cooked meat with it's juices and mixed with the melted cheese, both soaking into the corny (see what I did there) tortilla is the essence of the food experience here.  During my time in Mexico I didn't meet a single local vegetarian/vegan.  That should tell you about the essence of the cuisine. 

Do yourself a favor and come to this restaurant and eat the dishes as they are written in the menu (no substitutions!) - your taste buds will thank you for hours."
Yummy Yummy Dumplings,3,2020-02-28,"Went there because craving for dumplings and saw good reviews online. Their shop is a bit old style but that isn't a matter.

Service: Their understandings of English is really low. I know they're Asian but still communication is key especially running a business. Realized most asian restaurants nowadays required customers to write on a paper for ordering

Food: Food was delicious! Handmade and freshly made to order. Like the chewiness of the noodles and the thinness of the dumplings.

However, they gave me 11 dumplings rather than a dozen. I didn't give a tip because of the poor communication and missing food but they complained about that :/"
Quetzal,4,2018-11-16,"Went on a Sunday, early evening, walked in and ate at the bar. 

My friend and I were impressed with the bartender who was great at describing the food menu and great with suggestions. We thought he had better service than Alo bar at Yorkville. We also had Alo / Aloette staff sitting beside us. They, of course, had industry treatment, super friendly to each other. 

Food was good. Ordered the Masa with the mushrooms with it, enjoyed the salsas with it. The Lamb melts in your mouth, very fatty so you really need the right salsa / acid to go with it. The mushroom was solid as most reviewers had said. The broth was very flavourful but there is something gritty and slightly bitter at the end on the bottom of the bowl.  We ordered two desserts, one was a chocolate and pear sauce pairing. Not heavy nor too sweet. The second one was a daily special, they call it a Nutella bread with hot chocolate. This hot chocolate is NOT thick, but had a the right spice like in a chai that balances the bread that is a bit on the dry side but the homemade nutella inside was divine!

The atmosphere is fun. The decor is amazing. The staff was really good."
La Carnita,3,2020-01-07,"3.5 stars!

I came here for a pitcher of sangria while I waited for DaiLo to open for dinner service. The staff wasn't the most welcoming and the sangria tasted like straight-up soda. I can't really speak to the food since I wasn't planning on dining here but people poured in right at opening time so that must be a good sign. 

Maybe the food here is phenomenal but I wasn't obsessed with my bar experience. Just ok."
King’s Tacos,2,2017-10-07,"A disappointment for vegetarians. I'd read about King's tacos on Yelp and on some Facebook discussions and expected to be pleasantly surprised by their home-style serving style and innovative veggie options. Sadly that did not happen. 

We ordered the veggie tacos and were excited to try the welcome chips and salsas. Turns out at least one of the salsas has chicken stock - why!? - and the rest were just watery meh. 

The veggie tacos were fine at best. Pretty oily and just boring. And, finding a meat piece in the veggie mix was the final straw. Definitely won't be back and still in search of a decent veggie taco in Toronto. Tips welcome!"
Asian Legend,3,2017-12-11,"We had a team member who was leaving work to pursue his dream job and we took him out for lunch. This place was suggested and quickly liked by a few.   

The restaurant managers/owners generally I think underestimate the power of mentioning a bit more details on the menu or at least a server who is knowledgeable about ingredients. In the absence of information I went the safest route of ordering a plain congee and a steamed bun. My order would easily have been more than double if the right information was provided. 

So on the limited items that I could have, my review is not a review per se. One cannot mess up a Congee and a bun.

However the food did not arrive all together and out of respect for others, all of us had to wait. Which resulted in food going cold. 

The congee and bun were as good as they can be"
Harmoney Chinese Restaurant,3,2019-02-05,"I am a huge fan of Xian style Biang Biang Mein. I haven't found a place in Toronto that makes this. Therefore, when I found a picture of this dish on their ad outside I had to try it. It is strange that I could not find a yelp review. However, there were plenty of google reviews on this restaurant.

It's own by a couple and I feel they gear their restaurant to Chinese speaking customers. Their English is quite weak. I ordered the Biang Biang noodles and steam dumplings. I wrote the number down and wrote the English name on the paper. The lady had to clarify what I meant with another customer. They make their dumplings from scratch and have a pretty big menu.

I do have to admit their Biang Biang noodles and their dumplings are not the best I had. However, they are cheaper than other places around Spadina. What I did not enjoy was one of the owner/cook was clearing his throat alot during the time I was there which was very gross because you hope he did not spit on your food. Really, clearing your throat should be done in the privacy of your own home and not your business where they are customers.

The owners are nice but they are more friendly to Chinese speaking customers because they can communicate with them. If you cannot speak Chinese they will serve you but you will be ignored most of the time."
La Marquesita,5,2019-04-25,"I recently visited La Marquesita, and I have to say I really enjoyed their taquito, they lightly pass the tortilla through oil (makes it a little crunchy) and the filling for the beef is incredibly delicious -- spice levels can also be adjusted to your own taste. Whilst I haven't tried much else on the menu, the one thing I did have was pretty legit. I'd put it above the beef taco at 7 lives which is currently top rated in Toronto right now. Looking forward to going back! 

If you're hesitant to try due to limited reviews, I hope my suggestion urges you to try!"
Swatow Restaurant,3,2019-08-22,"The food here is amazing. I understand why previous reviews mentioned it being an OG spot and authentic taste overall. They specialized in more FuZhou cooking but it's good cause it doesn't have the oily and greasy taste afterwards. We enjoyed everything we ordered and the portions were a great size for what we needed that day. They cook really good snow pea leaves, probably one of the best I've had in Chinese restaurants. So definitely no complaints about the food at all, it's totally worth it but CASH ONLY! 

The only reason why I'm giving it a 3 is because they don't have the best table service (which seemed to be the case in the Toronto Chinatown area). The waiting staff look really annoyed at you and the lack of hospitality is not what I'm used to when I go to restaurants. Maybe the workers are being overworked and not compensated enough, just don't let it rub you the wrong way if you want to try the food, it does come out fast and I did really enjoy it."
Blu Ristorante,3,2019-09-15,"I'm really not trying to be passive aggressive but honestly, this is my interpretation of this restaurant and the patrons who have rated it so highly.  I feel it received the acclamation it has (voted one of most romantic restaurants in the city and all the 5 star ratings) because (a)  it's in Yorkville and (b) guests MAY mostly include those that don't dine out in the city as often.  The ones that usually do on special occasions

Look, this city has an abundance of fantastic restaurants led by a generation of daring, creative and exciting chefs.  So when I come to Blu, that is a self proclaimed ""fine dining"" restaurant, I'm expecting everything to be elevated.  Not everyone can be Alo, I get it, but it's the expectation that's set which I'm comparing the experience to.  

For starters we got carpaccio, tuna tartar and the octopus. The carpaccio was your typical combination of flavors that I can recite in my sleep (meet, Capers, some creamy sauce, truffle oil ,arugula for garnish.  Maybe not exactly but you know what I mean).  The tartar was tasty from what I recall but the ""octopus"" omg.  First off they seemed to be 2 squid tentacles, very small and burnt.  On one side is a pineapple chutney of sorts and on the other side is an eggplant purée.  It's octopus! Can't really mess that up and don't ever pair is with anything so overpowering. The eggplant ok fine maybe but the Indian flavors did not complement the fish at all.  

On to main course.  My wife had the wild boar ragu.  First couple of bites and you're thinking wow this is delicious but I could see where my wife was coming from when she said the sweetness in that dish is just too much.  You almost get sick of it near the end.  But she ate most of it and whatever it was fine.  I had the seafood pasta.  It was good.  Fresh seafood, pasta and light olive oil sauce.  Nothing extra just what you'd expect I guess.  

The ambiance is great and we loved the service.  They have a nice drink menu and prices were what you'd expect for Yorkville.  

Overall is was a great night and my wife and I didn't leave the restaurant angry.  We enjoyed the food but again it's setting the expectation.  Everything we ate tasted like how they should and we've had those same flavors many times before.  but we were expecting more imagination with flavors and presentation.  Unfortunately Blu didn't deliver"
Hotopia Downtown,1,2019-11-08,"Nice staff
Simple interior
About $20 for king pao w rice; restaurants love to add $$$$ for the rice, they know it goes with rice, so charge more, seems unfair.
It is definitely hot. Felt like CRAP hour(s) later.
Hard on the stomach, I like hot, this was too greasy and doesn't sit well.
Did I mention 4 hrs later..
Not so good!
Bad aftertaste and guts are mad at me."
Buca,5,2019-08-16,"Dinner for 4 on Thursday - Summer.  We were able to get in but highly recommend you to make reservation.  Two hosts, very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful.  We were seated in the comunal table (sits 8, but no one else joined). Great view to the kitchen.

Ambience is modern, dressy.  Great for special occasions.  You will feel you are in a restaurant in Italy.  Big open floor but somehow allows for intimate conversations.  Most people were enjoying one another and their food.

Prosciutto and selection of 3 cheeses were very tasty.  Prosciutto directly from Parma.  Best cheese of the 3 was Parmigiano (other two were Peccorino and Mozarella di Buffala).

For entrees:  Capeletti was our favorite dish- pasta filled w ricotta, lemon sauce and mushrooms.  Maccheroncini was a close second call- tomato sauce was so tasty and natural!.  Pomodoro e Tartufo pizza was done to perfection.  I noticed other reviews calling the weird shape of their pizzas.  Nothing weird about that.  Perfectly shaped and done Italian style.  Again, we felt we were in Italy.

Desserts: Torta Amalfi (almond based cake w fruit) was very tasty, recommend to share between 2 or 3.  Their gelatos were fluffy and flavorful.

Lastly, as expected, they had a very good selection of wines.  Their Italian list is very extensive.  We opted for a bottle of Nebbiolo and it paired very well w our dinner."
Agio,3,2019-12-05,"The food was enjoyable, the service was friendly, and the price was reasonable.

However, though my party of four were the only ones in the restaurant aside from another couple, it took very long for our food to come out. I can't imagine how long it would take if it was a full house.  Based on other reviews here, this seems like an ongoing problem at Agio.

The decor is also a mismatch to what they're trying to be... a restaurant that serves high end Italian cuisine. It's basically a hole in the wall here, well below average in all aspects (floor, tables, decor, walls, washrooms, etc)"
Lai Wah Heen,3,2019-07-09,"Dinner:
Peking Duck, 2 courses
Spicy Shrimp hot pot with vermicelli
Shrimp with black bean sauce

I had not been to Lai Wah Heen in several years, until recently.

The two course peking duck was definitely better than in a normal restaurant. I could tell that the flour wraps were of much higher quality than normal. Perhaps made fresh at the restaurant? 
They serve it with the duck, cucumber, green onion already on the wrap, then you can add the sauce on your own.
The second course was a pretty standard version of the lettuce wraps.

Spicy Shrimp Hot Pot with Vermicelli was excellent. I would order this dish again without question. The clear vermicelli noodles are a great compliment to the spicy sauce and large shrimp.

Shrimp with black bean sauce was good, but did not stick out as much.

Overall, it was a good meal, but the prices are prohibitive."
Mi Taco Taqueria,5,2020-02-09,"Outstanding tacos,  great atmosphere, and most importantly, phenomenal tacos. The tacos had a generous  amount of filling & the toppings were super fresh!"
Mexico Lindo,5,2019-03-09,"Amazing!! Family run, authentic, delicious food, competitive pricing and great portions! Love that they offer courtesy chips and homemade salsa! They earned our business and we will definitely be returning. Mexitaco has lost our business. Overpriced and portions are a rip off. This is way better! You won't regret it!"
Harmoney Chinese Restaurant,1,2019-05-03,"When we arrived the restaurant was empty and silent. We were seated at a table that was sticky and bits of food left on the table. We ordered the Chinese burgers, pork soup dumplings and cold noodles. The buns were stale, the noodles were excessively greasy and had a weird texture, and the pork dumpling meat was fatty. After leaving the restaurant, both my girlfriend and I felt very uneasy, she threw up immediately. I originally decided to come to this restaurant based on the reviews but after my experience I would not recommend this to anyone."
Artisan Plus,3,2019-07-28,"Relatively new noodle spot that opened up downtown just at Bay and Dundas. Came by with a few coworkers for lunch and the consensus was that it was okay. 

Even though Artisan plus was packed when we arrived. We were lucky and was able to get seated fairly quickly for a party of 6. 

We were seated on the high top right in front of the kitchen and got to witness the staff in action. It still amazes me how efficient the kitchen works, it's a well oiled machine. 

I ordered the appetizer trio, pork bun, and clam mashi. The appetizer trio was a combo of enoki, bean curd, and tripe. Of the 3 the tripe stood out the most. The bean curd and enoki mushroom were okay at best. The trio comes with dipping sauce that tasted very similar to a peanut sauce. 

The pork bun was shared among the group and we found that although the pork was really flavourful and moist, the bun itself was a tad on the dry side. Not the good kind either. It's worth a try but I wouldn't be ordering this again if I visited again. 

The clam mashi was amazing! I've gotta say I could have done with without the other two items on the menu but the clam mashi is a must. Be warned, it's a little spicy. I would say out of 10, would be about a 7 on my scale. Not to the point where the heat was unbearable and unenjoyable. It definitely lingers and I found myself going through water pretty quickly. The clams were declines in the dish and there was quite a few in there to enjoy. This was my first time having mashi and I'm now a big fan of that."
La Chingada,4,2019-09-10,"We came here for dinner and had a really positive experience. We ordered the platter and two tacos to share. Both of our tacos were great and the platter had three types of meat (two different pork and beef which did contain gluten) and different vegetables and sides for us to put on our corn tortillas. 

We found this to be plenty of food for two people and it was really good.

The Service was a little on the slow side but if you don't mind waiting, it's definitely worth checking out."
Agio,2,2019-07-27,"I came on a Monday around 5pm with two other people. We ordered 3 dishes (ravioli, lobster pasta and shrimp with veggies) and spent over 100$. Here is a short pros and cons list: 

Pros: 
- The food is good 
- The chef gave us some bread with butter, vinegar and olive oil on the side. He also gave us some baked zucchini as an appetizer. 
- He seems knowledgeable about Italian cuisine. He said that he cooked in Italy for 7 years. 
- a lot of street parking nearby

Cons: 
- The restaurant smells like cat. The odour was very strong. 
- The bathroom is in the basement with a very very low ceiling. It reminded me of the bathrooms one would expect to see at a campsite, so it's very usable, but lots of bugs. 
- The decor is very outdated. 
- Too expensive. The ravioli dish was composed of 4 big ravioli. The lobster pasta was also a fair portion. The shrimp with veggies was my main issue. It cost over 25$ if I recall correctly. It was 3 shrimp with a handful or two of steamed veggies. For the price we paid, we expected more. After we finished our meal, we were still not fully satisfied. We ended up going somewhere else and eating more. 

In my opinion, the cons greatly outweigh the pros. There are many other cleaner Italian restaurants that serve much more equally delicious food for the same price."
King’s Tacos,4,2019-05-21,"Tacos! Love tacos and loved the flavour of the fillings for the tacos here. 

The only thing I wish they did is being able to mix the tacos choices so you could try more of them without going overboard with the meal sizes. Also feel like because of this the prices are a little more than some other taco spots. 

However overall the tacos are great! Had an enjoyable experience. Side note: the churros are massive."
GB Hand-pulled Noodles,3,2019-10-06,"This was my first time ever getting hand-pulled noodles. The broth was lovely - reminded me of pho. I ordered the super thin noodles, & it seemed almost over cooked as they were too soft. I suppose this might just be because they're super fresh, so there's no way to make them more al dente. I found because it's hand pulled, the size consistency of the noodles were off. There were thicker noodles mixed in, so it threw me off. This is most likely all PREFERENCE based.. but the beef was GREAT & the flavours of the broth and addition of green onions and cilantro."
Levetto,5,2020-01-27,"Wow! Amazing food! Great big, filling portions, made fresh, and piping hot. Definitely check this place out. The reviews don't lie or exaggerate! Will certainly be back! That's a pic of the beef ragu with perfectly cooked and freshly made rigatoni."
Dumpling House Restaurant,3,2020-01-04,"Food is good, we were craving dumplings and we came to the right place. Got a variety of steamed & pan fried dumplings. Food comes pretty quickly but I wished the place was a bit cleaner. The plastic soup spoon was stained from overuse, the condiments were obviously neve really cleaned well everyday. The worst of it though was when we went to pay the bill the lady demanded we add +$2 for tip. I have never been to a restaurant that has said that to me."
Carisma,3,2019-02-12,"I have frequently gone by this restaurant, and was curious to try it out. I dined here for a business meeting with several of my colleagues.

The ambiance and decor is elegant and romantic overall, and the staff are very welcoming and hospitable.

Carisma has been an establishment in Toronto for years, and I was eager to try it out based on recommendations.

Upon entering, I was greeted by very hospitable staff. The restaurant was entirely empty upon my arrival, which I found to be unusual given that it was peak dinner time.

Our server was attentive and knowledgeable and had great recommendations about specials that evening and the menu. 

My colleague and I decided to share the Grilled Calamari appetizer, which was quite flavorful in nature with the addition of olives and herbs. Although I didn't partake in the bread, my colleague mentioned that it was quite soft and delicious overall!

For our entrees, we ordered the SeaBass Filet which according to my companion was well-seasoned and delicious overall; another colleague asked for a 'surprise' entree and was presented with a combined dish of the gnocchi and agnolotti, which she enjoyed. My entree was the ahi tuna dish which I was excited about; however, I must admit that this was overdone. It was presented as an entire tuna steak, which was likely the issue in the cook overall, as had it been sliced tuna, there may have been more control over the cook. I had asked for it to be rare, and it was far more than well-done, and even charred on one side. 

Overall, I am glad that I tried this establishment. I commend the staff and service for their efforts."
Mariachi’s Restaurant,3,2013-10-12,"First things first: Great service! They were so polite, friendly and for the most part fast 

The margaritas were fantastic! I will definitely be back for those! However, the food left my taste buds in complete disappointment!! The appetizer was alright- everything was bland for myself and my boyfriend. 

Entrees: my boyfriend ordered the beef enchiladas. They looked fantastic and I would know, I was looking at his meal for awhile.. I was kept waiting for my chicken enchiladas for about an additional 5-10 minutes after he got his. When it finally came, my rice was cold! Not to mention? I found a hair in it. I pretty much lost my appetite right there. But I was just too hungry in the end- so I ate around my nasty rice. Again, food was bland! For Mexican food, I expect bold flavours and spices... I got none of this. Not to mention, the ""spicy"" sauce was not even a hint of spice in there. 

I gave them three stars because they were über nice and the service was good. However, this is a Mexican place I won't be visiting again for the food."
Comal y Canela,5,2019-05-05,"Three visits to this place so far, and we've gotten the enmoladas (chicken mole enchiladas) each time. The mole sauce is addictive; The blend of spices, chilis, and chocolate is rich, creamy, and balanced. 

If you're looking for the next level of shareable nachos, the asada chilaquiles is a mammoth portion of salsa poured over tortillas and topped with steak, cheese, cream, avocado, and beans on the side. 

They also have a tasty carnitas, a solid birria and pozole, along with various tacos (we liked the gobernador and the cochinita so far). 

Most of the dishes come with three types of salsa, onions, limes, and cilantro to dress your food with.

For drinks, I'd recommend the Jamaica, a hibiscus iced tea, and the Tepache, fermented pineapple juice and piloncillo. They have a lower level of sweetness, which was appreciated."
Buca,3,2019-09-30,"The pasta is really good. You can tell it's homemade once you take a bite. However, prices are quite high with portion sizes small. I ordered the duck pasta and felt I wanted more pasta but I guess it's filling but I don't think it's worth the price. I love my desserts but all their desserts were over $15 so I passed. The service was good and attentive.

They do not do separate cheques. Therefore, if you come with a large group be prepared to grab your calculators so you can split the bill easier. I'm a little annoyed that the host never checked me in with my open table reservation which resulted in a warning email from Open Table for a No Show. He did resolve it after the phone call but it was quite inconvenient to have to call the restaurant to have them fix the problem."
Stelvio,4,2019-07-06,We really enjoyed Stelvio- great Italian food and service. The waiter was also super helpful with the menu and wine pairings. The star of the night was definitely the ossobuco ristotto! It was delicious and I would definitely come back for it.
Fieramosca,3,2016-07-03,"You take the good, you take the bad, you take them both and there you have the facts of life... at Fieramosca.  (You are old like me if you know that theme song!)

Have you ever gone to a restaurant with great expectations based on reviews and left disappointed?  That was our experience.

Some call it cozy but for me the table layout in the main dining room is claustrophobically cramped.  If you want a seat on the patio on Friday or Saturday in the summer, make sure to reserve several days in advance.

Reservations are taken by phone and I will admit they were very helpful even if it did take 10 rings for them to answer... I was surprised that a restaurant in this price range did not have online reservations!

Being in a house transformed into a restaurant, the entry hallway is narrow, so if someone is going out, nobody can go in and vice versa.  

So if you are even a little claustrophobic,  be warned, you won't be comfortable here.  

The food:

Complimentary bruschetta:  A plain Pizza crust with bruschetta topping which falls off and wasn't that flavourful. Go to La Bruschetta to find out how it is meant to taste.

Caesar salad:  Crispy romaine, hints of fresh garlic and Parmesan but the dressing seemed watery and the croutons were like rocks.

Bread basket:  Now I know why the croutons are like rocks, the crust on the bread was so hard I was worried I would break a tooth, and I also found it strange to be served whole wheat bread, when I was expecting crusty Italian bread.  

Spaghetti Carbonara:   The reason we came was because Hubby was craving Carbonara and based on great reviews we thought we would try it here but he found Fieramosca's version disappointingly bland, even with extra Parmesan cheese and fresh ground pepper.  

Linguini DI Mamma Ninetta:  I love mushrooms but was surprised that there were so many in this dish... With just 3 small shrimp and a few small pieces of chicken scattered throughout, and very little garlic flavour, this dish was edible but far from great.

Tiramisu:  No coffee flavour!  I have made Tiramisu before and have had it in countless restaurants and I know the lady fingers are to be dipped in coffee before being covered in cream, and these missed the coffee altogether, and the cream here seemed to just be whipped cream, none of the yummy marscapone that I was expecting.   Libretto's Tiramisu in a jar might not be traditional in presentation but has all the flavour that Fieramosca's lacked.  My favourite dessert when done well, I left disappointed.

Lemon Sorbet:  Frozen sorbet in a scooped out lemon, menu says imported from Italy.  I actually liked it better than the sad face Tiramisu so hubby swapped with me because while he usually loves anything lemon, he found an odd aftertaste.  I joked it was the jet fumes to bring frozen sorbet from Italy but the truth is, it was the perfume worn by the woman at the table next to ours.  Thankfully she arrived as we had dessert, so our entire meal was not ruined, but the smell was so overpowering that it gave us both a headache and we wanted to get out of there fast, since with the cramped layout she was almost on top of our table.

Ladies, please don't drown yourself in perfume and go to a restaurant!  Ugh!

TL;DR - Meh. Bottom line nothing was horrible but nothing was great, which for the price was disappointing.  Not worth a second visit.

2 stars bumped to 3 because the service was good.

The search for Pasta Carbonara continues... maybe a trip to NYC or even Rome!"
Giulietta,3,2019-05-19,"Had my bday dinner at the counter seating in front of the kitchen, a great spot to watch the chef cooking the dishes. Food was great except the pasta. It's raw, not Al dente. We ordered the octopus. The portion size of each piece has a quite big difference. Wonder if they give s bigger portion for a large table. As we only had two people, we ordered the pork chop instead of the porterhouse. It's lovely cooked with cheeky pink inside. The highlight was the dessert, pine nut tart with wildflower honey and vanilla mascarpone. It's not too sweet with balanced flavour. 
The kitchen gave us a piece of choco tarte as bday cake. It's funny that the candle light was off three times as it's windy above our seats. 
I'd love to try their pizza in the future. However I doubt if I will go again coz they don't seem like to chat with asians"
Ramen Isshin,3,2020-02-19,"3.5/5
With so many ramen joints in and around Toronto, this place is just another typical ramen joint. I'm really surprised to hear many say this is their favourite ramen.
Remember to join the yelp waitlist during busy hours but service is usually speedy with quick turnarounds in table. 
Approx. $15 per bowl, portions could be larger but there is the option to add extra noodles for a few dollars."
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine,3,2019-10-18,"We ordered dim sums. They were all very good. But the service was a little slow: we had to ask twice for some tea, twice for the bill, and never got the sauce we asked for. It looks like no waiter in particular was in charge of our table."
Mariachi’s Restaurant,3,2019-02-08,Super expensive for small portions. Good wait staff and very friendly. Better off going to Barburrito not even gonna lie.
Carisma,2,2019-01-10,"Disappointed.

I came here for dinner and the experience was underwhelming overall. 

The ambience is nice. The service was adequate and efficient. However, the food was disappointing. The food wasn't bad, but just not what I expected for the price."
Buca Yorkville,3,2019-09-18,"I read a lot of good reviews about Buca and finally decided to give this top 10 restaurants in Canada a try. 

I came here with my girlfriend for dinner. The moment I came in, I felt like my voice was buried in the noisy environment immediately. It was as noisy as a sports bar and not a good place for chatting. My friend and I had to shout really loud at each other. I can't say I enjoyed the ambiance at all.

We ordered the fish salami platter to share, which came with squid ink bread. The bread looked interesting but taste was just average. For the salami, we both liked the octopus. The spicy flavoured pork blood salami was interesting to me too. 

For main, I had the duck pasta and my friend had the lobster pasta. It took us an hour to wait for the main dish though. We saw people sitting next to us got their food first when they came in later. The duck pasta was very chewy and very tasty (though a little bit salty). The duck had a tuna salad texture which was quite interesting. My friend enjoyed the lobster pasta in general but she didn't like the fact that the noodle being too thin and soft (it's personal preference, though I agree with her). The portion of the food was small but good enough to feed two small eaters.

In general, the food quality was good but missed the wow factor.  Service was average and it was a bit pricy for the overall experience. A 3.5 star rounded down. I will not consider coming back any time soon."
Artisan Plus,3,2019-08-23,"Another month has come and gone and here we are in the heart of Toronto just doing our thing. We've walked by Artisan Plus many time and we finally gave it a try. This place was buzzing with people around the lunch hour however the wait for a table for two wasn't very long. We waited may be 5 mins.

As this was our first visit we wanted to try a few of the appetizers and different noodles dishes. As such for the apps, we ordered the Artisan Pork Jia Mo which is handcraft artisan bread with chopped braised pork belly and gravy. The braised pork belly was quite tasty however it did get quite messy because of the gravy. We also tried the Shuan Tofu Sheet which was made of fresh tofu sheet mixed with bean sprouts, shredded red pepper, scallion, gourmet chilli, peanut and sesame sauce. This dish had the very slightest numbing spice. However this dish was slightly on the oily side and the tofu sheet were too long.

For our mains, I tried the Famous Yo Po Biang Mian which was ribbon noodle, sauteed tomato, scramble egg, cauliflower, potato, carrot, organic cloud ear mushroom, edamame, grilled zucchini, paparika, and vinegrette. The ribbon noodle was super long which made eating the noodle slightly difficult. However the flavours were different and interesting. Nothing that really made my taste buds dance. There was no numbing spice to this dish. However if you don't eat spicy on a regular basis I wouldn't recommend this dish. My husband tried the Wok Cumin Che Mian with Spring Lamb. Surprisingly the Lamb wasn't super gamey. Again the noodles were all super long and the flavour was okay. However, I still want to try their noodle soup one day. 

The service was on the ball. The waitress was always around in case you needed them. Than again the restaurant wasn't super large. There were probably around 40 seats."
La Vecchia Ristorante,3,2018-08-29,"My family and I decided to choose La Vecchia for my mini wedding dinner, as my cousin had recommended it to us so we decided to have a go and try it out. 

The place had a very nice atmosphere, very nice with cute decors. The food was pretty good, it was flavourful with a good portion size and at a reasonable price. 

Our server just seemed like he didn't want to be there. Maybe he was too busy? Or had a rough day? So I kept it positive, didn't mention anything until my other family members almost everyone noticed as well. It was my dinner night where as I was busy talking to my family members so I've missed when he was offering cheese to the pastas. I apologized and asked if he was able to bring the cheese back again, never came back with the cheese. Overall just got a very bad vibe. We had another younger server come by to collect our plates and he had a much better attitude and was certainly polite. 

I've also told the server if we could do the bill 4 ways, it was my fault I meant everyone to themselves and asked politely if he was able to change it. The response I got was ""no it has already been done and can't change it."" Left me with such a terrible feeling to my gut that now everyone overpaid for what they haven't ordered. It was my fault I'll take it but correct me if I'm wrong? The bill can't be redone? Anyways to the end of our dinner, the server all of a sudden became friendly as the bills were being handed out. 

It was certainly a day to remember, but to keep it positive I just let it go and remembered the good food and great conversations with my family members."
Sichuan Garden Restaurant,2,2018-08-17,"Sweet and sour soup was good. Dumplings were good.  Our meals were bleh. Had Tsao chicken, which looked very nice but was more deep fried pieces than chunks of chicken.  My spouse had chicken with ginger and scallions which he enjoyed. A friend had some beef dish that was indescribable."
98 Aroma,5,2019-07-01,"This restaurant has a very dedicate environment. The bricks on the wall are very beautiful. The food was delivered literally within 8mins after the order placed. The owner is so friendly and considerable. He stopped us for placing more orders because the portion of the food is so large. Moreover,the price is good. Also, they have free delivery when you order more than$30 before tax. Great option when you considering to throw a party."
Los Guaca-Moles,1,2019-06-21,"I rarely ever review restaurants but this was extraordinarily mediocre. Fish stunk, guacamole was too hot (no flavour, just heat) and the service was slow. Don't bother"
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine,2,2017-12-17,"Last week, I decided to get take out from a nearby restaurant. They said it would take twenty minutes, so I decided to walk around instead of waiting at the restaurant. I had killed some time and by the time I had looped around, I thought hey maybe I can grab one of my favorite treats as dessert. Dynasty was right there, so I went upstairs, proceeded to the counter, looked at their priceless* dim sum menu and ordered one order of the steamed egg yolk custard buns.

I said priceless with an * because I wanted to explain that it didn't have a price next to the items... Not because there menu is super precious. Boy did I ever experience sticker shock. Yes, I do remember Dynasty is over priced and the food is average here. But when I paid over $10 for three tiny buns...I couldn't help but think: didn't I pay just four dollars for three of these, but slightly larger ones, at Rol San a few weeks ago? 

Okay, so maybe the quality is why it's priced higher, I thought. So after eating amazing Indian food for dinner, I dug into the custard buns. The filing is kinda dry... Atop of this, there's some weird film/coating around the ""custard""/yolk. I assume it's edible, because it's in all three, and I ate it. But if I had to compare it against other custard buns that I've had... I'd much prefer a creamy custard instead of something dried up. I don't think of custards as something dried up ever.

There was a time when the buns were good here... Years ago. Its a shame because the other items in the menu here really are average and over priced."
Miku,4,2019-10-20,"Really delish sushi but OMG it's expensive.

I love sushi and I always try to find a great deal (not bang for your buck!).

The place truly is stunning and the service is excellent and the sushi is REALLY good but I wouldn't go back because the prices are very steep.
I guess you are paying for the real estate (situated in a beautiful waterfront location).

You can easily walk down the street and find quality sushi thats a fraction of the price. 

I highly recommend going here with a group of friends as this allows you to try and sample lots of different types of sushi, sashimi and other dishes that might seem interesting on the menu.

I had the 'Miki Signature Selection' which is what they are known for (Aburi Oshi)."
Ho Ho Barbeque,5,2018-04-21,"I went on a Friday late afternoon, and the staffs were eating. They quickly greeted me and got up to ask what I wanted to get. It was a surprisingly awesome experience at this small Chinese bbq shop!

I order 2 items combo rice of roasted pork and bbq pork, as well as half a duck and it came out to be a little over $20 including tax. What a steal for the quality and portion! While I was waiting, one of the staff offered me to sample their bbq pork..what great service!

I wish I lived close by and I'll definitely patron more often!"
7 Numbers Restaurant,2,2017-02-05,"I can't believe there are such high ratings for 7 numbers. I had high expectations for this place before coming due to the reviews. But it was about a 2.5 imho.

Shared the following with hubby...

Arugula salad with red pepper and goat cheese $12
- This was the best dish of the evening (sad isn't it? It was just a salad). I liked it as the goat cheese was part of the dressing. The red pepper was delish but wish the portion was bigger. A tad small for $12

Veal Lasagne - Lasagne with fresh-made pasta sheets, fresh ground veal, mozzarella, and housemade sauce $12.75 (large)
- Our friends ordered a small variation of this and honestly perhaps we should have ordered the small as well. It looked around the same size except it was on a slightly larger plate. There was too much pasta and sauce and too little meat. My friend called her small bowl a snack size pasta. Very saucy. That ""homemade"" sauce seems to make a repeat with a lot of dishes... But it wasn't that impressive. Tasted like something from a can. 

Meatballs - Big meatballs stuffed with mozzarella, smothered in sauce $13
- I didn't like this at all and let my hubby eat most of it. There was only a small pinky tip size mozzarella bit in it. Wasn't even served hot. Way too much sauce. I ended up dipping bread with it.

As for service, the server who served us was very polite but the general manager Tom? (glasses with plaid shirt) was super rude. Three people could not attend last minute and he said something like if I had known, I would have removed this table long ago (they attached another small table to one end). I think he could have handled the situation a lot better. Thanks for denting the mood of a friend's birthday. We noticed Tom kept giving our table dirty looks as well. At least the food came pretty quickly and our server always made sure things were ok. 

Not coming back again. No one was full and we got wings afterwards."
Dumpling House Restaurant,4,2019-04-16,"Really good food, but woefully underprepared for the dinner time rush. Very small, cramping area. They are trying to get everyone through as fast as possible and want you to order right away which is understandable but they also dont make effective use of their space which hurts them and their staff is kind of running around lost.

The dumplings are, however, 5 star. The food is wonderful, fresh, and made to order. Highly recommended but I would advise going at off hours."
Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant,4,2019-11-26,"Came here with a group of my friends. This is definitely a great place to take someone who isn't from toronto. The mountain of lobsters makes for a great photo op! But not only does it make for great IG photos the food is also very good here! 

For a table of 8 people we got the lobster and king crab combo that was cooked in 3 ways. I definitely recommend having it cooked different ways otherwise just eating a 30 lb lobster just fried will get tiring and boring fairly fast. We got it cooked fried, steamed stir fried but I must say my favourite was the fried and the soy glazed one! So flavourful and yummy. 

They give you gloves to eat with so you don't have to dirty your hands. The food comes very quickly. Our table barely had enough room for everything. The meal also came with fish and fried rice. The fried rice was okay but tbh we were all too focused on the good stuff. 

We had a lot of left overs and the meal definitely could have fed at least 3-4 more people. It was a very expensive dinner. The combo itself was $1088 if I remembered correctly. 

Service was okay. Parking is a mess there! Definitely so early to get a spot."
Magical Taste of China,5,2020-01-17,Totally delicious (and fast!). We live in Chinatown and go out a lot and this is our new favourite spot.
Como En Casa,5,2020-02-21,"Super friendly staff, if i could give it ten stars I would. Amazing food great atmosphere. There isn't a bad thing I could say about this place one of my favourite restaurants!"
Ha Gow Dim Sum House,2,2019-09-24,"We were in the neighborhood and couldn't decide what to eat so we did what others would do in our situation which was to bust out our phones and go on Yelp for suggestions! Well Yelp led us to this place based on its high ratings but I'm sad to say that Yelp has failed me again.  This restaurant's dimsum quality was not good. The curry cuttlefish was very watery and bland, their chicken feet had a weird taste, their sui mai was okay but again kind of bland, their spare ribs was full of fat and the list goes on and on with negative things to say about their other dishes. None was good!

Service was okay but their debit machine was down and I didn't have cash on me and when I asked if they take e- transfers, they said no. So I had to drive out to a bank to get cash which was a bit of a pain but of well.

Definitely will not comes back to this one."
Sugo,4,2020-03-18,"Dude - the food here is AMAZING. My boyfriend and I ordered the chicken parmesan sandwich and the rigatoni. We probably should have ordered the Sugo Platter, but didn't realize it was an option until afterwards. The rigatoni was definitely the star of the show - it was piping hot and full of flavor, with the pasta cooked perfectly.

The only reason I'm knocking a star off is because I'm a selfish American and they were taking American dollar-for-Canadian dollar to pay since we ran out of Canadian cash. It also seems like it would have been overwhelmingly busy if we had come at regular mealtimes, so try to go at a weird time like 3pm for lunch."
Nodo Restaurant,5,2020-05-31,"Pre-Covid review - 

My partner and I have been wanting to come here since we moved into the neighbourhood a year ago.  We have heard great things from several people and finally decided to come for our anniversary dinner.  

The decor is quaint, yet modern.  We were seated at our table, and our waitress came over to tell us the specials.  We wanted to try everything on the menu but settled on splitting the Arancini, the Caesar salad, one of the pastas (I can't recall now) and the tiramisu.  We devoured every bite.  We were the perfect amount of stuffed at the end of it.  The service was fabulous, and we did not feel rushed at all.  

I really like their menu.  They have a lot of traditional Italian dishes, but add their unique flavour.  I also liked the variety of pastas that they have."
Kit Kat Italian Bar & Grill,3,2019-09-27,"A decent spot for family style Italian food. The food is not very exquisite but doesn't taste too bad either. Pasta was great but other dishes were just okay. 

Beef carpaccio: very salty and oily. Part of the beef tasted frozen. There was also a sharp bitter taste in the bites. It's supposed to be made with truffle oil but I couldn't taste any truffle.  

Veal piccata: very mediocre family style dish 

Smoke duck angelhair: the pasta was very delicious! Perfectly cooked and favoured with lots of toppings. The smoke duck was delicious too."
Artisan Plus,3,2019-09-14,"Overall, an OK noodle spot. Interesting to try out but not a must-try. 

I ordered the Famous YoPo Biang Biang Mian (which the waitress mentioned was their most popular dish) and the Shuan Tofu Sheets:

Biang Biang Mian: The plate is quite large so if you're hungry this is the dish to order. The noodles were pretty tasty/chewy and the beef tasted good but the rest of the plate didn't really stand out and was loaded with vegetables (see picture).

Shuan Tofu Sheets: Again, another OK dish but wasn't amazing. While the flavor is there from the peanut and sesame sauce, the texture of the tofu was off-putting after a few strands. We didn't finish the dish. 

If you're looking for spicy noodles, give this restaurant a try. Otherwise, tons more noodle places to eat around Yonge-Dundas."
Mi Taco Taqueria,4,2020-02-06,Ordered through Ritual. Nice atmosphere. Order  ready on time. Chicken Tinga tacos had ggood flavour our. Maybe a bit on the small side but overall good value
La Marquesita,2,2019-11-04,"I ordered a taco from here, the Monterrey Steak. So tiny, it fits in the palm of your hand. Taste was ok but I don't think it is worth $6-7."
Nodo Restaurant,3,2019-05-01,"My friend recently moved to the Junction area and we decided to try this place out. Unfortunately, we didn't have a great experience. I was the first to arrive and there were quite a few empty tables on a Friday evening. The hostess said that she'd seat me when the rest of my party arrived (understandable). 5 minutes later, another customer came in (she was an older woman) and said she was waiting on 2 other people. The hostess sat her down immediately, which was a little weird to me but I didn't want to cause a scene and didn't ask about it. When the rest of my party arrived, it took them forever to seat us as it was getting busier and they were slightly understaffed. 

The food itself was good but the portions were small for the appetizers. We ordered the burrata and octopus to share. The burrata salad tasted fresh but for $20 it wasn't worth it in my opinion. Likewise, the octopus was chopped up into tiny pieces and served with potatoes. We each had about 2 tiny bites of octopus. However, the most disappointing part of the meal was the main. All four of us got the duck ragu pappardelle and I was surprised that it came with tomato sauce. The pappardelle itself tasted fresh and they were generous with the duck but too bad they were drenched in tomato sauce. I've had amazing ragu sauce at other places before and this was overwhelmingly disappointing despite it being one of their best seller. I don't think I'll be coming back here anytime soon."
Fusaro’s Kitchen,4,2019-12-03,"Encountered this cozy and casual Italian spot when hanging out with friends and we all wanted Italian. The food was delicious and the staff were friendly and tentative. It does however, get busier later on during the evening so getting a hold of a staff member will take longer than usual. However, overall a great experience, I would rate this a 4.5/5."
Fudao noodle house,3,2019-08-18,"I think I ordered the wrong broth here. I probably would have enjoyed my meal much more but the broth was overpowering, a lot more pungent than I'm used to. But I powered through it and it ended up being good. So point is, don't get the pickled vegetable with pork broth unless you know what you're getting into! I wish I could come here to try more soups. I love the concept: Piping hot soup still boiling as you dip the veggie and other condiments in. Add a few slices of pork and then the noodles as your last bet. Very presentable and affordable!"
Nodo Restaurant,3,2018-07-04,"The food over at the St. Clair location is way better as well as the service. You can check out my review there. 

Keep Eating, 
Angela"
Levetto,5,2017-02-03,"We went on a Friday evening at about 8 pm. The staff was really friendly and we just ordered a Margarita pizza (small to share). It was only $7 and was more than enough for the 2 of us. Really soft dough and crispy base - just the way I like it. The real icing on the cake was when we got a free dessert after we checked in on yelp!! Hello panacotta! Sooooo delicious. 
Anyway, we're coming back to try the pasta - that screen playing delicious videos was really tempting. Giving this place a 5/5 for being 5/5. Total bill was only 7.95 or something. Cheapest meal for 2 - score!"
Lee Chen Asian Bistro,3,2020-01-23,"Came here for team lunch for CNY. Oh man. This place is packed! When we got to the reception desk, the group in front of us did not have a reservation. They were turned away. Glad we did book the day before. 

Anyhow, Chinese food option in the financial district can be rare. And when my colleagues proposed  this place. I was thinking, let's give this a try. 

We got here and were led to our table. After we sat down, I saw the other tables were filled up in 15 mins. Talk about busy. One good thing is they got a lot of staff roaming around to deliver food. Yet, they were super busy regardless. 

We ordered our food and I went with the business lunch with meatball. The food did come out shortly after. The sauce for the meatball isn't super salty. Which I prefer. It has the right texture for the meatball. Other stuff tasted okay. It ain't bad overall, I wasn't wowed by the food."
Sichuan Garden Restaurant,3,2017-12-03,"Location: poor atmosphere, looks like the cliche Chinese restaurant right out of a movie. No eye appeal whatsoever. 

Food: ordered the chicken fried rice and the beef with ginger and spring onions. Being used to eating foods flavored with haberno peppers, we had them make our dishes spicy. The rice was very flavorful and nicely spiced. The beef dish was ok, didn't really stand alone well but mixed with the rice It was good. The water cups looked really dingy, which I didn't drink out of it Bc of that reason. 

Overall: food was good, if you don't mind the appearance of the place, I'd say go for it."
Ristorante Sotto Sotto,4,2018-04-05,"Classy high end italian restaurant. Very dimmed, the waiters need a flashlight to see the menu with the customers. It was fine for us but older individuals might not be able to see the menu. I saw an older man looking at the menu as far as he could hold haha.

The washroom is upstairs close to where the kitchen is. It's an inconvenience how far it is but the washroom is pretty. There is a vanity section for the ladies. 

Food was amazing. Spectacular. Every dish was great and is truly authentic. Their seafood done to perfection. Lovely selection of wine. Complimentary bread.

Service was accomadating but very cliche. The moment we paid, he stopped coming to us. Still half a bottle of wine left but did not stop at all to finish pouring."
Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant,3,2019-12-29,"Probably 3.5 stars. Overall, this place wasn't bad but I think it's definitely overhyped. It's known for its fresh seafood, namely king crab and lobster. Although you can choose the flavors, the most popular by far is the garlic fried option in which they fry the seafood with tons of garlic and place it on top of a mound of fries. It tasted good, but I feel like by the nature of the dish, it's hard to mess up. 

The staff also seems to be trained to upsell at every opportunity. The waitress persuaded us to order the crab/lobster combo which came with 5 lbs of lobster and 6lbs of king crab. When they came out to show us the live seafood, they claimed that they only had crabs that were 7.5 plus lbs so we would have to pay for the extra weight. 

The meal itself was good but nothing mind blowing. The soup and dessert (which was just macaroons) were very underwhelming. The crab fried rice also tasted kind of plain and didn't have much crab flavor. I did enjoy the garlic fried lobster and steamed crab legs though. 

They automatically add tax and a 10 percent service charge to the bill. They only accept cash and Canadian debit which is crazy considering how pricey the meal is - who carries that much cash around nowadays? You can pay with USD however it will be for an exchange rate slightly lower than market value. 

If you are set on trying this place, it may not hurt to come once. But considering a meal for four was almost 600$ I was expecting something much more memorable."
Donatello Restaurant,2,2018-08-23,"Recommended:
Veal marsala with penne

Ok:
Shrimp and scallops in wine sauce

Meh:
Roasted bell peppers. They're ok, but the quantity makes no sense unless you have a group to share with.

This type of food is really not my thing. A bit too straight forward and bland.

The food is simple Italian, but not special. The veal was well seasoned but a bit chewy. Still it was better than the shrimp and scallops dish, which contained small scallops and shrimp which seemed overcooked or reheated.

Olive oil and vinegar bottles are covered with corks which are very greasy. I have no idea how these could possibly be clean. Your fingers get dirty at minimum.

For the price, I expect higher quality or at least more interesting food.

Service was a bit absent at times, but passable overall. They only have one credit card machine, which created a bottleneck of a few minutes. It didn't matter this night, but if you have a time constraint, it is not a fast meal. The waiter explained and apologized, at least."
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos,1,2020-05-24,"Ok, so I know this place is all the rage. 

I ordered the grilled beef for corona takeaway and I was disgusted. There was more fat, cartilage and inedible pieces than beef. Chew chew CRUNCH - spit. Over and over. My friend called me two hours later after ordering the same thing - she ended up giving her order to the homeless after the first bite. 

This means that they either don't clean (cut the meat) properly, or using cheaper pieces to save a buck. 

The grilled chicken was dry too. Honestly though, the shrimp was good. Stick to pulled beef and chicken for authenticity and - TEXTURE. C'mon seven lives!

Very disappointed."
Magical Taste of China,1,2019-08-17,"This place is not as good as expected because of the following reasons:

1. Shredded lamb with pancakes were dry and not fresh and portions for the lamb skewers were extremely small compared to some other tables. They should have equal portion sizes for all customers. 
2. The Western Chinese lamb rice is a strange combination of what seemed like sweet potato and the rice was clumped together. It did not taste good. 
3. The membership system is ridiculous as the normal prices have a huge difference for each item listed on the menu. They should provide members to have a discount over the total bill instead. 
4. My friend had food poisoning shortly after leaving the restaurant.

For these reasons, I would be reluctant to come back as there are many places that offer much better quality and portions."
Noodle King,3,2018-08-30,"Living in Markham & Scarborough before and now close to Chinatown, I had tasted the best and cheap noodle soup. So trying Noodle King for the first time, I wasn't really impressed.

Yes, their Shrimp Wontons are massively huge and I counted 5 pcs in my soup. So I guess that makes a difference considering they give you crappy servings when you eat in food court places.

But I still paid $8.19 for my soup which to me is still not that cheap. Still the soup didn't blow my mind or something."
Eataly,3,2020-04-04,"Eating at Eataly is a mission and a half. 
Starting with the half mission, parking. Looking for public parking or street parking was a disaster. Found out after, I could have parked at the Manulife centre and received a 2 hour parking voucher if $50 was spent at Eataly, located upstairs, which was validated by reception, located on the main level. Yes, that's the process. Wild. 

That was the half mission - on to the full mission. In addition to navigating to find Eataly from the streets, you'll have to navigate to the Manulife Centre then up to the second floor. Here, you'll have to navigate through hoards of people, waiting in line or casually roaming around. Once you've done a full walk and decided where to eat, it's another 1-2 hour wait for a table at your desired restaurant. Tip. Do it the reverse way. Go to the restaurant and make your reservation THEN roam around. 

Finally, on to the food review. 
I chose La Piazza. Three items. 

Mozzarella ball. This was 4/5. It was soft and fresh as expected. Sprinkled with olive oil and salt. 

Mushroom pizza. 2/5. Basic pizza. I know. While consuming, I had a feeling I've had better at a mom and pop local pizza shop.

Penne. 3/5. Average. Nothing special to say. It was al dente - which was advertise. 

Verdict. Would I return? No. So much hype for no reason. Crowded beyond belief. 

However, if you made it this far, please try the cannoli - it made the trip worth it. They offered classic cow milk. They do offer the traditional sheep milk, it's definitely an acquired taste. These were 5/5.

I also forgot to mention. Eataly does offer fresh pasta and the freshest vegetables I have ever seen."
Mariachi’s Restaurant,4,2016-02-23,"The food there is amazing, and I'm a fan of this place now :)

The Guacamole and Corn Tortillas are the must to order!!!

Overall, the food is amazing there and I will definitely go back for another round."
Khao San Road,5,2020-01-10,"It's one of the best Thai places in Toronto and of I'm not mistaken better than Pai... *GASP* But also because they take American Express which means (all major credit cards, which to me seems like it's a dime a dozen these days)

ALSO, their portions are generous and it's worth the money you pay (they are on the more expensive side, but portion size makes up for it).

We ordered:

-Panama curry-- less curry and more of a dry curry type but freaking DELICIOUS 
-fried chicken- can't go wrong
-fried squash- the plate was twice the size of my head

And it was WAY MORE than enough for a large hungry man and my petite self."
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos,5,2019-11-23,"Special tacos are $6, which is more expensive than I am used to spending on tacos but you are also paying for unique, higher quality tacos. We had the Baja Fish and Carnitas tacos and they were delicious. Definitely a must-try place in Toronto.

Like many places in Kensington, the place is quite small and there aren't many seats. Be prepared to either stand at their standing tables or stand outside and eat. We stood at one of the standing tables which was fine because it doesn't take long to consume their delicious tacos."
GB Hand-pulled Noodles,3,2019-02-14,"This place is conveniently located a couple blocks from Dundas TTC station. It is also a block from Eaton Centre. The place is a bit crammed and a bit small, so be sure to give some waiting time if you are going at noon.

We ordered the special Lanzhou beef noodles. There are a variety of noodle options in varying thickness. The portions are sufficient for some people, but as I am a big eater, I wasn't full from the large. The noodles are good. The soup is a bit bland. And the beef isn't quite flavourful. There is not much memorable about this place, except that the prices are quite unreasonable with respect to the quality.

Overall, I would not recommend this place, but I haven't yet come across a good place for hand-pulled noodles to recommend."
La Chingada,5,2019-03-18,"Alright, I better review this place before I'm late to the party. If they keep up with the quality they provided when I visited, you can expect them to become renown in the area and even the city. When that happens, I'll proudly remind people that I first visited before their grand opening.

I had the tinga de pollo and barbacoa. I'm not sure it's necessary to break down the ingredients as many are familiar with Mexican food. They key is that the food quality and preparation are exceptional here. It's hard to avoid cliches such as ""texture"" ""fully seasoned"" ""done right"" ""full of flavour"" when describing the food here, but that's exactly how my experience was. They are clearly using great ingredients, even down to the tortillas which are better than most places. As they say ""good food makes good food"".

I would also add they everything was exceptionally fresh and the prices are fair. Can't wait to go back and hope that they can keep this up."
Chula Taberna Mexicana,4,2019-07-20,"I thought the food was good. Price was good too. Removed a star for non-disclosure of spicyness levels. But in fairness we didn't ask lol. We couldn't finish one of the tacos because it was so spicy it gave my bf heartburn. 

I would come back, but for sure consult with your server to ask about how much kick is in the food!"
Miku,4,2020-02-01,"Miku is a stylish and upscale sushi spot near the waterfront great for that special occasion. The place's self-proclaimed specialty is aburi sushi or flame grilled sushi which is indeed the highlight of the sushi menu. They offer a sampler of all the types of aburi sushi, which is 2 pieces each of the three different types of aburi sushi. If you're at all a sushi lover I would highly recommend trying them! The rolls are decent as well, although not particular too remarkable. The sashimi was fresh and presented nicely as well.

you're not a sushi lover, in which case I'd probably recommend going to a different style of Japanese restaurant, but luckily some of their entrees, in particular the sablefish is delicious. 

Overall the restaurant is a nice spot for a fancy sushi occasion in an upscale location. The service was good, and the kitchen staff was actually rather accommodating for dietary restrictions and willing to make changes. However I would say that for the price, even for upscale sushi spots in a city like Toronto, you can probably get a more unique and memorable sushi experience elsewhere, which is what keeps me from giving them one more star."
Trattoria Taverniti,5,2019-03-17,"This was such a lovely find 
Classic and authentic simple and elegant Italian food
Cozy beautiful rustic room red checkered table clothes and lovely pastas!
We had the arugula salad, shared the lasagna and then the pesto tagliatelle. Our server was from Italy. The owner is the Nona of the family. Family traditions and everything 
Going back ASAP, it was great"
GB Hand-pulled Noodles,5,2020-02-19,"I've been to GB two times now and it's one of my favorite restaurants in the world! It is a tiny restaurant but the food is absolutely delicious and is a MUST if you are visiting Toronto (I am an out of towner). 

The portion size is huge and the price is right. Honestly, you can order anything and be happy. There aren't many options but you do get to pick the size of noodle that you want. My boyfriend and I shared our dishes and they were perfect for a Toronto winter day. In the front, they even have the chef behind a clear glass so you can see him making the noodles! If you want good food and are visiting Toronto, this is the place to go. I can't wait to be back!"
El Trompo Taco Bar,5,2020-05-28,"It was fantastic, I got the signature taco and oh man it was so good. everything about it was amazing, the hot sauce on the side that they give out with your taco is really good also! I highly recommend this place!"
La Chilaca Taqueria,3,2018-08-06,"3.5 stars to some more great options of 4 stars.  Not going to lie... it's true Kensington in every sense of the neighbourhood.

If you're willing to look past the rough and gritty exterior, you may find some good tacos here.  Nothing risked is nothing gained and I feel that La Chilaca Taqueria fits that perfectly.  It's in the 'food court' of several Latin American food stalls.  Food court is an understatement... It's more like a disheveled, heavily worn and dirty open non A/C store that has every stall spilling out into a small room.  It shares the space with 3 other stalls.  

There are some tables in the back of the dingy place but there's a weird smell emanating from the back as you sit beside several broken old unused glassed counters.  On a crazy hot day, the lack of A/C makes this insane and feel like an oven.  The open back door to a few more seats barely helps.  The 'kitchen' is really a small stove top and a crammed setting of a kitchen sink and a counter to assemble.  

You're quickly greeted and told to look up at the menu.  There are daily deals like 2 chorizo tacos for $5 or 4 other tacos for $10.  Each taco is $5 each regardless of the type.  When we went, the carnitas werent ready but they had 8 other ones you could try.  Service here is efficient but I have to admit they were all busy with the World Cup... can't blame them since the entire Kensington (let's be real... Toronto) is watching.  I do have to worry a bit when we overheard the person in the kitchen saying how can they cook this chicken in under 3 minutes... ehhhh wut?  How about cooking it till it's done?

I have to admit the addition of their sauces really perked these up so grab some before taking a bite into them.  The creamy orange one has some good heat that could make you water up a bit if you're not careful.  I wasnt expecting that type of heat and wow, yeah... ice cream was needed to cool my tongue.  What I thought would be the spicy red transparent sauce was actually a tomato one that didn't have any heat and just added a little bit of flavour.  There was also a nice vibrant green sauce that was very good mix of mild jalalpeno, onions, and cilantro.  Totally refreshing to add.

Fish Taco - My favourite of the tacos.  The fish pan fried and still tender without being dried out.  This was a stuffed taco... the type where you take a bite and you realize that the sauce and pickled onions are just going to be exploding soon.  The sauce just oozes out onto your hand and you're soon licking your fingers.  The cilantro just gives a nice freshness to it... I know, not everyone likes cilantro but it's good on this one.  Another thing I love about this... they double wrap the taco so they dont fall apart easily AND they toast the corn tortilla up so they're a bit crispy.  Nice one. 4/5 

Vegetable Taco - Soooo I keep ordering Vegetable Tacos and I keep wondering why afterwards.  My search for a good one continues but I learned that tofu and cheese really doesn't work... at... all.  I feel like you do one or the other.  It's just a weird combination.  In addition to those, they had cilantro, pickled onion, and tomatoes. This one wasn't as flavourful so it really benefits from either the orange hot sauce (that will scorch you) or green fresh herb one.  3/5

Chorizo Taco - Another solid taco with the paprika giving the pork a nice flavour.  It was cooked fresh from the sausage and it didnt taste like it was standing in some pot for a few hours.  They garnished with pickled onions and cilantro and helped cut through the rich meat.  I was told this was authentic to the style in Mexico city.  4/5  

Beef Taco - Maybe I wasn't in the mood for cheese but the beef and cheese one didn't quite work.  As generous as they were with the cheese... I just felt this one was really quite heavy and a bit oily.  The beef was possibly a bit overcooked which made it a bit on the dry side.  I could have added more sauce to it but something didn't quite work as well as the chorizo.  3/5

Shrimp Taco - This was a solid one with small shrimps cooked fairly well.. they werent rubbery or dried out.  Just a nice juicy chew.  They added a spice to it that kept it out of the bland side ... though I have to admit, this wasn't as flavourful as the Chorizo.  This one does work well with a sauce to keep it from being boring.  They did garnish with the usual pickled onions and cilantro.  3.5/5

There are some really good tacos coming out of here and made freshly with some in house made sauces that really make the tacos pop.  BUT if you're the type where you're concerned about atmosphere, this might put you off.  Worse case, you can take it to go and eat it while you're walking about Kensington but just bring a few napkins, ok a lot... cause you're going to be leaving a trail of food dripping otherwise!"
La Vecchia Ristorante,3,2019-08-15,"La Vecchia is a cute restaurant with great ambiance near Yonge & Eglinton. It is filled with wooden tables and twinkle lights. 

The service is great. We didn't make a reservation for dinner but snagged a spot at the bar. Both the bartender and our server checked in with us frequently. Our water was constantly filled up and we were asked if we desired further drinks throughout the experience. 

While the food was good, it was simply average. We had the penne alla vodka (gluten free) and the capricciosa pizza. Unfortunately, only a handful of the pasta options could be made gluten free, and none of the pizza could be made gluten free. This was fairly limiting. 

There are various delicious Italian restaurants in the area and unfortunately this one simply didn't stack up (both in taste and gluten free options). I would certainly come back for drinks (I had a delicious Aperol spritz) but would likely not come back for the food."
Trattoria Nervosa,2,2019-10-20,"We came here today to have her usual Sunday family dinner. However, we found her self with a very poor service, unfriendly waiter, cold food and very plain flavors. The place is very cozy, Nevertheless I would not recommend this place."
Wilbur Mexicana,5,2019-09-03,"Since my first Wilbur visit I have ventured back my times and each better then the last!

The Fajitas in general are outstanding and at 18$ they make for good value too considering you can share easily

Ohhh and chips with Guac are a must!

........me encanta."
El Nahual Tacos,2,2019-09-10,"To be completely honest. I was expecting more.
I came in during my lunch while practically salivating on hearing the reviews. I ordered the 3 TACOS: FISH, BARBACOA? AND CARNITAS. fish taco was so bland and had no taste. The beef was pretty good. CARNITAS was decent. Service left more to be desired as the gentleman never asked if I wanted anything else but just requested I pay. Felt rushed.!"
Zhang’s Kitchen,4,2020-01-28,"Got the chance to try out Zhang's Kitchen and it was pretty good! We went early in the afternoon so we were the only ones in the restaurant; however there were a couple of people doing take out. 

The interior of the restaurant is very clean and simple and I was super impressed! The staff are friendly and attentive. I enjoyed how they served warm water infused with lemon - perfect on a cold winter day. We sat down and you order using the paper menu. We got the small braised beef brisket with noodle, the braised beef noodles (with soup) and the spicy sliced beef cold dish. You can customize your order and I added some quail eggs and bok choy and they don't skimp on the quantity!

The dishes arrived quickly and the portions were huge! There were large chunks of meat and the noodles were well cooked and flavourful. I particularly liked the spicy sliced beef. Overall, it was a very pleasant and filling meal and would swing by again if in the area."
Stelvio,3,2017-10-13,"Stelvio is an Italian restaurant in Downtown Toronto. It was packed on a Saturday night and we were lucky to have a table. After glancing the menu, we placed our order. Shortly after, our server brought us a plate of Poppyseed Sesame Bread served with EVOO balsamic vinegar dipping sauce and herb marinated olives.

Based on other Yelp review, we ordered the Taroz, which consisted of crushed potatoes with green beans, butter, onion and cheese served on a iron skillet. It was to die for. The only other thing to die for was Zuppa D'Orzo Carciofi E Patate, which was a soup with barley, artichoke, potatoes, and garlic.

We're weren't too impressed with the Dante Salad, Tagialette Al Funghi Porcini, and Tagialette Al Funghi Porcini. The Dante Salad consisted of shredded pan seared chicken breast, Caesar DOP cheese, lettuce, and red chicory lightly tossed in a dijon vinaigrette. I didn't like how either Tagialette had much flavor or sauce. Tagialette Al Funghi Porcini consisted of fresh homemade tagliatelle pasta with porcini mushrooms. Tagialette Al Ragu Bianco consisted of fresh homemade tagliatelle pasta with homemade meat sauce and fried herbs including sage and rosemary."
Good Hombres,4,2020-01-17,"After hearing many phenomenal reviews about Good Hombres, and having tried its sister restaurant Campechano, I felt very much obligated and drawn to trying this place! To my knowledge, they've recently begun taking reservations, so I placed one for a Thursday night. It's quite a long, narrow joint - upon walking in, you're met with a kitchen counter / bar for takeout and quick orders. To get to the main dining room, you pass through a small doorway. The vibe is also significantly different from Campechano; it's a far more casual vibe adorned with bright, colourful paintings.

To be honest, I was on the fence between 3 and 4 stars. On the one hand, I really did enjoy the tacos and they're objectively better than most places. On the other, I enjoyed Campechano much more, but gave that place 4 stars. In terms of cost / value, both place ended up costing me roughly the same, but I found Campechano to be far more satisfying (they have a double tortilla and have heftier, more generous fillings).

We ordered 10 tacos (for $3.95) each. I got the pescado (fish / haddock), champinones (mushrooms), camaron (shrimp) for my first round. For my second, I got a second pescado and added the barbacoa (lamb leg). My boyfriend got the carnitas (confit pork shoulder), pastor (pork butt), and barbacoa. For his second round, he got double carnitas - he just loved it that much!

Carnitas & Barbacoa
These tacos tasted identical to the ones I had at Campechano, so my review remains unchanged. The carnitas, being cooked in its own fat, is a very rich and hearty concoction. There's no real acidity, apart from the lime, to balance out the flavours - as such, it's a very pure, meaty delight. The barbacoa is seasoned and has more spices, and the meat is less 'tender and soft' compared to the pork (though objectively still very tender).

Pastor
The pork butt is definitely tougher and drier than the other meats, but still super flavourful. I particularly liked the addition of the pineapples - while it threw me off initially, I found that the fruitiness helped balance the textures and flavours. 

Pescado
There was a good chunk of fried haddock on the taco, topped with some pickles and spicy chipotle mayo. It was delicious - and so lightly battered! The flavour is a bit more muted than the meat tacos, but so satisfying. 

Champinones
This was the weakest one, I found - but still super fragrant and umami. The mushrooms didn't go as well with the tacos as the other options, but it's still very flavourful and far better than the poblano peppers I had at Campechano last time.

Camaron
I personally found this taco a bit difficult to eat; the small pieces of deep fried, brown shrimp bits often crumbled and threaten to cascade on my plate. That said, the flavours were delicious! I found them somewhat similar to the pescado (likely attributed to the common denominator of chipotle mayo), but the flavours were far richer and heartier. Definitely my favourite - and this is a slightly 'pricier' (though nonetheless not expensive) taco at $4.25. Well worth it!

Overall, I did thoroughly enjoy Good Hombres. The tacos are smaller than those at Campechano (maybe ~60% of the size?) but the flavours are the same. The service and ambiance is good. It's likely a nature of the tacos I chose (fish and shrimp), but I found there to be too much chipotle mayo. That said, I would definitely come again, and cannot wait for the opening of their third store!"
Byblos,5,2019-02-17,"Contemporary classic lounge fitting for a modern Mediterranean meal. 

Service: The memory of our server was amazing, and she offered some great suggestions for our meal. Had our order down, including the right additions and substitutions without having to write anything down. Was always topping up our water, and the servers cleared our plates/replaced them when they were dirty. Each and every dish was explained to us.

Food: The lamb ribs were fragrant with the scent of sesame and very tender, definitely a must-get. Manti dumplings were interesting, but not a fan of the yogurt sauce. Pide was also delicious, but the cheese masked most of the truffle flavour. Wagyu was cooked perfectly, and the onion and black garlic complimented it very well. Would also get the short rib kebab again and the signature dish from day one the restaurant opened, the roasted lamb shoulder. Topped everything off with a delicious burnt honey ice cream, a perfect ending to the rich experience.

Overall: Dishes were perfectly balanced and seasoned well with Mediterranean spices and flavours - perfect for sharing, although a bit pricey for the portion sizes. Modern take on traditional dishes served in a tapas format.

Tip: Ask for seating upstairs for a more intimate/classy lounge (more dimly lit), main floor seating for a more formal dining experience. Reserve early, as spots get taken up quickly!"
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,4,2019-12-28,"This place is definitely one of my favourite Thai restaurants in Toronto! The flavours are very authentic and I am still craving this now as I write this. Reservations are preferred, especially for a large group as this restaurant is extremely popular and crowded. The decor is very welcoming and unique, with vintage items on the walls and tables. I would recommend dining in the separate area in the back, as it is quite loud and may be too noisy for some. 

My favourite dishes are the pad gra prow (Basil Stir-Fry Beef with steamed jasmine rice) and the green curry that comes inside a coconut, which is a nice touch. I don't normally have a high spice tolerance, but the medium spice level was just right for me or it would be too bland otherwise. I also loved their Thai Iced Tea which was very rich and refreshing! Look forward to my next visit!"
Mexico Lindo,1,2016-06-11,"Tried to go here for our anniversary. No one acknowledged us at the door for quite a while. When the gentleman finally asked for how many and we answered three, he told us 5 min. There were several open tables, not sure why we had to wait, especially since I'm visibly disabled. 

There was one table for two available at the front, and we watched him futz with it and add a third placemat to an already crowded table. When he motioned us over (he didn't come get us, just beckoned) I had to try to explain to him that this table was not suitable as my leg wouldn't fit. He said it was for three. I asked if we could have a four top. He said none were available. I tried again to explain that I'm handicapped and wouldn't fit at this tiny table. 

Let me be clear, there were other available tables, but they were 6 tops, and he didn't want to lose the seats. I offered to wait for a four top but he said he couldn't tell me how long that would be. 

So we left. So much for hospitality. He was rude and dismissive and I won't waste the drive again. We went next door to the seafood restaurant. It was fabulous."
Banh Mi Boys,5,2020-02-20,"I can see why Banh Mi's are popular - really great food for great value.

Have had the Kalbi Beef 2x and 5 Spice Pork within the last week. So, so nice. Was my first experience of Vietnamese food in Toronto & it didn't disappoint. 5 stars."
Levetto,3,2018-11-17,"Came on a Saturday evening at 5:30 and it was empty. I had this place on my list of food to try and was looking forward to checking in and getting a free dessert. 

I was sad when they told me there wasn't any more panna cotta left which is what they would normally give as the free dessert. 

I ordered the Smoked Prosciutto pizza which wasn't bad, I enjoyed the dough as it was crispy but still fluffy inside. Looks like they make everything fresh by hand which is nice. I will try have to try the pasta next time."
Famiglia Baldassarre,5,2019-07-01,"ugh i love this place so much but why is it so far and randomly located?!

If this was located in downtown Toronto, you can bet I'll go on a pasta diet for this place. Their pasta is insanely fresh (and you can see the team in the back cranking them out) but that also means it sells out fast.

I came 10 min before opening and there was already a line. By the time the store opened, there was a solid line building up behind me. You order at the cashier and they'll ask you if you're to-go or for here. If you ask for it for here, the nice thing is they won't make your pasta until there is a table ready. You can't sit until your food is ready which is nice in a way because no one can reserve the seat while their party is miles behind in the line. Once you are seated (if you're for here), your food will be ready in another 5-10 min.

A few helpful facts:
- This place is cash only 
- They change their menus pretty consistently 
- You should 1000% buy some extra pasta to bring home even if you're not sure because by the time you finish your pasta and decide you want to bring some home, the line will be insane and maybe sold out by the time you reach the counter
- They have complementary bread which is just as good
- I don't need to recommend any dish here because they'are all A++ so order what your heart wants and I can promise you it's going to be incredible!"
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,5,2020-03-15,"I miss their Thai food there!
The curry and Tom yum soup are always two of the dishes that I always ordered! Must try if you loveeee Thai food! :)"
House of Gourmet,4,2020-02-26,"It's a bit of a no-frills place -- definitely not too fancy place by any standards. However, it's a typical Chinese resturant serving an extensive menu with hundreds of items and fairly convienient in its location and hours. It gets kinda loud inside and they only allow debit and credit card over a certain amount but that's okay. 

They have a lot of the comfort food staples, like fried rice, congee, or mapo tofu etc. I typically come here for the cold cuts like the roast duck or BBQ pork (char siu). You can get it as a dish on its own or have it over rice. 

In general, if you're looking for Chinese take-out or a simple dish over rice, this is the place to be at. They also have more expensive stuff as well, like seafood but I'm not sure how popular it is.

And oh yeah, there's Hong Kong milk tea for like two dollars, which is pretty boss."
Mexico Lindo,4,2014-06-18,"I love the food at Mexico Lindo, and although I don't live in the area I try to visit every now and again. The owner, Sandra, and her family do a great job and serve authentic Mexican food and drinks.

I always order the chicken fajitas but everything I see coming out of the kitchen looks (and smells) great. The service can be a little 'relaxed' to say the least. Free chips and guacamole while you wait for your meal.

The only thing I would change is the prices, which at around $30 per person with no drinks, is a little on the expensive side. Having said that, this is true for a lot of Mexican restaurants in the city. Overall a solid four stars."
Bar Buca,3,2020-03-09,"I really wanted to like this place. The staff were friendly, and the food LOOKED good.

Alas - not to be.

We came here because my friend was craving their crespelle (olive oil fried pancakes). That was ok - it was a bit greasier than we thought it would be (and I say this as someone who loves olive oil cake) and was lacking in taste. The bombolone sandwich was delicious - the pun was the perfect texture complement to the sausage. And the tiramisu was also super disappointing - it was their ""take"" but was definitely not an improvement.

Damn.

I'd say this is more of a 3.5/5."
Ha Gow Dim Sum House,3,2017-09-30,"Dim sum wasn't bad. I actually preferred this over the downtown China Town dim sum, but markham was better. But if don't feel like a drive thru traffic, not a bad second choice.

Ignore the decor or I think if they rearranged some stuff it would look good. 

Service was attentive but only one server who did everything so be patient. Other reviewers did mention they were out of certain items...which if they were, they should inform us and not have it on the board.

Will go back..."
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine,1,2019-11-09,"I have been here in three years and the quality has definitely come down.

We ordered the chicken fried rice which had no carrots or peas just rice and chicken. It tasted ok.

The sesame chicken was way too sweet and tasted like a chicken Tim bit.

The dim sum was below average for the price. There are definitely better and cheaper options. I a long time customer will not be returning."
Nodo Restaurant,4,2018-06-08,"Great ambiance ! 
Good staff here. 
Appetizers are a bit small. 
Menu selection was short. 
Wine selection is alright!"
7 Numbers Restaurant,2,2016-05-02,"Tasty food, but a bit of a disappointment.

I booked a big party for my brother's birthday people. They were incredible about this, they kept in communication with me and were actually able to accommodate 26 adults and 6 babies with a week's notice, which grew to 32 adults, then shrunk back to 26 once we got there. Flakiness. 

We all had the $34 prix fixe, which meant three apps and three pastas shared family style and an individual entree dish. I was sitting at a table with 11 other people, and we didn't get enough food. Each of the sharing dishes was a dinner plate size, shared across all 12 of us, leaving everyone with literally 2 soup spoons full of each item. This was a huge surprise to me as I've eaten at the Danforth location with the same sort of setup - big party, shared plates, except we had the same size of dish for 4 people. 

The other tables in our party (table of maybe 8 adults and 4 kids, and another table with 5 adults and two kids) got the same amount of food, and they were pretty stuffed. We ended up asking for a second portion of the pasta, because it really was a very small amount of food per person, especially considering the price of the meal. The server balked at this, but gave us another serving, which was devoured in a second. 

The food itself was very good (though the osso buco was a bit bland), and for the most part, the service was great, but unfortunately the dinner ended with a table of adults who were still hungry."
Wilbur Mexicana,3,2019-12-14,"Great spot if you wanna get some quick tacos or burritos.

There was a huge variety of options to order and al for a fair price however there was a huge lack of flavour in anything you ate until you added sauces from their sauce bar(which was great). I felt like I was getting grilled vegetables flavoured with salt and wrapped in a tortilla. 

My stars are really going towards the tomatillo sauce which really saved the day."
Baretto Caffe,5,2019-07-26,"This place is hands down amazing. Came with a friend this Wednesday. As other reviews have stated, it is a bit hard to find the entrance, so use the pictures others have posted for reference! The waitress who tended to us was friendly and accommodating. 

I would die for the americano served here, please get it, the coffee is amazing, smooth, and light. 

The caprese salad is amazing, specifically the spices, and the mozzarella, which I believe was freshly made. 
We piled the salad on top of the bread given to us, and please do yourself a favour and try that, as it is amazing. The freshness of all the ingredients with an extra drizzle of balsamic on top of a warm crusty bread is near godly.

My friend's pasta was also spectacular. The pasta was perfectly cooked al denté, and the sauce was just creamy enough to the point where it doesn't overwhelm you. 

Overall, amazing restaurant, both my friend and I will be returning for many more times to come."
El Charro,4,2017-09-19,"Mexican food done right! 

The meat was cooked so well, juicy and flavourful. The caramelized onions added another dimension of great flavour.  We also got guac and chips for $4.50 very good as well. 

To those who complain about waiting for food.. you are only waiting because they are making it fresh. It's not like chipotle where it sits there for what could be hours.

Good prices, good food!"
Mexico Lindo,3,2017-06-02,"I was really excited for this place because it had been such a long time since I've had Mexican food. While everything tasted great I was slightly disappointed by the mediocre serving sizes. And warning that the complimentary salsa is very spicy! Also, not that it's the restaurant's fault, but there's a huge sidewalk planter right in front of the entrance which made it pretty much impossible for our stroller to go through. A wheelchair would definitely not be able to pass so heads up. Otherwise seems like a casual and family-friendly place."
El Catrin Destileria,4,2019-12-14,"Love, love, love this place. 

There are not a lot of great Mexican restaurants in Toronto.
Look no further than this spot for a great meal.

Their ceviche and fish tacos are da bomb..
Margaritas come in a variety of flavors and as a single drink or by the pitcher.

Do not miss the churros as a finish.  They come with multiple dipping sauces and are great!

They have a great patio in the summertime. 
It gets busy too!  

It's located in the Distillery District.  Green P parking right on the site at a fee. 
This area has a lot of cobblestone walkways so leave the high heels at home."
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine,1,2019-02-21,"Came here to celebrate my Friends Birthday, Food is good but for the price its not worth it.service not good. I ask them if they can do something for her like candle and small dessert..And she said yeah we can do that..And I was waiting for it and she forgot and I felt bad that I have to said it infront of my friend when it supposed to be surprise.He said that they don't have anything like that but We saw that they did it on the other table.By the way we paid around $500 for that small portion of food and Bad service!"
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,4,2020-02-16,"Hip young Thai restaurant that meets or surpasses  the old school authentic Thai restaurant taste! Cool decor and atmosphere, played good music. Young waiters and waitresses. 

Accommodated us by seating us at the bar! They also had the option of traditional Thai floor seating. 

We were in a rush and opted to sit at the bar. The food was unreal!!!!!!!! 

We had a papaya salad for starters which we were hoping was spicy but literally had no spice factor at all. It was ehh...I have had better.

But the main dishes were top notch.

I ordered the Pad Gra Prow with chicken and I can not stop thinking about it. So delicious. The pad thai was also yummy. But the Pad Gra Prow was my absolute fav."
Mi Taco Taqueria,3,2019-05-03,"Hidden away on Queen West is this blink and you'll miss it taco joint. The interior is roughly the size of a shoebox, decorated festively, with a fake slanted roof. The roof makes it feel unnecessarily cramped. 

This place was rather disappointing. I brought my friends here because I enjoyed it a lot the first time around, but this visit was nowhere as good. The service here was wonderfully efficient, but the food was disappointing. I ordered the 3 taco plate (2 carnitas, 1 chicken tinga), chips and salsa verde, and a margarita. My total bill was around $22, which was not bad. The margarita was the best part of my order. 

Unlike other places, the margarita was strong. I got a good buzz from just one glass of margarita. It wasn't too sweet or tart or artificial-tasting, but rather perfectly balanced. The same cannot be said for the similarly green salsa verde. With saltier chips, the salsa might have tasted better, but with the very plain tortilla chips, the salsa tasted underseasoned and very vinegary - badly in need of salt. 

The tacos were similar in taste - while the freshness of the ingredients inside can be tasted, there wasn't enough of it, and it was hard to tell the difference between the chicken and the pork. A bit more seasoning could have helped. Lastly, the corn tortillas were absolutely dreadful. I had several mouthfuls of dry tortilla without filling to give it flavor and much-needed moisture, and it was like eating paper. I think the tortillas were kept under heat lamps for just a bit too long.

In summary, I'd come for the margaritas, but would not consider it this the best tacos in town."
Tacos El Asador,1,2020-02-14,"It is Valentine's Day, I was so happy my boyfriend came from the Netherlands to visit and we had the best day exploring the city, afterwards we were too tired to go out so opted to order in some good Mexican food! 

We consider ourselves taco connoisseurs, and often indulge in a tasty tactac. We were VERY excited to have so many taco options so we ordered 3 soft shells and 3 crispy shells (as other Mexican enthusiasts may know, is not as common as people may think to have both shells) 

To provide more context you didn't ask for ... this was the first MUCH anticipated spot on our taco tour of Toronto. 

We have a methodical and detailed evaluation system in place for reviewing and ranking our tacsperiences - the system ranks the following on a scale of 1-5 (5 being the best) ; 

flavour and freshness (1)
Moisture (0)
Mouth feel (1)
Crunch (0)
Contents to Shell ratio (0)
Cheese Quality (0 - cheese unaccounted for, still looking for it)
Smell (2)
Overall (4/35) 

This may seem bitter, however, we are AS unbiased as they come. 
Furthermore, we are highly liberal individuals. Our disappointment is immeasurable yet our day is not ruined, because we still have each other, and our view is lovely (will include pic) 

We hope this is a one off, and the in person experience is better than delivery."
Buca Yorkville,3,2020-02-16,"The entrance was a bit hard to find, since there was no door / entrance off of the main street (where the restaurant's address was). You need to go into the Four Seasons Hotel area, turn left, and it's the last door by the fence (it's right across from the side entrance of Four Seasons Hotel). There's no obvious sign indicating where the restaurant is, until you actually get to in front of the door.

The food tastes good, but nothing too special. Portion sizes of the pasta are a bit on the small side. The vegetable sides are quite good and rightly portioned. Service is attentive and just like in any other higher-class restaurants."
Los Guaca-Moles,1,2018-09-23,"If you want to pay for a virgin margarita for a regular priced margarita, by all means come to this place!"
Campechano Taquería,3,2018-08-04,"Delicious tacos, horrible sangria. 

Campechano and Seven Lions are the only two ""authentic"" tacos I've had in Toronto, as compared to tacos you can get in the US, particularly as you get close to the Mexican border. At $6-$8 each, they're not cheap, and you'll need between 2-4 to fill you up. 

Avoid the sangria - one of the worst I've had in Toronto."
La Carnita,4,2019-09-16,A very warm and welcoming atmosphere especially if you can get the tables tucked away in the back. Food is great and everyone enjoyed what they ordered. The portions are small so if you enjoy eating make sure to order a good amount.
Eataly,2,2020-01-14,"We ate at the Le Pizza La Pasta restaurant. 

I would have given this place 4/5 if it weren't for what happened with our billing/menu.

We came in on a Tuesday night. Put our name in and had a walk around for 40-45 minutes. Overall the food was good. We ordered a pasta and a pizza along with the Burutta as an appetizer. The bread came with some really tasty olive oil. The pizza was excellent with generous toppings. I found our pasta good but not great. 

WHAT WENT WRONG: The menu had the Burutta for $8. When the receipt came - I did a quick glance and paid the bill. However the total came up higher than I thought it would be I went back to look at the receipt. The Burutta showed up as $18. I did a double take on a new menu from the front desk to make sure it said $8. My server was elsewhere by now. I went to the front to ask the hostess who at this point basically dismissed me with a chuckle that the menu was ""printed wrong"". I was in a rush so left but I would have definitely taken this up with the manager.

I really think they should have just fixed their menu (even just pencilled it in), or warned me it was a pricing error when I ordered."
Giulietta,5,2019-04-18,"Oh my god. This place was amazing in every aspect. I came here on a Wednesday night with my coworker and we were aware of the positive reviews but this totally exceeded my expectations. It was pretty busy and we didn't have a reservation so we were seated at the bar. I didn't mind, and the service at the bar was actually phenomenal. Very attentive and friendly. They took time to wipe our table between courses and ensured our drinks were never empty.

We shared the polpo e fagiolli (grilled octopus, cannellini beans and salsa verde) and cavolgiore in paedella (cauliflower, sultana raisins, garlic, lemon and parsley) to start. The latter dish is actually a side but we had it as an appetizer. The octopus, which came highly recommended by the staff was cooked to perfection. It has a nice amount of char to it and was very crispy. The cauliflower was good too - an interesting combination with the raisins but it worked!

For the main, I got the reginelle pappardelle (slow cooked oxtail ragu, pangratto, parsley and parmigiano reggiano). It was soo tasty. There was a good amount of oxtail, and the flavours were all there. There was a crispy layer of breadcrumbs and cheese and it added a bit of texture to every bite. Loved this dish so much.

For dessert we shared the lemon crostata (lemon meringue with candied rosemary) and bonet piemontese (italian custard with amaretto, coffee and vanilla). Nothing but good things to say about both of these dishes!"
Homemade Ramen,3,2019-01-06,"Fresh ramen noodles are not the healthiest food you can eat, but do taste so good.  I picked a dish with braised beef.  The noodles were extremely enjoyable. The braised beef was not tender.  Next time I will pick another meat with extra noodles!

Service was prompt & efficient. Decor is very basic."
Banh Mi Boys,3,2020-02-20,"Not authentic!! It's a good sandwich with good fillings. The bread however, is what makes a Banh mi a Banh mi and it was too soggy. Really good Banh mi bread is just perfect crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. This is not it. The fries were okay as well. Also too soggy. Sigh."
Harmoney Chinese Restaurant,2,2017-04-26,"This is yet another restaurant in Chinatown which specializes in homemade dumplings and Northern Chinese cuisine. 

I came here only because Yummy Dumplings was closed for lunch on Wednesday, so I ended up here to satisfy my dumpling cravings. 

I ordered the pork & chives dumplings (boiled) which was so so. The skin was thicker than I'm used to but still acceptable & you get 16 dumplings for $7.99. The XLB soup dumplings came next. It was presented in the usual bamboo steamer and you get 10 small bite size pieces. It certainly wasn't my favourite because the skin was thick & some seemed under cooked. The pork filling was okay but the soup content wasn't very consistent. Some were not replete with soup when biting into them and overall wasn't very satisfying. Also it's typically served with some fresh ginger on the side to make your dipping sauce but they don't here. Maybe their Xian style dishes are what they are best known for but it certainly wasn't the dumplings."
Ha Gow Dim Sum House,1,2018-01-14,"Worst Chinese food ever. It's places like this that give Chinese food a bad name. Threw out 75% of our order. 

Ordered what I thought would be staple Cantonese dishes that any decent place would find hard to screw up. Well guess what, Ha Gow managed to do just that. The seafood fried noodles were capital B bland - would it have hurt them to put even one drop of soy sauce? They also used cheap shrimp and squid that had no flavour. We also ordered the fried shrimp with spicy salt. This is honestly the most basic Cantonese dish (equivalent to fries for a Canadian restaurant). Well what came were those cheap shrimps they used for the noodles but smothered in a thick batter (they looked like balls of grease). Each bite oozed with grease and didn't taste like shrimp at all.

The other dishes ordered were equally bad. Seafood dumpling (all it tasted of was MSG), steamed squid in ginger and onion (think rubber bands laced with MSG), and shrimp rolls (no flavour). The spinach & shrimp dumpling was the only thing decent item. 

Avoid, avoid, avoid."
Fudao noodle house,5,2018-11-21,"I am a soup fanatic. I have soup summer winter fall, no matter the season. 

This noodle place fulfills all my criteria: clean, CHEAP, beautiful gorgeous food (I love it when they set down the huge stone pot of soup in front of you), wonderful selection of soup base (I go for the original in the summer, and spicy during winter), they even give you SHRIMP as one of the side dishes, PHEW! LUX! 

Free noodle refill 
Awesome service 
Discount when you pay with cash 
Close to campus 
(Almost) no wait time.

I'm just waiting for them to get $$$ so they can expand to a bigger venue (and possibly franchise it so I can have my soup closer to home..)"
Ramen Isshin,5,2020-03-11,"This is my favourite Ramen place!
As aways they didn't disappoint me. I had the Stone Bowl Shoyu Kotteri Tsukemen and my friend had the Garlic Shoyu Ramen and to finish off I got the Mochi for the first time as a dessert. Stone Bowl Shoyu Kotteri Tsukemen was unique! Its cold noodle and you dip the cold noodle into the hot pot! Highly recommend it!"
Ristorante Sotto Sotto,2,2019-12-29,"Came here on a Sunday evening with 4 people. The seafood risotto was good with lots of seafood. 

The surprising part was that the server/restaurant added automatically added a 20% tip to the bill. He just put in the tip amount himself on the POS terminal and said service charge was added. 

I do not like being forced into tipping at a certain amount and therefore would not visit the restaurant again."
El Charro,2,2019-05-26,"Located just across the street from the Broadview TTC station the place is hard to miss. A no frill joint with simple Mexican decor. Based on the reviews ordered the 3 for10$ tacos : Asada, steak and chorizo... I had a lot of hope , but crash landed my expectations with dry and not so fresh tacos. Honestly not at all up to the mark. Wife ordered a tostada with tinga de pollo ( chicken) and was equally disappointed with the serving size and taste. We definitely need to go back to Seven Lives to reset our experience."
La Vecchia Ristorante,5,2019-12-07,We had a group dinner in their private grotto.  The dinner and service was excellent.  Great cocktails.  The grotto was beautiful.  Would highly recommend for dinner or private event.
Los Guaca-Moles,3,2019-07-07,"The service was great and the ambiance was nice too. I most definitely will come back for drinks.

However, the food was too pricey and the portions too small - it wasn't worth it.
My boyfriend got the Alambre vegetariano for $18, which consisted of 3 tiny tacos filled with a bit of veggies and a small rice tower next to it. For that price he was expecting a nice and filling meal, not a sad appetizer sized meal."
KINKA IZAKAYA ORIGINAL,5,2020-05-14,"I would share this, but I'm too shellfish 
.
CHEEEESY baked oysters with spinach, mushrooms, and garlic mayo   
5/5
Incredibly delicious  I can rarely order this dish from Kinka Izakaya because THEY ALWAYS RUN OUT! Located at the heart of Toronto, this authentic Japanese restaurant is super fun, loud, and welcoming! It's the perfect spot to let loose and chill with friends! oishiiiii~

Take advantage of the 30% off promo they have on all takeout orders and order now!"
Chula Taberna Mexicana,5,2019-07-31,"Food was amazing. Things that stood out and a definite must try were the: ""Mexican street corn, the cactus dip (best item on menu imo), the zucchini fritters and the chicken enchilada. The patio is super cute and great for just chilling with friends and having some yummy cocktails. Loved the vast tequila selection as well!"
El Charro,3,2018-09-30,"We ordered takeout from here over the weekend and the food was okay. I would consider it mediocre but for the low price of $3-4 per taco you can't really complain. 

Pros:
Low price
Gluten free options (corn tortillas)

Cons:
Not as flavourful as other tacos I have had. 

In all honestly I thought the value was really good but the flavour could be improved.

I ordered the beef and cactus/mushroom taco. They didn't blow me away but they were pretty good for the low price point. 

Would I return?
If I was in the area and needed a gluten and lactose free meal... sure!"
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos,3,2020-04-20,"This place is a small hole in the wall and worth visiting if you crave some good old fashioned tacos rather than the commercial stuff.. portion sizes were good however the flavours were slightly missing for me.. 

I would visit them again if I was in the area, but not necessarily my go to place. Please don't let my review deter you from trying their tacos though, they are still pretty good. 

Flavours can be very subjective and this place is definitely worth a try.. but if you know and love tacos and taco culture as much as me, then you would also know that everyone has their own go to spot.. 

This place has great service, friendly staff and a small seating area if you just want to eat quickly or grab'n'go."
Trattoria Nervosa,2,2020-05-15,"My boyfriend and I used to go to Trattoria Nervosa all the time, it closed down a couple of times for ""renovations"" so we havent been in a while. We just ordered from them after they opened up post-COVID era and were supremely disappointed with the food. The prices stayed the same but the portions were significantly smaller and the crust for the pizza wasnt as good as it used to be. You used to be able to smell truffles when you walked in the restaurant, I couldnt even taste them at all on the pizza. They also got rid of the beef carpaccio and the risotto nervosa which were a couple of our favourite dishes! :("
La Carnita,3,2019-09-22,"I'll start off by saying that I firmly believe that people come here for the atmosphere. It's a great place to just hang out, enjoy the music, and the drinks ! The taco's aren't the best I've ever had...nor are they the worst tacos either. You're paying almost $6 for ONE little TINY sample sized taco. So you don't get your money's worth at all.  They have quite a bit of options to choose from when it comes to tacos which is actually a pro to this place( except for when some options are sold out..). A huge con to me would be the fact that some of my tacos were cold by the time it got to me.. another huge con would be the service. Considering that there were literally 4 customers seated you would have expected them to be a lot more attentive, but that wasn't the case. Anyways the chances of me returning to eat are extremely low. Might just stop in to have a drink if I'm ever in the area though...HOWEVER if you do decide to give this place a try..  go for the shrimp taco ! 

$60 dollars later... stomach was still growling and I had to head over to McDonalds. ..."
Juicy Dumpling,5,2019-12-03,"Food: 5
Price: $
Interior: 4


We had lunch at another fancier restaurant in the area - Asian Legend and ordered the crab pork dumplings, that is incomparable to crab pork dumplings served in Juicy Dumpling - the fast food place here.

The crab and pork dumplings here are soooo delicious, and at very affordable price point.

We ordered a regular pork dumpling ($3) and a crab+pork dumpling ($6), both are very juicy, and extremely delicious.. comparable to the ones we had in China, or New York's Spring Deer Restaurant.

Wished I had more room in my tummy to get more of it.

This place deserves a Michellin recommendation."
Homemade Ramen,3,2018-10-02,"Pros: quick service, nice staff, great (fresh) ramen noodles 
Cons: dirty table, staff overworked, hard to get a table after lunch still, difficulty finding the best vegetarian/chicken options, some waiters can't communicate in English that well though are super nice and try hard 

Summary: I ordered chicken despite wanting vegetarian but am new to eating more veggie options so I tried to just get the Chicken stir fry. It was all chicken, too much salt and barely any veggies. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again but I'd be open to getting a ramen dish. My mom got beef so I couldn't really try it, I only tried the noodles. She loved her beef ramen so maybe that helps someone out there"
Carisma,1,2019-07-04,"Disappointed. 
Good service but not so good food. The pasta was so tough to the point of being uncooked!  the bread was good."
7 Numbers Restaurant,3,2019-09-15,This spot is not bad. The room is ok but nothing exceptional nor disappointing. The food is decent but again neither exceptional nor disappointing. Meatballs were excellent but lasagna was served almost mashed in a bowl and just ok. The wine list is mediocre. Service was nice and friendly. P
Mi Taco Taqueria,3,2019-08-30,"This place is a very busy spot downtown and it's the type of place you come and go or take it to go because of how tight the space is. I got the 3 type plate and they're okay. They're not bad but not amazing either (bear in mind, I eat a lot of tacos). Definitely worth trying out if you're already in the area but would I take an hr TTC ride to come here again? Nope."
House of Gourmet,3,2019-07-22,"(SKIPTHEDISHES Delivery Review)

My friend and I decided to order delivery on a Saturday morning. 
They have a HUGE menu and it was actually a little confusing for indecisive me to find something I could decide on.

We ended up getting:
1. Pork & Preserved Egg Congee: My friend really enjoyed this
2. Minced Beef Congee: The congee came to my apartment HOT (yay) and it was really well made in my opinion. There was a good amount of beef and I liked the amount of ginger in there to give it extra flavor (and it makes me feel 'healthier'
3. Dough Sticks: These were still warm when it arrived. Fairly standard but still a positive that it made it to the apartment without being soggy
4. Rice rolls with Shrimp & Soy Sauce: Never ordering these again. The shrimp didn't seem like it was fresh. The rice rolls were really chewy and plasticky instead of being soft and silky. For $7 the portions were TINY. 

For those 4 very basic things it came to about $27 (not including delivery charge).

I used to come here when I was really little with my grandma as her temple is right next door. I'd come back just to see how it compares in person."
Ramen Isshin,3,2020-02-16,"I was so excited to come here based on the number of reviews that said this was ""the best ramen in Toronto"". 

I was underwhelmed. The spicy red miso ramen had zero flavor and zero spice. 

Service was great and friendly. I joined the waitlist on Yelp while we were ubering from Union. By the time we got there we waited less than five minutes. 

You just put yourself on the waitlist and once you get there you check in with the host. They text you once your table is ready. Very efficient. 

But yeah. It was ok. I've had better ramen..."
Taverna Mercatto,3,2019-11-20,"I landed in Toronto on the day it was snowing a lot. It was the beginning of the snow season. After checking into Airbnb, I was looking at nearby places to have a good meal. I tried to visit this place. The ambience is pretty nice and the staff was very friendly and welcoming. I went onto try their spaghetti. I didn't like it much as I felt it wasn't properly cooked plus it didn't have much flavor. I finished my meal with Caramel Coppetta dessert (Cookie Crunch Gelato with Roasted Peanuts) and Tiramisu. Tiramisu was again a let down but I loved the Caramel Coppetta. So, overall I would say the experience was pretty average."
Blu Ristorante,5,2018-12-08,"Got the ahi tuna dish. Really tasty and fresh. The service was amazing too. Had a bottle of wine with friends and it was really good too.

Dark lighting, fine dining... posh place

Bread and dessert were really good too!"
Banh Mi Boys,4,2019-10-03,"Solid. I always get the grilled pork banh mi, and am always happy with my choice.

There are 3 levels of heat to choose from - sriracha, jalapeño, habañero. Having gone the jalapeño route a few times and finding there wasn't enough heat, I got the habañero and found there was way too much. You never know what a batch of peppers is going to be like on a given day, which keeps things exciting. Now I go for ""extra"" jalapeño... which is often just the perfect amount of too much.

If it's sunny out, my banh mi boy and me like to order in, but take our order out to a nearby park to eat. The meat is warm, the sandwich well constructed and well wrapped (a cute little elastic band holds it all together)... and the fresh, grilled bun makes it all come together. Orders come up pretty fast here, and the price cannot be beat. I wish there was a location in Queen West."
La Carnita,5,2020-01-05,"I would say La Carnita has one of the best tacos around this area ! There are many selections of tacos and two of my favourite ones are the carne asada and the spicy chorizo. The lunch special have never failed to delight me! The deal is $16.99 + tax for two tacos, one appetizer and one dessert which ends up to be a very good deal ! I would say my favourite appetizer to get is the Mexican corn as it has this creamy cheese coated on top of a roasted sweet corn. Definitely a hot spot to come and try!"
Kit Kat Italian Bar & Grill,1,2019-08-19,I can't tell you anything about the food as we left after 15 minutes and the waitress not even close to coming to our table.  9:00 at night not the time for the waitress to be telling jokes.
Buca Yorkville,3,2019-11-03,"The food was good. But nothing amazing. We ordered the branzino it was good showed us the fished carved it table side. Great presentation.  Unfortunately it tasted like it was drowned in oil and lacked other flavours. We also ordered cured fish. Most of them tasted good some of them just tasted fishy.

The service wasn't bad. Over it was good had to try pretty hard to get our server a few times.  

Also they have a fruit fly problem inside.  Nov 2019. Half way through our meal we went from having one fly to 10. It wasn't pleasant.  The server were kind enough to move us to a different table and comp us 2 glasses of wine. But still wasn't what I would expect in this type of establishment."
Enoteca Sociale,3,2019-05-09,"Enoteca is a nice spot with great drinks and great vibe to grab a bite and hang out with friends. I've driven by Enoteca a number of times and finally had the time to go check this place out. Located just west of Dundas and Dovercourt, you can't miss the massive doors. 

Service was great from start to finish, attentive and overall a good experience. However, the food was decent at best. The Cacio e Pepe was on the saltier side, so be ready for that. It was very rich in flavour, a pinch less of salt and this would be been wonderful. The charcuterie board was decent, although I must say that the cheese was really good. 

Best dish of the night goes to the arancini balls. Really nice and crispy on the outside, stringy and warm cheese on the inside. Drench it in the tomato sauce, you won't regret it."
Enoteca Sociale,5,2020-03-08,"We returned after a few years.  Our experience was exceptional and better than we remember from last time. No reservations were required, We got a seat at the bar.  Food and service was brilliant."
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine,1,2018-11-13,It was way over priced for the type of food you get. One particular waiter was very rude (Tony). The other waiters were polite but the ratio of wait staff to patrons was not balanced. We had trouble just getting water or trying to get our bill.
Banh Mi Boys,4,2020-02-11,"Can't belive I haven't rated the original Banh Mi Boys.. its so good! Lots of fresh fun things like Banh Mis, Kimchi Fries and Baos. Last time I was here we had to order everything. So much food! 

Real taste of Toronto/ LA"
Comal y Canela,3,2019-03-10,"Don't expect a Chipotle/Taco Bell type place!

Parking:  There is drive-thru parking for this plaza, but lot was full of deep potholes.  It's best to park on Macdonald Ave.  It's a small residential street, just north of Lawrence.

Restaurant itself is SMALL.  There are 4 tables and a counter with a few stools.  Restaurant opens early for Desayunos.

I believe this restaurant specialises in Michoacan food, the birthplace of canitas, low and slow cooked meats, and stews such as pozole.  Prices for specialty items were on the ""higher end"", e.g. pozole was $15 and a Michoacano Burrito (snout-to-tail, slow cooked pork), $15.  There wasn't much sauce in the burrito itself, no rice, just meat.  It was nicely cooked, but quite porkie.

Overall, the tastes are quite different than, let's say, your typical taco places downtown.  It's more about regional cooking.

Area seems a bit rough, so some of the prices did surprise me.  Ok to try, but I wouldn't drive out of my way (esp at night) to head there!"
La Chingada,5,2020-02-12,"Best staff and best tacos!!!!  Mikaela and Myles were just EXCELLENT and ensured that I (a person who tastes soap in cilantro) was well taken care of.  Come here on a Wednesday night, like we did, and you will get the most out of the excellent customer service. 
A+++!"
Ha Gow Dim Sum House,3,2019-09-22,"Spinich garlic shrimp was great. Beef shu mai was a little salty. Sour and sweet pork was too dry and hard to chew, so they replaced it with sour and sweet chicken.  It is cash only!"
Playa Cabana,3,2019-08-24,"Surprisingly good Flautas! They came as 3 rolls made of a crunchy tortilla containing lots of shredded juicy beef (although I thought it tasted more like pork haha). It all sat in a pool of thick savoury sauce that wasn't overly salty. I also tried their White Wine Sangria, $60 for a pitcher was OK for this citrusy drink with a decent amount of alcohol! 

TIP: if you're celebrating a birthday, let the staff know and they'll surprise the bday person with a hat, song & free slice of a DELICIOUS dulce Leche soaked cake !

Otherwise, the indoor seating space is really tight and the service was subpar."
98 Aroma,4,2019-08-27,"Great little upscale spot.
We ordered the shrimp pan friend dumplings which were bright and flavorful.  We also ordered the Kung Pao Chicken which was freaking fantastic!  It was more than enough food for two people.

Service was decent, prices were fair.  Standard beer selection."
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos,4,2019-09-22,"Pros:
1. The shrimp & cheese taco (only 1 taco...) is delicious.
2. The taco finishes with a layer of cheese and pickled onion, quite guilty :) 
3. And a layer of meat at the bottom!

Cons:
1.long lineup 
2. $2 higher than other places in Kensington Market."
MEXITACO,2,2019-03-02,"Ordered take out on a Saturday evening; Chicken Wings ($12.99), Burrito De Carne Asada ($12.99), and the Quesadillas De Tinga ($8.99). Staff were not overly friendly, ignoring me upon entry, servicing a walk-in couple before me, and assuming I was a food delivery courier.... The portions were all small, especially the SIX wings, yes only 6, which tasted OK. The burrito was one of the worst I've had in the city, lacking any flavour, and the Quesadillas was average. The sour cream that came with the Quesadillas was also questionable as it tasted, and had the consistency of being watered down. At a $25 price point this meal might have garnered 3 stars.

I will never return.

Aside: I noticed they charge $8.50 for pints which I thought was pricey. For reference The Keg charges the same price their craft beer selection."
Buca Yorkville,3,2019-07-21,"What's happening Buca? Is expansion over quality influencing the dishes.

Was staying in the area for an occasion and decided to head here for desert here after dinner at The One at Hazelton Hotel. We ordered 3 desert dishes, including their tiramisu. Can't say I was impressed. 

Service as usual was great. 

Repeat:Likely no."
Tacos El Asador,3,2018-10-22,"Who doesn't love a good taco?

I surely do, so I was happy to meet my dining companion at Tacos El Asador, as authentic-sounding a taco joint as I've ever encountered in our fair city.

I decided to go with the Chorizo and the Birria (Goat) tacos, with the latter arriving first. I don't think I've ever eaten goat meat in the context, so I was definitely excited to give this one a try. It didn't disappoint. The meat was cooked perfectly and contained a very flavorful blend of spices, while the two sauces on the table, of which one is impressively hot, effectively enhance the taste of the concoction.

The Chorizo arrived next and while it too was quite good, it didn't blow me away like the first one. It tasted like virtually every other chorizo taco I've ever eaten; there weren't any unexpected flavors at work here, and in fact, the chorizo itself was a little bit on the bland side. I still enjoyed the heck out of it, though, especially when I added those aforementioned sauces.

I also ordered a bowl of their Chicken, Black Beans and Tortilla Soup. I'm no tortilla soup expert, so it's entirely possible this was an above-average variation, but I wasn't impressed. The broth was salty without being flavorful, while the plentiful bits of tortilla got soggy immediately and gave the dish a rather unpleasant texture. I should note, too, that the soup comes with a fairly hefty amount of cheese, which definitely should have been indicated on the menu."
Giulietta,4,2019-06-12,"Good date place. The atmosphere was phenomenal. The food good but for what you pay I think you can get something  more? The seafood pasta had salty clams, I think the clams they were using was naturally salty? But a little bit too salty to eat. 
Olive stuffed sausage was amazing. The tripe roman style was good but wish it was more flavourful. All in all great place. Service and cocktails were good as wel"
Asian Legend,1,2018-06-02,"Food was ok nothing special. 
The taste was more blend i don't know i thought after reading the reviews it will be a good place but I didn't like the food flavors. 
We ordered a lot of food.
After waiting so long that someone's gonna pick up our order.
To this counts noodle with beef, crispy fried noodles, veggies and dumplings and beef pancake.
Actually I liked the beef pancake and the dumplings.
When we were finished we ordered the bill. 
A lady came with the takeout boxes and then the drama starts I don't know the lady was packing the food and she throws angry the empty plate on the table. 
She got so upset first I thought I gave here to less tip and then I was like no it can't be. 
So she was so angry she went to the other waiters and keep on pointing to our table and she was like angry like no tomorrow. 
I was literally shocked what happen to her.  
Trying to ask but well she didn't speak English.
So I ignored them all of them. 
I don't know maybe she got mad that I couldn't finish my food.
So my advice for this place is nothing special. If you want some waiter getting angry at you for no reason sure go ahead. This place is not recommended from my side."
Greedy Duck & Noodles,2,2019-04-29,"Maybe I didn't know what to expect but the wings are served cool and are mostly skin and bone. Did not do it for me. The noodles were hot and flavorful but the sesame texture is quite chalky and I didn't find myself wanting to eat more than a few big bites full. Mostly just noodles, a little sauce and some garnish."
Zhang’s Kitchen,3,2020-02-29,Decent noodles with lots of meat.  I definitely enjoyed the noodles so I'd say it's worth a try.
Mexico Lindo,3,2018-07-20,"I'm all for small, authentic , family run business , and this is exactly what you get at Mexico Lindo. 
My friend and I visited on a Wednesday afternoon & we were one of two tables. I ordered the guacamole, & fish tacos (on special on Wednesday's) & my friend ordered the beef chimichanga. 
The guacamole was amazing- lasted us 3-4 refills of chips. It was fresh, smooth & the perfect consistency. I just wish it came with better salsa (tasted like the basic Tostitos one out of the jar). 
The fish tacos- were okay at most. Not much flavour in the tacos (I've had better at JOEYS & other chain restos). Their rice however was fresh & delicious and their salad tasted like a Greek salad but was still very good. Also- there was nothing spicy or flavourful about the dish which is why I was  disappointed. 
The chimichangas- my friend ordered beef but got chicken. Not the biggest deal to us but still odd how the waitress forgot when we were one of two tables. She liked her dish and it was so filling! 

Overall, my friend and I both left with take out boxes because of how filling everything was. Majority - if not all- plates come with beans, rice & salad. Service and food were mediocre at best (the birchmount express location is much better) but I will come back here to support the family's business."
House of Gourmet,1,2019-11-23,"Terrible service. Despite seeing my party, they continued to ignore us until we stopped them while they were walking by us. Food was cold and did not taste good at all. Highly do not recommend."
GB Hand-pulled Noodles,5,2019-11-02,"Got there on a Friday around 12:30 so I waited about 15 minutes for a table for 2. Hubby and I split a mega special Lanzhou beef noodle with the picked daikon radish side and jellyfish side.

Broth is perfectly seasoned (I asked for them to make it spicy and to add green onions and coriander/cilantro). Broth may seem bland to a lot of non-Asians but it was just right because of eating it with aforementioned side dishes. 

The noodle makers scared the $hit out of me when I was waiting in line because they didn't start pounding the noodles until about 10 minutes in. 

Paying bill is easy, multiple card readers on hand."
GB Hand-pulled Noodles,3,2019-12-15,"I have to give credit where credit is due - GB Noodles is the restaurant that made me a noodle-soup fan. I lived in China from 2015-2017, and while I was there, I didn't find a noodle soup I enjoyed. 

GB Noodles changed all of that. I used to love coming here. It was consistently delicious.

I'm not sure what's changed, but it definitely isn't the soup I remember. It's still good, don't get me wrong, but after coming back for the first time in about a year, I'm just not sure what's changed. The broth is decent, the noodles are still fantastic, but the overall effect left me a bit wanting."
Levetto,2,2017-11-28,"I really wanted to like this place. I've had it bookmarked for ages as I love Italian food but I don't go downtown often so I saved it for a day when I was in the area. 
Anyways that day finally came and I went for my favourite Margarita pizza. But the excitement fizzled as soon as I saw my food. It looked sad. The crust looked crispy but when I bite into it, it was doughy and almost underdone. There was very little ingredients on the pizza and dough to ingredient ration was seriously off. I'm thinking I probably just went at the wrong time on the wrong day but still.... I've literally been waiting over a year to try this place with rad reviews. Honestly disappointed. I didn't even finish it."
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos,1,2020-05-24,"Ok, so I know this place is all the rage. 

I ordered the grilled beef for corona takeaway and I was disgusted. There was more fat, cartilage and inedible pieces than beef. Chew chew CRUNCH - spit. Over and over. My friend called me two hours later after ordering the same thing - she ended up giving her order to the homeless after the first bite. 

This means that they either don't clean (cut the meat) properly, or using cheaper pieces to save a buck. 

The grilled chicken was dry too. Honestly though, the shrimp was good. Stick to pulled beef and chicken for authenticity and - TEXTURE. C'mon seven lives!

Very disappointed."
Hong Kong Bistro Cafe,3,2018-01-04,"Hong Kong Bistro Cafe is a HK cafe (cha chaan teng) located in downtown Chinatown. Living in Scarborough, there are tons of HK cafe options in Upper Scarborough and Markham but surprisingly not many downtown that I'm aware of.

HK cafes (cha chaan tengs) serve low cost Canto-Western cuisine and this is a result of Britain's colonization of Hong Kong and as a result it ended up impacting the food served.

I have been to a Hong Kong Bistro Cafe a few times and dropped by recently on a late Friday afternoon during the holiday season. I ordered the lunch special which was a baked grouper in a tomato sauce over a bed of spaghetti, it also came with a soup (choice of Chinese soup, cream soup and Russian Borscht which is essentially a tomato soup) and a HK milk tea for $8.50 plus tax. The spaghetti was pretty basic but the baked grouper was cooked perfectly, really well done. The Russian borscht (tomato soup) soup was basic and the HK milk tea was above average.

Hong Kong Bistro Cafe is a pretty good option downtown if you are looking for a HK cafe and really reasonably priced and service is pretty fast. The food won't blow you away but it's pretty good and the portions are pretty big and fulfilling especially for the price point."
Chula Taberna Mexicana,5,2019-03-03,"Awesome food. Great friendly staff. 

Highly recommend the fish tacos. 

If you are in the mood for Mexican and are in the area you won't find better."
Ha Gow Dim Sum House,3,2019-08-13,"We have been here for takeout a few times here. Remember its CASH ONLY so pack those 20 bills. I really liked their dim sum sampler, with classic dumplings like shrimp and seafood. I would recommend the dim sum sampler over their dishes."
Dimmi Bar & Trattoria,3,2018-08-10,"Dimmi was ok but it wasn't anything special. My husband, daughter and I were in Toronto for a quick family vacation. After sight seeing we went to Yorkville to shop. Of course all of the shopping made us hungry. We walked up and down the street to find something to eat. We finally decided on Dimmi. I had a taste for pasta and thought this would be a good choice. It was pretty busy but there was no wait. The staff was very nice and accommodating.

When we first got there my husband and I ordered drinks. He got a Old-Fashioned and I got a Sangria. He enjoyed his drink. My drink started off good but then started to taste like medicine the more I drank it. Needless to say I didn't finish it.

We started our dinner with ordering the Kale as an appetizer. Of course this was a side salad. It consisted of shaved kale with pinenuts and cranberries covered with pecorino cheese in a lemon and olive oil dressing. This salad was very good. The flavors were nice and most of all I enjoyed the pinenuts. They added a nice crunch to the dish. 

For our entrees I ordered the STRO ZZAPRETI ALLA ERNESTO and my husband ordered the Roasted Chicken Breast. My dish consisted of spicy nduja sausage, rapini and cherry tomatoes in garlic and olive oil. This was something different for me but good. The sausage added a nice hint of heat but not too spicy. The pasta was good. It also had cherry tomatoes and spinach. I could have done without the spinach. I like spinach in salads or creamed spinach but I don't like plain cooked down spinach. The texture is odd in my opinion. Other than that this dish was good.  My husband's dish came with vegetables and roasted potatoes. The chicken was pretty tender but flavorless. The whole plate was flavorless for that matter. It was very bland and needed seasoning. My husband ate it but he wasn't thrilled. 

Last, we ended our meal with a dessert. We ordered the Apple Crumble. It came out in a slice but instead of pie crust topping it had a crumble topping. It came with a scoop of ice cream. This dish was decent. It was pretty tasty. It's one of those things that is wasn't bad but it wasn't the best we have had. 

Overall, Dimmi was ok. We enjoyed it but it wasn't anything special."
Stelvio,3,2018-09-25,"Queen West small Italian shop with simple black and white décor, sizeable patio but limited seating inside, typical (you'll get the joke soon) Italian fair with a slight focus on risottos and pastas.

I thought just the décor was black and white, but it turned out the placemats and menus were also black and white - there's a collection of black ink art that reminds me of medieval times when artists worked for months on a simple line drawing to get things just right - whether it was embellishment in a single capital letter, or a decorative flower, or the skull of an animal - because you know, all these are completely related and belong side by side. Nothing wrong with it at all, it was definitely unique and presented artfully. 

The menu is deceptively lengthy - dishes are in Italian then described in English. I've never read a menu that uses ""typical"" as it's adjective of choice so much. Most of my party went for pastas - they were smaller portions than desired. It would've been fine as a lunch portion, but for dinner it was insufficient and taste was simpler than expected (or should I say, typical?). The risotto with veal was actually a highlight despite some other reviews and the portion was actually filling, unlike the gnocchi and ravioli items (those were the smallest!). Overall it was really not bad - but unfortunately underwhelming.

Service is very slow if you're a large group - so please spare them and only come with a few friends. You'll enjoy the ambiance more and sharing more items will be more feasible, and your overall experience will just be that much better! If I'm in the area I suppose I could give it another shot, but for one that values taste over aesthetic, I might not be back."
MEXITACO,5,2020-02-01,"Best Mexican spot hands down in GTA.  
Been to pretty much every spot and the dot compare taste wise and price wise.   
Very authentic very fresh.  
Comparable to the Mexican food I've had in Mexico and while I live veer in NJ.  (The average  Mexican spot in NJ destroys anything in Toronto except this place)

Worth going.   Deserves 5 stars honestly. 




Oh the fried ice cream was legIt fantastic."
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,5,2020-01-17,"Atmosphere: 5
Cleanliness: 5
Quality: 5
Service: 5
Taste: 5

Couldn't secure a reservation during my visit to Toronto but they take walk-ins so that's what I did. The wait for a party of 2 on the evening (the day after new year) was estimated to be about 20 minutes but we were seated before that. 

For drinks I had the regular Thai tea and then later an alcohol version of Thai tea  featuring vodka (yea, you read that right!! IT was rather tasty!)

The spring rolls and tom yum soup were  our appetizers of choice. The rolls were fried with cabbage and mushrooms inside. The soup served with mushrooms and shrimp was flavorful and well balanced.

The khao soi and pad krapow were our entrées of choice. The pad krapow came out with the fried egg and rice and tasted as it should. And khao soi was truly excellent. The curry was  possibly one the best I've tasted .

Overall, Pai lived up to my expectations and to it's name. By the time we walked out, there was a line of people waiting to be seated that went around the block it seemed and when I saw that, I nodded in agreement. Worth the wait!"
Carisma,4,2019-04-30,"This restaurant had nice modern decor and comfortable seating. I went with a group of 9 people and they gave us a large table that was sectioned off so we had some privacy. 

Food wise I would say was ok, like 3.5/5 stars. This is because the portions seemed very small. The calamari appetizer tasted good, mushroom salad appetizer was good but not worth the price in my opinion, the complimentary bread was a bit burnt and too crunchy, the mozarella with tomato wasn't worth the price and was too simple ... For the main course I got the chicken (first item on the menu under secondi). It came with two large pieces of white and dark meat with potatoes, a grilled lemon on top, and some veggies. This was worth the price because of the amount of meat that was given. A few people at my table ordered the gnocchi which looked very plain when it arrived, but tasted ok. The gnocchi is the same price as the chicken and I would say the chicken is worth more. 

Overall, Iikely won't return often to this restaurant due to the portion sizes, however if I had to pick a few items to have again it would be the calamari appetizer and the chicken dish as the main course."
Homemade Ramen,5,2019-02-19,Best chinese ramen in chinatown. I personally like knife shaved noodles and these are of the best I have had around chinatown. They are of a good size and thickness and perfectly chewy. They are very generous with the meat and it was melt in your mouth quality beef brisket.
Ramen Isshin,4,2020-01-15,"Food - I'm a big fan of Spicy Miso so of course I had to get that. This place is known for their spicy miso so, as you can imagine, it's really good. Their broth is rich, tasty, and has a kick to it; I LOVE IT. The noodles and condiments are pretty normal but it's still good. The ramen doesn't come with an egg though so you have to order extra for that. We had the takoyaki and gyoza too. The takoyaki was really good, it's deep fried so the outside is crispy while the inside remains juicy; not convention, I know but its good. Gyoza was pretty good too!

Ambiance - It's a relatively small restaurant with limited seats so be sure to plan ahead if you're coming in as a big group. Aside from that, everything's pretty clean and has a typical ramen shop interior.

Price - my bowl of ramen was around $16 without egg. I thought it was expensive...but its good so maybe its worth it? 

Service - Our host was pretty nice and attentive. Despite the restaurant being busy l, we were still given everything in an orderly manner. 

Overall - Great place if you're a fan of Miso style broth. I heard the other ramen spots might be better if you're not really into miso though!"
La Vecchia Ristorante,3,2019-07-18,"Going to start off this review by saying the food was great. Our table ordered the Caesar salad, gnocchi ragu, lobster pasta, and tagliolini con funghi. Wonderful food. 

Why the 3 stars? Boy, did we have the most annoyingly cocky/rude/ignorant waiter?! This customer service experience was so frustrating that it warranted a Yelp review. 
Upon entering the restaurant, everyone from the host to the bartenders had been amazing. We came on a busy night and we had no reservations, and the host had us seated at the bar while he scrambled to get us a table for 6. The bartender was great company, and we enjoyed our cocktails while waiting for a table. 
Of course once we were seated, we got stuck with this sarcastic douche bag of an employee... suddenly regretted choosing this restaurant just because of this dude. He made a lot of rude comments, maybe he thought he was funny? Somehow the conversation with him had eventually evolved into him reminiscing about getting 'so f**ked up one time' while our family was trying to enjoy our dinner. That was just the icing on the cake. 

The food did actually take a bit long to come out. We had waited a good half hour after ordering. 

If you can tolerate the company of some really rude and (not funny) sarcastic waiters, then I do recommend trying the food here. Otherwise, there are better places to spend $30-50 per person on dinner that will guarantee better service. Hopefully if you do go, you get a better server."
Nodo Restaurant,5,2018-10-26,"We came out for dinner and decided Nodo was the best option tonight.  We were not disappointed. 

The food was delicious. 

We decided on the calamari, pizza and pasta special. Wow!  The flavours were spectacular, the service was attentive.  

We had a minor issue with our meal, and the manager was amazing, dealt with our issues right away. 

We will definitely be back."
Ristorante Sotto Sotto,5,2019-02-06,"What a fantastic place! A hidden gem at that! We had reservations and once we arrived we were immediately seated upstairs in a dim area lit with candles. Our server was lovely and described the specials and menu in detail. I went with the Pappardelle Dei Castelli and Minestrone soup. We were brought some fresh bread and olive oil which was amazing. 

My soup was amazing. Not over done and was tasty. The entree was perfection. You can tell the noodles are homemade and wow that sauce was amazing- I opted for butter cream sauce versus the wine sauce that is typically included. Glad I went this route!! 

We had to try some dessert too so we all split the Gelato Affogato and Devils Chocolate Gelati. Both were satisfying and presented nicely. 

Love this intimate establishment and will definately be back!"
Trattoria Taverniti,1,2018-11-21,"I was in shock with food here...the food was extremely disappointing. For prices that are on par with most mid-range Italian restaurant, the food was horrible.
 
I came here with reservations and we were seated immediately. It was during dinner hours but they only had one staff serving all the tables. With just one server, the service was really slow from bringing us the menus and taking down our orders. 
 
Service:
 
The service was slow since they don't have many staff. 
 
Food:
 
My friend and I ordered two appetizers and two entrees to share. Out of the four items we ordered, only one of the item was decent with the rest being disappointing. 
 
N'duja bruschetta - We were deciding to order a bruschetta and opted for this one because it was different. The menu described this to be a bruschetta with a spicy pork sausage spread drizzled with honey. Although I was aware that this was going to be just a spread on bread, it looked disappointing when it arrived to the table because the spread was so thin. I was expecting something thicker to give it more flavor.  I also looked at other tables bruschetta and it looked very average.
 
Calamari Fritti - Another disappointing appetizer. When this arrived, I was a bit shocked because it didn't even look like there was batter... When my friend and I tried it, we both agreed that there wasn't enough crisp. The dish didn't look appetizing either.  
 
Gnocchi Gorgonzola - I wanted to try the gnocchi since the menu states they are handmade. The pasta came out and I thought the color was unappealing; it was like a greenish/greyish color. I guess it is because this sauce is a nutty creamy sauce. The texture of the gnocchi was chewy and nice. However, I wasn't a fan of the sauce.
 
Tagliatelle al Funghi Misti - This was AWFUL Some of the noodles were stuck together and this is the first time I've experienced this at a restaurant. The menu does mention this is a lighter sauce, and I thought it was a lighter flavor....but I didn't expect it to be less saucy.  There was BARELY any sauce actually.  The sauce was pretty much nonexistent and I felt like eating noodles in water. This pasta had no taste. It was $18 and it was literally just plain noodles without much sauce and flavor; the pasta was very dry. 
 
Overall:
 
I would never return. With most of their pastas ranging from $17-20, I was expecting similar quality to other restaurants in this price range. The tagliatelle was so dry and awful. The bruschetta also barely had any toppings on it."
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos,5,2020-04-22,"I never fully understood the taco genre but my life changed when I had the Baja fish taco. Best taco I've ever had in my life. I think of it often. 

I also had the Pulpo a la Mexicana (octopus), which was also good but I definitely don't love eating octopus in a taco. Biting into a taco with crispy fish is just more satisfying than something chewy, y'know?

A warning to those who are visiting for the first time, there is almost no sitting room in this place so be prepared to bring your tacos elsewhere to eat.

Love this place."
Dumpling House Restaurant,5,2019-05-12,"Literally one of my favorite places we ate in Toronto! We stumbled upon this place in Chinatown and were not disappointed! 

The restaurant itself is small but they employees work quick to get food out fast! As you walk in, you can see the dumplings being made in the window and fried/steamed right there! The price was reasonable, the portions were huge, and the food was delicious! For two of us we definitely over ordered but could not decide what to eat and just got a bit of everything!

We ordered the fried pork dumplings, chicken fried noodles, and green onion pan cake! My favorite was the dumplings but you are at the House of Dumplings! Everything else was fantastic...we had to stop ourselves from licking the plates clean!

If in the area and visiting Chinatown, definitely check it out!!"
La Carnita,3,2019-07-06,"2.5/5 stars. Delicious gourmet tacos, but pricey.

Food: 4/5. Everything I tried was delicious. We started with chips + 3 dips which I would highly recommend.  It came with tomato salsa, corn salsa and guacamole. I also really enjoyed the flavour of my tacos. I got:

- Achiote Chicken. My least favourite but still decent. 
- Crispy Cotija. Basically fried cheese, which you can never go wrong with. 
- Carnita. Pork taco with amazing fixings. This was my absolute favourite. 

We also got a pitcher of one of their daily special drinks, which was a pineapple beer. The glass came rimmed with HEAPS of salt which everyone at my table hated - salt & beer? 


Service & Atmosphere: 2.5/5. Loud & dark space. Hipster in style. Server was nice but visited our table very rarely. There were 5 of us at the table being billed separately. All of our bills were out of order. I had a taco missing from my bill, which got added on to someone else's bill, etc. When we tried to say something to the server she just handed us the debit machine. We ended up figuring out her billing mistakes ourselves and paid each other back the appropriate amounts. 


Value for Money: 2/5. This is where it really falls flat for me. Each MINI taco is about $6.00 each. They can be finished in 2 bites. That's ~$3.00 per bite. They are mini tacos too so you'll need a few of them to feel satisfied."
Swatow Restaurant,4,2020-03-06,"The portions are huge. The place is in chinatown and is always busy. The food is your typical yummy, greasy, Chinese food. 

We had the chicken fried rice and the shrimp noodles. Everything tasted really good"
Fieramosca,4,2017-09-17,"Enjoyed a delicious dinner with my mom on a weeknight after catching a fashion show in Yorkville.

We weren't super starving when we arrived so we each opted just for a main. I ordered a delicious glass of sparkling rose which was lovely.

For my entree, I had the mushroom pasta and it was so good. My mom had the veal piccata and loved it. Service was polite and just attentive enough.

Want to come back to try more dishes and some dessert!"
Taverna Mercatto,3,2019-11-15,"This is go to for us before a game. The food is consistently good. Service is also good with a good offering. Considering the area, it's good value for the money. Atmosphere is quite lively. Pizza is very good ... wood fired. Friendly casual environment. Good place to visit even if you're not attending a game."
El Trompo Taco Bar,2,2019-05-20,"I'm very confused on the tacos we received vs all these amazing reviews...

First timers at Kensington so we decide on this taco joint because Seven Lives was too long around 1:30p. 5 small tacos come in an order and you can only mix and match Al Pastor, Tinga and Chorizo. So we decided to get 2 Tinga and 3 Al Pastor. The tacos literally came out in 2 minutes after ordering. Too quick :3 The taste was bland and unappealing.

I've just attributing this negative review to a bad day at El Trompo..."
DaiLo,2,2019-04-23,"One of the few restaurants I was most excited for but was left the most disappointed... Based on the reviews and pictures I came here with high expectations, unfortunately my experience was very underwhelming.

My friends and I ordered the crispy octopus tacos, hakka brown wontons, torched tamari glazed beef carpaccio, sichuan braised beef and the whole fried giggie trout. My table all agreed that the tacos were delicious and the best out of everything, and since this was the first dish brought to us we had very high hopes for the rest of our dinner. 

The rest of our food were just mediocre - it wasn't BAD but it wasn't to die for either. It honestly tasted like stuff we can make at home, which some people may not mind but my friends and I were expecting the fusion tastes to be more noticeable and long the lines of tastes we've never tried or experienced. The flavours/tastes didn't compliment each other or stood out to us at all, so we didn't really experience the ""fusion"" in any of the dishes except for the tacos. 

Some of the criticism agreed by my entire table for certain dishes were:

- the braised beef tasted exactly like the beef in pho, which is weird because the seasoning is completely different
- the wontons were a bit too salty 
- the trout was a bit too oily for us
- not enough sauces on the beef carpaccio, so it was too plain

Not only were the tastes not there, the portions were ridiculously small for the price (especially the tacos), aside from the trout. We usually order the same amount of food for 4 girls elsewhere and never finish - we finished all of the food here and were still hungry! Our final bill was $200 on the dot after taxes which is supposed to be AVERAGE I guess... but not worth it at DaiLo because we weren't full/satisfied. I feel like we could've spent the same amount elsewhere and gotten a better experience with food and actually be full afterwards. 

Despite the food not meeting our expectations, service was outstanding and impeccable. Our server was very patient with us and answered all of our questions, and explained each dish that came out beautifully. Our waters were always filled, and dishes were cleared quickly so our table was never too crowded. It was very quick to get his attention too when needed. 

Would I come back? Most likely not. I applaud DaiLo for trying with the the whole fusion scene but it just didn't work for us. The ""fusion"" additions they tried weren't enough to make most of the dishes stand out to us, the dishes tasted far too familiar at home... Sucks because we all really wanted to like this place!"
Kit Kat Italian Bar & Grill,4,2019-07-20,"We sat at the patio which has great street view and perfect for summer. But be aware that you can't order drinks if sitting outside.

My girlfriend and I shared calamari and seafood pasta. The calamari wasn't the fried ones as I thought, but still yum, tender and juicy. The seafood pasta had shrimp and mussel was great too, love the tomato sauce they made.

The waiter constantly checked our table and added water, great service.

Overall great dining experience."
Enoteca Sociale,3,2019-08-01,"It's become increasingly clear that ambiance plays almost as big a role in my enjoyment of a meal as the food itself, and this concept was certainly illustrated in spades during my time at Enoteca Sociale.

We arrived around 6:00 on a weekday, and though we didn't have a reservation, we were immediately shown to a table on the patio.

It's a nice patio, admittedly, but there are definitely some problems. The biggest and most obvious issue is the lack of space between the tables. We were sitting between two other tables and there was probably only a few inches separating us and our neighbors. It was less than private, to put it mildly.

We were also sitting underneath some trees and there was some sap or something that kept falling. The diners to our left actually wound up moving because of it, and my dining companion wound up with some gross-looking stuff on her shirt.

It's not exactly an atmosphere conducive to enjoying a quiet, romantic meal, is my point.

Anyway, in terms of the food, Enoteca Sociale is definitely an above-average destination. We were presented with some complimentary bread to snack on, and it was delicious. The bread was fresh and tasty, while the accompanying oil contained a smokiness that I found irresistible.

For my main, I went with the Amatriciana (""Guanciale, tomato, Pecorino Romano & chili""), and aside from the fact that it's an almost comically small portion (I think I ate the whole thing in about two minutes), this is definitely a top-notch bowl of pasta. The tomato sauce contains exactly the sort of deep richness that one covets, while the pasta itself was cooked quite well. The concoction could've been hotter (i.e. it was probably sitting for a few minutes before I got it), but otherwise I really dug the heck out of this.

It's just too bad about that ambiance."
Dimmi Bar & Trattoria,3,2019-10-16,"It was alright, servers very friendly 5/5 food 3/5 wouldn't go out of my way to come back. VERY LOUD."
Trattoria Taverniti,3,2020-02-15,"In a word, mediocre ! Always a hit or miss. Cramped ,over priced and not overly well trained servers. Stick to the basics when ordering & pass on the deserts. Try this place , you may get lucky but it's always a gamble. Sometimes it pays off , sometimes bust...."
Bamboo Kitchen,2,2014-01-12,"Good take-out place with well-priced specials each day for the price of $4.99 before tax.  Went here on a whim and ordered the Sunday specials of eggplant tofu on rice and BBQ chicken leg.  You get what you pay for.  Greasy more than flavourful.  It is delicious in comforting way.  The hot and sour soup was plenty hot but not sour enough.  Service was brisk and abrupt.  Seems to be frequented by students and there's a bit of a language barrier.

Not particularly motivated to try it again in the future no matter what the price point could be."
Sichuan Garden Restaurant,1,2019-05-25,Cockroaches running around.  This place is very dirty and the food isn't nice.  I would not recommend unless you are asking for a stomach ache.
El Nahual Tacos,5,2020-02-10,"We were here with friends for dinner. I love variety and trying new things and they didn't disappoint.  We had the open face tacos and they created some really unique flavour combinations.

We tried one of 6 different open face tacos.  See my pictures. They were all delicious.  The 6 different ones were:
(1) Carrnitas. Braised pulled pork, pickled carrot.
(2) Al Pastor (mild). Marinated pork with dried chiles, spices and achote, onion, cilantro, grilled pineapple.
(3) Black Tiger Shrimp. Garlic crispy cheese on tortilla, onion, grilled peppers, cilantro, avocado salsa.
(4) Fried Fish. Cod marinated with oregano, cilantro, cabbage slaw, cilantro aioli.
(5) Pulled Beef Barbacoa (mild). Slow cooked spiced beef blade, cilantro, onion, avocado salsa.
(6) Chorizo (mild). House-made spiced pork, onion, cilantro, avocado salsa, wrapped in crispy mozzarella.

They had bottled drinks from Jarritos Canada.

Since this food stall is part of The Annex Food Hall, you would use the large seating area, free WiFi, and washrooms of the food hall."
98 Aroma,3,2017-09-01,"5/5 venue. Super clean (even the washrooms) for a Chinatown establishment and beautiful interior design -- traditional Beijing palace style! Super cool place to take a date or someone not so familiar with the Chinese culture for an ""authentic"" experience.......

But 3/5 food. Why? No major flaws with taste or quality, but unfortunately the dishes are just kind of boring. The regional cuisine served here is northeastern Chinese, which is my specialty since I hail from Shandong, as do the owner and some of the staff! I find the dishes very clean in that I feel that 98 Aroma uses less corn starch, oil, sodium, and possibly MSG than many other Chinatown restaurants.

3/5 value. Portion sizes are reasonable, but don't expect anything huge that would last for a week for under $10 like at House of Gourmet, etc. Pricier than most Chinese restaurants, but 98 Aroma can get away with this since they do have a swankier and more fusion feel. Think R&D, but with more Chinese-influence. A good place to take your Caucasian coworkers or in-laws, but not to dine alone just because. 

A few notes about specific dishes-

1. I've had the soups here before and the Hot & Sour soup is actually a huge portion even as a small size. The delicate mushrooms soup is not as substantial, so cannot stand alone as a meal.

2. Do order the Summer Breeze Veggie Salad (vegan) -- and make sure you MIX it well as all the sauce (and flavor) is at the bottom of the bowl. $9.99. Big portion, enough to share between 2 people or have as a lighter meal. I loved the textures and glass noodles.

3. Very mediocre Assorted Delicate Veggies (vegan). Broccoli, celery, carrots, and fried tofu. $14.99. Way too basic.

4. My gfs had the scallion pancakes, which looked more cooked and crispier than the ones my mom makes at home, but gfs enjoyed these. 

5. Can't remember the menu name, but gfs ordered a huge ass chicken udon stew, which was massive. They really liked the chicken and flavors here. 

6. Fried green beans with minced beef -- beans were oily and gfs weren't a fan. $13.99.

They take credit, debit cards at no extra charge. We didn't make a reservation for 7PM on a Friday night and were seated immediately, so customer volume is definitely not as high as it used to be a year ago.

Overall, would return, but only with Chinese food novices or for a special occasion."
Swatow Restaurant,3,2019-08-03,"One of the OG restaurants of Toronto's Chinatown. It is a classic ""hole in the wall"" that has stood the test of time. The surrounding area is slowly but surely undergoing gentrification.  I remember a lot more Chinese supermarkets and aunties selling vegetables and other items along the streets. 

The restaurant is small and cramped. If you have a seat near the kitchen doors, be prepared for the stench every time the door swings open. You don't come here for the ambiance/service. You come here for Chinese food. 

Washrooms are in the basement, as with most restaurants in the area. 

Service is as expected from a Chinese restaurant. Effective. 

Ordered:
""Fish sliced noodle soup"": I chose vermicelli, which is thin rice noodles. The ""fish sliced"" is actually a blend of mystery fish made into a cube pre-cooked and sliced. It's probably the same item used for hotpot. Instead of this topping, I'd recommend the fish balls (you really taste the ""fishiness""). 

The soup is clear and very mild in flavour. It's not overly salty. A plus is the vegetables that accompany the soup. 

Observing the other tables' chow meins, rice dishes etc., I believe Markham Chinese food / Congee Queens provide much better value (quantity:price ratio)"
98 Aroma,5,2018-08-10,We had the sticky pork stir fry with pepper and eggplants. They tasted like authentic Chinese food. There was only a few tables when we went there to eat around 12:30pm on weekday. I feel like the table is a little slick..? And there was a slight smell when you step into this place (this happened somtime
Los Guaca-Moles,1,2019-06-01,"II really, really wanted to just love this place and sorry about the loooong review (i am normally not one to have such an extended view) BUT I made two mistakes today:

1) Cancelling my reservation at Playa Cabana ( the last 5:00 pm spot) to go to this restaurant (SMH)
2) The place is supposed to open at 5,like a dumbass I actually waited until 5:20 when they finally decided they felt like opening.

That kind of slackness will get your business shut down in Toronto, with sooooooooooo many good places to go and eat all within blocks who the hell is really gonna stick around and wait for places to open past the time they should be??? ....ohhhhhhhhh the regret folks.   

When I walked in ,there were only two other people seated ( who also decided to sit outside and wait saw them earlier)..hmm wonder if they too had regret, but anyways onto the experience. Walked in and there was a bartender and 1 person sitting at the bar. So we seat ourselves at the front of the restaurant and it literally took the guy behind the bar 10 min. to finally put down some menus, he goes back to the bar chitty chatty with the guy sitting at the bar another 10 min goes by he  comes back to take the order. We order drinks and food (Sabinita-- layers of refried black beans, cheese, sour cream & guacamole, Poblanito -soft tortilla; mole poblano sauce w/shredded chicken breast; garnished w/sesame seeds) and two Pescado- mole poblano sauce w/shredded chicken breast; garnished w/sesame seeds). 

Slowly two of the wait staff make their way in and the guy behind the bar says something in spanish possibly about being late who knows seems to be the trend here, and then another table of patrons come in and than another the wait staff all of two seem confused and dazed. The Sabinita comes to to the table and I ask the waiter if our drinks are coming he says he doesn't know, 5 min later the rest of the order comes out I ask again about the drinks another guy comes over with a menu I said no I ordered them when I first sat down? Repeated the order ( like really the bartender couldn't remember to send out the friggin drinks when at the time there was a total of 4ppl in the place (I could just imagine if there were more than 12 ppl in this place it would be like chaos to remember OMG all these drinks OMG ....seriously its like amateure night in here).

 He comes back minutes later with the drinks, in all fairness not his fault he didn't take the order initially nor was he the  DUH guy that said didn't know when the drinks were coming, and that is the last time we saw anyone come over,no one came by to check on the table to see if everything was good ( which it was NOT) and the place was not busy 4 tables occupied does not constitute as busy.   

 The Poblanito was just ok , the fish tacos were downright dreadful they were breaded in some sort of cornmeal which  was not an issue but the fish they used had a gelatinous texture and honestly there wasn't a dash of seasoning in the coating or the fish itself  not even the toppings were seasoned. IT WAS BLAND  i could barely get through it so so i doused it with hot sauce and still it stank (tastewise) so I only ate the one left the other one on the plate and covered it with my napkin (RIP).

 So now all I have left is half a beer which i'm chugging so I can get the hell outta there!! I indicate to the waiter that we're ready to leave and the bill arrives and he asked how was it ?  I was blunt, honest said it was terrible he was concerned surprised and wanted specifics, so I went off about the fish he said he would go and let the the guy in the back know ,  I said really you don't have to but off he went came back apologised. I said I guess that is just how its done here the only redeeming thing about this whole meal was the Sabinita & the beer.

 Sad to say but  I'm not one to give 2nd chances when it comes to food & service like I said this city is a ""Food Mecca"" too many other places to go and try, so bottom line I would never venture back to this place, I would rather take my $$ and go around the corner to Barrio Coreano or Tacos El Asador where the service and food at least in my experiences have been consistently great ."
Quetzal,5,2020-02-27,"Mr.H and I were here for a celebratory dinner, right when you walk in this place has a modern and minimalist ambiance, very different from most other mexican restaurants. Like really... I did not see one decorative skull. Lol

I tried two cocktails, the Primaverde and a special for the day called Breakfast in Mexico. Both were amazing!

For food we tried the below:

Tuna Tostada - yummy... the sesame and spice on this really makes it unique.

Seafood cocktail - Mr.H loved it but this was my least favorite dish. I thought it was too tart to enjoy. 

Lamb Masa - One of my favorite from the night, the lamb was so beautifully cooked, extremely delicious. A must try if you love lamb.

Beets - This was ordered from the greens section of the menu and was surprisingly very tasty. The creamy base and seasoning made it a perfect pairing with the grill pork.

Grill Pork - OMG! Served with roasted pineapple and a caramelized onion sauce it was what you'd call ""melts-in-your-mouth"" deliciousness!!! 

I'd heard their meats are amazing so I'm excited to try this place again and maybe have the beef next time. 

The service was perfect and I've certainly added this place to my list of must trys in Toronto."
Xola Mexican Food,1,2020-01-29,"I came her few weeks ago. I straight up saw this lady (pretty sure the owner) handle cash/ scratch her head and touched the food right after. I

Of course I only had a few bites and left the rest cause I was so grossed out. When I was paying for my bill, I let her know what I saw and she started giving racist quotes. ""All the chinese places do the same thing"", and walked away.

I would have just left it and not think twice, but for them to say something like that, that is a big nono. 

McDonalds food is higher quality than this. 

DO NOT COME HERE."
Fudao noodle house,3,2019-04-29,"If you dine at Fudao, you should expect a very generous portion of food (due to their unlimited noodle refill) for an extremely reasonable price. However, what stops me from giving this place a higher rating is that I didn't find myself wanting more throughout the meal. 

I tried the Fudao rice noodle and thai curry and Teppan grill squid skewer. I expected the squid to have a nice grilled/smoky taste but when it came to the table, it appeared to have just been boiled(?) and dipped in sauce. The rice noodle dish presentation is pleasant at first, but then you have to dump all the sides immediately into the boiling pot in order to have everything cooked properly. Once this is done, it becomes just like any other noodle dish. The meat was actually surprisingly soft/tender but only 3 pieces will come with the meal.

Regardless, Fudao does seem to be a popular restaurant in Toronto and was packed when I came, so perhaps it's worth a visit. Personally though, if I was back in town, I wouldn't go out of my way for it unless I just wanted to get full for a cheap price."
Itacate,1,2019-07-08,"I don't usually UPDATE a review; Friday was a disaster.
The owners should provide the staff/customers AIR CONDITIONING, they are sweating into the grill it's so hot (flavour to the tacos?).
The time it took to get 2 tacos was LONG.  Poor interior design, cluttered.  1 of 2 tacos went into the trash (very under cooked).  The tables are cluttered in garbage, food scraps.  They make enough money, pay a teenager to clean.  This place needs HELP.
It was one of those experiences where I'll try other spots on St Clair, over Itacate."
Sugo,4,2020-01-24,"Dropped by Sugo on the west end for some late dinner on a Thursday night. We got there just after 8 but it was still super busy! We had to wait an hour to get a table. However, there is a thrift store nearby so we went and walked around there until the table was ready. 

The food arrived super quickly after we ordered which was really nice. We got the spaghetti and meatballs plate, as well as the rigatoni and garden salad. They do shares plates for $3 off, and I believe its around the same portion as a regular plate. Each plate came up to around $20. The portions are huge!! I think the bolognese spaghetti size is larger than the rose rigatoni just because of the pasta difference but they were both amazing! They also have a lot of sauce at the bottom which I love. I also really liked the meatball which was really big. I feel like there could be more herbs in the dishes but that's also my personal preference. The garden salad had a lot of dressing but it was a pretty good size. We had enough leftover for two takeout boxes for lunch the next day.

The service here is so sweet! They are very welcoming and accommodating with everything. I would recommend coming early to avoid the wait. It is a small restaurant, but I do like how cozy again. I would come back if I'm in the area, also to try the tiramisu!"
House of Gourmet,2,2020-03-30,"Review is for take out. Normally when I order crispy chow mein, other restaurants will separate the sauce and the noodles. Not here, by the time I got home the noodles were all soggy  

The shrimp spring roll was such a disappointment with barely any shrimp, only one bite actually had shrimp in there. 

I ordered via Ritual so I thought the pick up would be simple. There is absolutely no physical distancing at all, the entrance was tight, people were crammed and confused, overall it was chaotic. Improvement needed."
Fusaro’s Kitchen,3,2017-12-10,"I ordered the Siciliana pasta. For the prices that everything is on the menu, it's definitely worth it. We all got a pretty big portion. In terms of taste however, it didn't really blow me away. 

Although the food took quite some time to get to us (30 minutes) the service was great. I had this waitress from Ireland who was quite nice. When I wasn't sure of which wine to get, she also brought me tasters. 

Overall, it's a good place for fairly cheap Italian food but it didn't blow my socks off."
Xola Mexican Food,5,2019-09-24,"If you're in the mood for authentic Mexican this is the place.  Best Margaritas, my favourite guacamole is blue cheese with walnuts: cactus one is also pretty divine.  Amazing mexican music & totally worth every penny."
Mariachi’s Restaurant,1,2018-06-14,"We went with my children to this restaurant and the service was good but the food was mediocre and heavily priced for the value. I ordered a cheese melt, and got more sausage than cheese and the cheese was cheddar (this dish is not done with cheddar). For $40 dollars per person without alcoholic beverages, one would expect so much more. It was 7 pm and the place was empty. Very disappointed. We won't go back!"
Fieramosca,5,2018-09-14,"Very nice quaint Italian bistro known for it's authentic food. The owners close in August to return to Italy and refresh their menu. 
The wine list is diverse from a few regions and wide range of prices. Many great selections that are reasonable. 
The food menu has many different choices of pastas and meats. 
We had the mozzarella and tomatoes which unfortunately was pretty dry and tasteless. Salt and balsamic to sage the day!
My wife had a fusilli with chicken and eggplant in a pink sauce that was excellent. I had the spaghetti with shrimp and chicken with a garlic white wine sauce that I smelled the second I walked thru the door. It was amazing!! Spot on in every way. 
We were sitting for a while talking to a regular guest of the place (3-4x/week) and the owner sat down and talked with us, as she does with many of the guests. After a few minutes she said she was going into the kitchen for desert. She brought out a slice of heaven!! A tiramisu that is to die for!! Light, sweet and aromatic of espresso, of course homemade. A superb ending to a wonderful meal. 
This is a gem of a restaurant. Need reservations."
Good Hombres,3,2020-05-04,"After reading that they make their tortillas in- house, I was excited to come here for some tacos. For lunch, I ordered the chamberete (beef shank) and pescado (haddock). ""S"" on the menu indicates the taco is spicy. Since I have low heat/spice tolerance, I asked if they could make it mild. 

The tacos were smaller than other taco joints, but they are cheaper in price ($3.75 vs. $5-8). The tortilla was thin and soft yet it was still able to hold the filling/topping.

In terms of flavours and the protein, I didn't find it too memorable. The beef shank was a bit dry but the haddock was freshly fried.

Whilst sitting at the bar waiting for my food, I noticed that the staff worked like a well-oiled team!"
Chula Taberna Mexicana,2,2019-07-27,"When did Gerrard and Jones become a popular destination? Good on it. 

Quick summary:

- nice rooftop patio
- I had slowish service
- Food was good. We had a churizo bowl and the ceviche. Both were solid. I didn't notice anything special about the menu. Standard upper-middle level Mexican foods. 
- Drinks ok (cider + tequila based fruity blend).
- overpriced. Why is Mexican food so expensive in Toronto? It's mostly bloody rice, tomatoes, lettuce, avo, standard meats.
- The staff was decent not great but it was busy hence the pressure of Friday night at play. 
- Personally I wouldn't go back at that pricing but if you don't mind that you may like the food. 

2/5 maybe 2.5. 

Tears for Mcguiggan's."
Quetzal,3,2019-12-03,"I was very excited about trying Quetzal. Upon arrival the ambiance was great, with candlelit tables and a curved ceiling, like being inside of a ship. The bar seating was inviting and the drinks menu was inventive and cocktails were superior with great notes for sipping.

For the food we did the tasting menu, since there were many unique dishes that we wanted to try. The sea bream and scallop ceviche was underwhelming, with the scallops being were quite small and not fresh tasting. The other sushi grade fish - the kanpchi tiradito - was good in comparison. The thin crispy Masa round was similar to a taco pizza, and a fun app to share. 

Next up, the kale salad was tasty and served with the full stems. The bone marrow came with two large bones but didn't seem to have enough flavour cooked into it. Lastly, the skirt steak and 18oz rib eye were served. We were never asked how we liked it cooked when ordering, but we received medium rare which worked out to our tastes. 

Overall, great value for a lot of food and high quality ingredient based dishes, but nothing stood out at the end of the night. I was hoping for a little more bite. 

It's a beautiful restaurant otherwise, and maybe I'm just not the right fit for palette."
Dimmi Bar & Trattoria,1,2020-02-09,"Not even going to talk about the food here because the service here was abysmal. We asked for 3 cups of hot water and were charged $1.50/cup. When we asked the waiter why they charge for hot water they mentioned that all restaurants in yorkville charge for water. After suggesting some of the restaurants  we regularly visit that offer complimentary hot water, the waitress said, ""I guess those restaurants aren't high end anyway...""

I'm sorry, kasa moto and one have $$$ and $$$$ ratings while this barn has $$. Snobs."
Artisan Plus,3,2020-01-21,"3.5/5 

Came here for a quick lunch since I heard a lot about the Yonge and finch location of this noodle spot. We were quickly sat down and  able to place our order. 

We both got the Biang Biang Mien since it was recommended by the waitress and seemed to be the most popular item from others who came to this place. 

The noodles were interesting given the variety of different toppings that you wouldn't necessarily think go together, but I liked the mixed noodles concept. My biggest issue was that despite there being so many different toppings, the noodles tastes bland and didn't have much flavour to them. It seemed like the toppings weren't cooked enough to bring out the flavours or salted enough to help. 

Overall an interesting noodle concept but I don't think I'd return again."
El Catrin Destileria,3,2020-02-01,"El Catrin is good! Located in the heart of Toronto's Distillery District, it prides itself on its traditional Mexican-style cuisine in a casual, yet oh-so-slightly-upscale atmosphere.

The interior is very tastefully decorated and the restaurant features a large outdoor patio equipped with giant space heaters for colder days.

I went to El Catrin for lunch and tried the Pepito torta while my companion had the Huevos Rancheros. The steak sandwich was really well marinated and super tender. Go for it! Oh, and we had the tableside-made guacamole with the tortilla chips (which turned out to be pretty excellent). You should go for that as well.

There aren't too many great options for food near Corktown/Distillery District, so give El Catrin a try next time you're around."
